This is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 303 639 filed Nov. 25 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6 976 493 which is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 929 609 now abandoned filed Aug. 14 2001 both applications of which are incorporated by reference herein.

The present invention relates to smoking articles and in particular to wrapping materials suitable for use as components of those smoking articles.

Popular smoking articles such as cigarettes have a substantially cylindrical rod shaped structure and include a charge roll or column of smokable material such as shredded tobacco e.g. in cut filler form surrounded by a paper wrapper thereby forming a so called smokable rod or tobacco rod. Normally a cigarette has a cylindrical filter element aligned in an end to end relationship with the tobacco rod. Typically a filter element comprises plasticized cellulose acetate tow circumscribed by a paper material known as plug wrap. Certain cigarettes incorporate a filter element having multiple segments and one of those segments can comprise activated charcoal particles. Typically the filter element is attached to one end of the tobacco rod using a circumscribing wrapping material known as tipping paper. It also has become desirable to perforate the tipping material and plug wrap in order to provide dilution of drawn mainstream smoke with ambient air. Descriptions of cigarettes and the various components thereof are set forth Davis et al. Eds. 1999. Various properties of paper materials used for cigarette manufacture and of the cigarettes manufactured using those papers are set forth in Durocher 188 194 March 1985 .

A cigarette is employed by a smoker by lighting one end thereof and burning the tobacco rod. The smoker then receives mainstream smoke into his her mouth by drawing on the opposite end e.g. the filter end of the cigarette. During the time that the cigarette is not being drawn upon by the smoker that cigarette remains burning. Also during the time that the cigarette is not being drawn upon sidestream smoke is generated and directly enters the atmosphere from the lit end of the cigarette.

Numerous attempts have been made to provide cigarettes that generate relatively low levels of visible sidestream smoke. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 924 888 to Perfetti et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 143 098 to Rogers et al. Certain attempts to reduce the levels of visible sidestream smoke generated by cigarettes have involved the use of tobacco rods having multiple layers of circumscribing wrapping materials. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 998 543 to Goodman U.S. Pat. No. 5 220 930 to Gentry and U.S. Pat. No. 5 271 419 to Arzonico et al.

Numerous references propose applying films to the paper wrapping materials of tobacco rods. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 1 909 924 to Schweitzer U.S. Pat. No. 4 607 647 to Dashley and U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 675 to Milford et al.

Numerous attempts have been made to control the manner that a cigarette burns when that cigarette is not being drawn upon. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 2 666 437 to Lattof U.S. Pat. No. 3 030 963 to Cohn U.S. Pat. No. 4 146 040 to Cohn U.S. Pat. No. 4 453 553 to Cohn U.S. Pat. No. 4 489 650 to Weinert U.S. Pat. No. 4 489 738 to Simon and U.S. Pat. No. 4 615 345 to Durocher.

Banded paper wrapping materials that are used for cigarette manufacture possess segments defined by the composition location and properties of the various materials within those wrapping materials. Numerous references contain disclosures suggesting various banded wrapping material configurations. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 1 996 002 to Seaman U.S. Pat. No. 1 999 222 to Wienberger U.S. Pat. No. 2 013 508 to Seaman U.S. Pat. No. 4 452 259 to Norman et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 889 145 to Adams et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 417 228 to Baldwin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 753 to Peterson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 754 to Peterson et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 198 537 to Bokelman et al. US Pat. Application 2002 0139381 to Peterson et al. and PCT WO 02 37991 and PCT WO 02 55294. Methods for manufacturing banded type wrapping materials have been proposed. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 739 775 to Hampl Jr. U.S. Pat. No. 4 945 932 to Mentzel et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 474 095 to Allen et al. and PCT WO 02 44700 and PCT WO 02 055294. Banded papers having segments of paper fibrous cellulosic material or particulate material adhered to a paper web also have been proposed. See U.S. Pat. No. 5 191 906 to Myracle Jr. U.S. Pat. No. 5 263 999 to Baldwin et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 417 228 to Baldwin et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 450 863 to Collins et al. and US Pat. Application 2002 0092621 to Suzuki.

It would be desirable to provide a cigarette manufacturer with a manner or method to produce a cigarette that possesses controlled burn characteristics resulting from alterations to the wrapping material of the tobacco rod of that cigarette.

The present invention relates to wrapping materials for smoking articles and to methods for making those wrapping materials. The present invention also relates to smoking articles such as cigarettes that are manufactured using those wrapping materials. The wrapping material incorporates at least one fibrous material e.g. flax fibers hardwood pulp fibers and or softwood pulp fibers and most preferably incorporates at least one filler material e.g. an inorganic essentially water insoluble material such as calcium carbonate in particulate form . The wrapping material has deposited thereon or otherwise applied thereto at least one layer of coating and most preferably a multi layer coating in the form of a predetermined pattern.

In one aspect the wrapping material possesses a coating in the form of a plurality of spaced apart bands. Each band possesses a series of layers and those layers each can be continuous layers. Each layer most preferably comprises a film forming material such as a polymeric resin. A highly preferred film forming material is ethylcellulose. At least one of the coating layers can have a filler material dispersed or suspended within the other components of the formulation used to provide that coating layer. A highly preferred filler is provided by particles of calcium carbonate.

In one aspect the wrapping material is composed of a base sheet having a major surface and possessing a plurality of bands applied to that major surface in the form of a pattern. Each band possesses at least two layers and each layer can be a continuous layer. Those layers include a first or bottom layer applied to a major surface of the base sheet and a top layer applied over that bottom layer. In one aspect the bottom layer has a width greater than that of the top layer. In another aspect the bottom layer has a width essentially equal to that of the top layer. In another aspect the top layer has a width greater than that of the bottom layer. If desired at least one layer of coating i.e. a primary coating can be applied to the major surface prior to application of the aforementioned pattern. If desired at least one layer of coating i.e. an overcoating can be applied to the major surface after application of the aforementioned pattern.

In another aspect the wrapping material is composed of a base sheet having a major surface and possessing a plurality of bands applied to that major surface in the form of a pattern. Each band possesses at least three layers. Those layers include a first or bottom layer applied to a major surface of the base sheet a middle layer applied over that bottom layer and a top layer applied over that middle layer. In one aspect the widths of all of the layers are essentially equal to one another. In one aspect the bottom layer has a width different from that of the middle layer and the middle layer has a width essentially equal to or different from that of the top layer. In another aspect the bottom layer has a width essentially equal to that of the middle layer and the middle layer has a width different than that of the top layer. The width of the bottom layer can be greater than that of the middle layer and the width of the middle layer can be greater than that of the top layer. Either or both of the middle and top layers can have widths that are greater than that of the bottom layer. The top layer can have a width that is greater than that of the middle layer. For a layer that has a width different from that of another layer each of those layers most preferably are positioned relative to one another so that both of the ends of that each layer are equally off set relative to the respective ends of other layer. If desired at least one layer of coating can be applied to the major surface prior to application of the aforementioned pattern. If desired at least one layer of coating can be applied to the major surface after application of the aforementioned pattern.

In another aspect the wrapping material is composed of a base sheet having a major surface and possessing a plurality of bands applied to that major surface in the form of a pattern. Each band possesses at least four layers and each layer can be a continuous layer. Those layers include a first or bottom layer applied to a major surface of the base sheet a second or bottom middle layer applied over that bottom layer a third or top middle layer applied over the second layer and a fourth or top layer applied over the third layer. For each band the layer that is applied directly to the wrapping material i.e. the first or bottom layer has a second layer applied thereto. The width of the second layer can be essentially the same as greater than or less than that of the first layer. For a second layer that has a width different from that of the first layer the second layer most preferably is positioned relative to the first layer so that both of the ends of that second layer are equally off set relative to the ends of the first layer. The second layer has a third layer applied thereto. The width of the third layer can be essentially the same as greater than or less than that of the second layer. For a third layer that has a width different from that of the second layer the third layer most preferably is positioned relative to the second layer so that both of the ends of that third layer are equally off set relative to the ends of the second layer. The third layer has a fourth layer applied thereto. The width of the fourth layer can be essentially the same as greater than or less than that of the third layer. For a fourth layer that has a width different from that of the third layer the fourth layer most preferably is positioned relative to the third layer so that both of the ends of that fourth layer are equally off set relative to the ends of the third layer. If desired at least one layer of coating can be applied to the major surface prior to application of the aforementioned pattern. If desired at least one layer of coating can be applied to the major surface after application of the aforementioned pattern.

In accordance with the present invention at least one layer of coating and most preferably several layers of coating formulation are applied to a wrapping material preferably using a printing process. Most preferably the coating formulation is applied using intaglio processes. As such gravure coating techniques such as rotogravure printing techniques are particularly preferred. Other techniques for the coating formulation to the wrapping material include blade coating air knife coating roll coating and shaft coating techniques. Alternatively and or additionally the layers of coating formulation can be applied by spraying ink jet coating or other similar coating techniques. A printed wrapping material is provided with a pattern such as is provided by application of at least one additive material to a formed wrapping material. The pattern is applied to the wrapping material in a so called offline fashion i.e. offline relative to the manufacture of that wrapping material .

Gravure printing techniques involve printing from the continuous surface of a metal cylinder engraved mechanically or etched chemically so as to possess minute grooves or cells below the surface of that cylinder. A typical printing cylinder surface is provided by etching a smooth polished copper surface and plating that etched surface with chrome. Those recessed cells or grooves hold liquid or liquid dispersion formulations form impressions layers or bumps to be deposited onto the desired location of a substrate such as a continuous web of paper wrapping material. Rotogravure printing presses have been commercially available from Bobst Champlain Inc. from Cerutti S.p.A. from Rotomek S.p.A. from Intra Roto Inc. as Merkur Heliostar from Wirdmoller Holscher and KBA TR 7B from Albert Frankenhal AG. Gravure printing techniques are described in Pocket Pal published by International Paper Company 1970 Scarlett et al. What the Printer Should Know About Ink 1984 and Gravure Process and Technology Grav. Educ. Fdn. and Grav. Assoc. Amer. 1991 . Thus the selection and operation of gravure printing equipment will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art of printing. See for example US Pat. Application 2002 0139381 to Peterson et al. Equipment and techniques for applying coatings and inks to paper wrapping materials suitable for the manufacture of tobacco rods for cigarettes are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 675 to Milford et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 753 to Peterson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 754 to Peterson et al. and PCT WO 02 37991. See also U.S. Pat. No. 4 474 110 to Rosner.

Referring to there is shown a gravure printing press of the type useful for printing desired components as predetermined patterns onto wrapping materials. In operation a wrapping material is unwound from a large payout roll . The payout roll is shown rotating in a clockwise direction causing the continuous web of wrapping material to travel in the direction shown by arrow . The size of the payout roll can vary and an exemplary payout roll provides a continuous sheet of about 31 inches wide and about 16 000 meters in length. The continuous web of wrapping material is passed in succession through a plurality printing stations and drying stations shown as a series of four printing stations and and four drying stations . The resulting printed and dried web then is wound onto a take up roll i.e. the wrapping material is adapted in such a manner that it can be wound on or as a roll .

The take up roll then is unwound and slit to provide a plurality of webs of the desired size and those webs are re wound into bobbins for use on cigarette making machines for the manufacture of tobacco rods for cigarettes not shown . Dried wrapping materials of the present invention preferably have residual liquid carrier or solvent levels that are less than about 300 mg ream a ream being 3 000 square feet .

The first printing station includes a first etched printing cylinder that is rotated clockwise through a first liquid or liquid dispersion coating mixture or printing formulation . That printing formulation or ink is located in a first trough or pan and some of that ink within that trough is picked up onto the printing surface face not shown of that cylinder . An exemplary printing cylinder is a metal cylinder having a cylinder face length of about 54 inches and a diameter of about 11.28 inches and such a cylinder can have an etched region sufficient to print the web in the desired manner e.g. a 31 inch etched region on the cylinder face is sufficient to print a web of 31 inch width . Optionally the cylinder and the trough containing the ink can be equipped with heating equipment not shown . Heating of the ink to elevated temperatures is desirable for certain printing formulations that might otherwise exhibit relatively high viscosities at temperatures approximating those of ambient conditions.

A first doctor blade e.g. a steel blade extending along the printing surface face of the cylinder is located downstream from the trough and is positioned against the etched surface of the first printing cylinder in a manner so as to wipe off surplus ink from that cylinder while allowing the desired ink for printing to be retained within the etched grooves of that cylinder. The continuous web of wrapping material passes through a tension compensation roll system and between the first printing cylinder and a first impression cylinder . When that wrapping material passes the region between the printing cylinder and the impression cylinder the compressive forces provided between the surfaces of those two cylinders cause the ink to be transferred from the printing cylinder and to be pressed onto and hence applied to the wrapping material. Depending upon the pattern etched into the surface of the printing cylinder a pattern is printed onto a major surface not shown of the wrapping material. The amount of ink deposited onto the substrate in a particular region of that substrate depends upon factors such as the depth of each etched cell the area of each cell and the spacing between the cells. Great numbers of relatively large volume etched cells that are closely spaced allow a relatively large amount of ink to be deposited onto a substrate. The ink is printed onto the major surface of the wrapping material in the form of a discrete layer or bump.

After the coating formulation is applied to the wrapping material the carrier liquid or liquid solvent of the ink is removed from the wrapping material. Typically the liquid is removed by evaporation techniques which usually are provided by heating the wrapping material. As such printed wrapping material is passed through a first dryer to remove liquid solvent or carrier e.g. by evaporation from the printed region of the wrapping material. An exemplary dryer is a gas fired high velocity forced air oven having a longitudinally extending heating space of about 40 feet. Typically the dryer is set to a desired temperature e.g. about 140oF and a given portion of the printed wrapping material is present within the dryer for about 1 second to about 5 seconds and normally about 2 to about 3 seconds. Each respective dryer can be set at a different temperature depending upon factors such as the volatility and amount of the particular liquid solvent or carrier. Typically the wrapping material is heated and treated sufficiently to remove residual solvent of the coating formulation such that any residual amount of solvent is present in an amounts that are low enough to not adversely affect to any significant degree the performance characteristics chemical nature or sensory characteristics of the smoke generated by a smoking article manufactured from that wrapping material.

The continuous web of wrapping material then is passed through a second printing station . The second printing station includes a second etched printing cylinder that is rotated clockwise through a second liquid or liquid dispersion coating mixture or printing formulation . That printing formulation or ink is located in a second trough or pan and some of that ink within that trough is picked up onto the printing surface face not shown of that cylinder . Optionally the ink can be subjected to elevated temperatures by heating the cylinder and trough .

A second doctor blade is located downstream from the trough and is positioned against the etched surface of the second printing cylinder in a manner so as to wipe off surplus ink from that cylinder while allowing the desired ink for printing to be retained within the etched grooves of that cylinder. The continuous web of wrapping material passes through a tension compensation roll system and between the second printing cylinder and a second impression cylinder . The ink is transferred from the printing cylinder and hence applied to the wrapping material when that wrapping material passes the region between the printing cylinder and the impression cylinder . Depending upon the pattern etched into the surface of the printing cylinder a second pattern is printed onto a major surface not shown of the wrapping material. The ink is printed onto the major surface of the wrapping material in the form of a discrete layer or bump. The printed wrapping material then is passed through a second dryer to remove liquid solvent or carrier e.g. by evaporation from the printed region of the wrapping material. Preferably the ink of the second printing station is printed directly on top of the previously printed layer that is using types of printing techniques known as trap printing. 

The continuous web of wrapping material then is passed through third and fourth printing stations and third and fourth drying stations respectively and successively. The types of components and manner of operation of those third and fourth printing stations and drying stations are essentially identical to those of the first two printing and drying stations that have been described previously. Besides the printing press of the type shown in i.e. a press possessing four printing stations similar types of printing presses possessing other numbers of printing stations e.g. 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 printing stations can be employed.

Certain printing stations of the printing press can be modified if desired. For example certain printing stations can be suitably configured so as to allow printing on both sides i.e. on both major surfaces on the wrapping material. Additionally printing stations can be suitably configured with heating apparatus so as to allow certain film forming materials to be printed in a solid i.e. solvent free form.

The various printed layers are aligned or registered in order that a coating of a predetermined pattern can by provided on a major surface of the wrapping material. It is most desirable to employ automatic detection devices and in order to identify and control the positioning of various coated layers and hence provide for alignment or registration of those layers. Each respective detector system is positioned downstream of the print cylinder impression cylinder combination detects that just printed bump and provides an output for controlling registration of the printing of a subsequent coating layer on top of the previously printed layer. Such automatic detection devices are particularly useful for registering the application of multiple printing formulations upon materials that are moving at relatively high speeds e.g. in excess of about 500 feet minute . Suitable automatic detection devices are those optical detection devices that operate in the visible ultraviolet or near infrared range. As such an appropriate sensor is linked to a computer and or controller that can perform the function of automatically controlling the location at which subsequent printing cylinders apply the various layers into the desired printed pattern i.e. there is control of the registration of the various printed layers .

Certain coating formulations such as those that are clear and colorless can be difficult to align particularly when using visual alignment techniques. In order to employ detection devices such as visible and ultraviolet sensors in order to assist in locating printed layers on the wrapping material it is often desirable to incorporate an effective amount of a suitable optical brightener into the coating formulation. Exemplary registration systems include the Autotron 2600D from PressTech Controls Ltd. the View Point Vision System from CC1 the PC3100 series systems available from Eltromat Electronics Inc. and those ultraviolet detection systems available from Dr. Grobel UV Elektronic GmbH. Such types of systems can be used for quality control purposes as well as for ensuring the proper desired alignment of the numerous printed layers of the desired pattern.

Typically registration marks in the dead space on either extreme side of the wrapping material are identified using suitable detection equipment and the collected data associated with the location of a printed layer are used to align and register the location where subsequent layers are printed using subsequent printing cylinders. It also is desirable to provide each cylinder printing face with a marked reference point to provide a unique printed shape onto the dead space region on the opposite side of the wrapping material at a predetermined location. As such a machine operator can manually identify those printed marks e.g. through the use of a suitable strobe light compare the location of those marks and determine whether or not subsequent printing cylinders are properly applying subsequent printing formulations in the appropriate locations. In the event that the various layers are not being applied in the desired locations adjustment of the operation of subsequent printing cylinders can be made in order to ensure proper alignment of the various printed layers.

If desired the wrapping material can be evaluated to determine its porosity and basis weight prior to the time that the wrapping material is wound onto the take up roll. Typical devices designed for determining the porosity and coating weight of the printed wrapping material often do not provide accurate and reliable measurement of wrapping material that travels at the relatively high speeds common during the use of gravure printing equipment. Although a printed sample can be obtained from a roll and evaluated for proper porosity and coating weight it is desirable to measure those properties of a printed wrapping material in an online fashion particularly to help ensure consistent and effective application of printing formulation. In order to facilitate automatic online measurement of porosity and coating weight e.g. using equipment available from sources such as Borgwaldt and Extrol respectively a festoon system similar to those found on typical gravure presses is incorporated into the printing press particularly in that region of the printing press after the last printing cylinder and before the take up roll. In the region of that festoon system are located the application weight sensors and porosity inspection systems. The decrease in the speed of travel of the wrapping material in the region of the festoon system provides the opportunity for appropriate measurement devices to record readings accurately. As such appropriate adjustments to the process conditions readily can be make in the event that wrapping material that is out of specification is observed.

Operation of a festoon system and its use to measure and control properties of a printed wrapping material can be described as follows. After the final print station an outfeed nip is employed to control the tension of the running web. After this outfeed nip region a festoon section is employed to accumulate web in the desired time increments. A second separate outfeed nip following the festoon section controls tension of the web prior to winding on a take up roll. Typically when measurements are taken on the printed web the winding speed of the finished roll is reduced while the printing equipment continues to maintain a steady production speed. The additional printed web that is not wound on the finished roll accumulates in the festoon section as the portion of the web beyond the festoon slows down to an appropriate speed for accurate online measurement. Once the appropriate measurements are recorded the finished roll is allowed to regain speed to the appropriate line speed and remove the excess web from the festoon section. Such process steps occur in the desired time increments dictated by the components necessary for desired process control.

After printing is complete the printed wrapping material then can be taken from take up roll and slit to the desired dimensions. Slit wrapping materials normally are provided in the form of bobbins for use on conventional cigarette manufacturing equipment. An exemplary slit wrapping material is about 27 mm across and as such can be used to provide a tobacco rod of about 24.5 mm circumference and about 2.5 mm for an overlap seam or lap zone for an adhesive line. The wrapping material can be slit to other dimensions depending up factors such as the desired circumference of the tobacco rod and the desired overlap for the adhesive line.

Referring to there is shown a portion of a slit web of printed wrapping material shown as cut away at each end. The printed wrapping material possesses a base sheet and there are two bands shown as being printed on the upper major surface of the wrapping material and positioned so as to extend transversely to the longitudinal axis of the wrapping material. The printed wrapping material has a length across L of about 27 mm. The bands are shown as each having a width w and the bands are spaced apart by a distance d. It is most highly preferred that the bands each are continuous bands i.e. those bands totally cover the regions of the wrapping material over which they are printed and no portion of the wrapping material remains unprinted within the banded regions . However certain preferred continuous bands can be composed of two or more layers and at least one of those layers can have the form of discontinuous patterns.

Referring to there are shown the components of a smoking article in the form of a cigarette. The cigarette includes a generally cylindrical rod of a charge or roll of smokable filler material contained in a circumscribing wrapping material of the present invention. The rod is conventionally referred to as a tobacco rod . The ends of the tobacco rod are open to expose the smokable filler material. At one end of the tobacco rod is the lighting end and at the other end is shown a filter element . The cigarette is shown as having one printed band on printed wrapping material and that band circumscribes the cigarette rod in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the cigarette. That is the band provides a cross directional region relative to the longitudinal axis of the cigarette. The band can be printed on the inner surface of the wrapping material i.e. facing the smokable filler material or on the outer surface of the wrapping material. Although the cigarette shown in possesses wrapping material having one band the cigarette also can possess wrapping material having spaced bands numbering two three or more.

The cigarette normally includes a filter element or other suitable mouthpiece positioned adjacent one end of the tobacco rod such that the filter element and tobacco rod are axially aligned in an end to end relationship preferably abutting one another. Filter element has a generally cylindrical shape and the diameter thereof is essentially equal to the diameter of the tobacco rod. The ends of the filter element are open to permit the passage of air and smoke therethrough. The filter element includes filter material e.g. plasticized cellulose acetate tow that is overwrapped along the longitudinally extending surface thereof with circumscribing plug wrap material . The filter element can have two or more filter segments and or flavor additives incorporated therein.

The filter element is attached to the tobacco rod by tipping material which circumscribes both the entire length of the filter element and an adjacent region of the tobacco rod. The inner surface of the tipping material is fixedly secured to the outer surface of the plug wrap and the outer surface of the wrapping material of the tobacco rod using a suitable adhesive. A ventilated or air diluted smoking article is provided with an air dilution means such as a series of perforations each of which extend through the tipping material and plug wrap.

The tobacco rod the filter element and the cigarette resulting from the combination thereof can be manufactured using conventional cigarette and cigarette component manufacturing techniques and equipment without any extensive modification if any to those conventional techniques and equipment. Manners and methods suitable for the commercial production of cigarettes of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette manufacture.

Cigarettes of the present invention possessing tobacco rods manufactured using certain appropriately treated wrapping materials of the present invention when tested using the methodology set forth in the Cigarette Extinction Test Method by the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST Publication 851 1993 using 10 layers of Whatman No. 2 filter paper meet criteria requiring extinction of greater than about 50 percent preferably greater than about 75 percent and most preferably about 100 percent of cigarettes tested. Preferably each cigarette possesses at least one band located in a region of its tobacco rod such that the band is capable of providing that cigarette with the ability to meet those cigarette extinction criteria. For a tobacco rod of a particular length incorporating a wrapping material possessing bands that are aligned transversely to the longitudinal axis of the wrapping material in a spaced apart relationship the ratio of the length of the tobacco rod to the sum of the width of a band and the distance between the bands is 1 to 2 preferably about 1.1 to about 1.4 and most preferably about 1.2.

For an exemplary full flavor cigarette having a tobacco rod length of about 63 mm and a filter element length of about 21 mm cross directional bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 20 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. Alternatively for those types of cigarettes bands of about 4 mm width can be spaced at about 22 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. Alternatively for those types of cigarettes bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 39 mm intervals. For an exemplary full flavor cigarette having a tobacco rod length of about 70 mm and a filter element length of about 30 mm cross directional bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 44 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. For an exemplary ultra low tar cigarette having a tobacco rod length of about 57 mm and a filter element length of about 27 mm cross directional bands of about 7 mm width can be spaced at about 20 mm intervals. Alternatively for those types of cigarettes bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 33 mm intervals or at about 39 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. For an exemplary ultra low tar cigarette having a tobacco rod length of about 68 mm and a filter element length of about 31 mm cross directional bands of about 6 mm width can be spaced at about 44 mm intervals on the wrapping materials used to manufacture those cigarettes. Full flavor cigarettes are classified as those that yield about 14 mg or more of FTC tar. Ultra low tar cigarettes are classified as those that yield less than about 7 mg of FTC tar. Those cigarettes which possess tobacco rods having appropriate wrapping materials possessing bands composed of appropriate amounts of appropriate components have the ability to meet the aforementioned cigarette extinction criteria.

Cigarettes of the present invention can be manufactured from a variety of components and can have a wide range of formats and configurations. Typical cigarettes of the present invention having cross directional bands applied to the wrapping materials of the tobacco rods of those cigarettes have static burn rates i.e. burn rates of those cigarettes under non puffing conditions of about 50 to about 60 mg tobacco rod weight per minute in the non banded regions of those cigarettes. Typical cigarettes of the present invention having cross directional bands applied to the wrapping materials of the tobacco rods of those cigarettes have static burn rates i.e. burn rates of those cigarettes under non puffing conditions of less than about 50 mg tobacco rod weight per minute preferably about 40 to about 45 mg tobacco rod weight per minute in the banded regions of those cigarettes.

The tobacco materials used for the manufacture of cigarettes of the present invention can vary. Descriptions of various types of tobaccos growing practices harvesting practices and curing practices are set for in Tobacco Production Chemistry and Technology Davis et al. Eds. 1999 . The tobacco normally is used in cut filler form e.g. shreds or strands of tobacco filler cut into widths of about 1 10 inch to about 1 60 inch preferably about 1 20 inch to about 1 35 inch and in lengths of about inch to about 3 inches . The amount of tobacco filler normally used within a cigarette ranges from about 0.6 g to about 1 g. The tobacco filler normally is employed so as to filler the tobacco rod at a packing density of about 100 mg cm3 to about 300 mg cm3 and often about 150 mg cm3 to about 275 mg cm3. Tobaccos can have a processed form such as processed tobacco stems e.g. cut rolled or cut puffed stems volume expanded tobacco e.g. puffed tobacco such as propane expanded tobacco and dry ice expanded tobacco DIET or reconstituted tobacco e.g. reconstituted tobaccos manufactured using paper making type or cast sheet type processes .

Typically tobacco materials for cigarette manufacture are used in a so called blended form. For example certain popular tobacco blends commonly referred to as American blends comprise mixtures of flue cured tobacco burley tobacco and Oriental tobacco and in many cases certain processed tobaccos such as reconstituted tobacco and processed tobacco stems. The precise amount of each type of tobacco within a tobacco blend used for the manufacture of a particular cigarette brand varies from brand to brand. See for example Tobacco Encyclopedia Voges Ed. p. 44 45 1984 Browne The Design of Cigarettes 3rd Ed. p. 43 1990 and Tobacco Production Chemistry and Technology Davis et al. Eds. p. 346 1999 . Other representative tobacco blends also are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4 924 888 to Perfetti et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 056 537 to Brown et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 220 930 to Gentry and Bombick et al. Fund. Appl. Toxicol. 39 p. 11 17 1997 . See also PCT WO 02 37990.

If desired in addition to the aforementioned tobacco materials the tobacco blend of the present invention can further include other components. Other components include casing materials e.g. sugars glycerine cocoa and licorice and top dressing materials e.g. flavoring materials such as menthol . The selection of particular casing and top dressing components is dependent upon factors such as the sensory characteristics that are desired and the selection of those components will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette design and manufacture. See Gutcho Tobacco Flavoring Substances and Methods Noyes Data Corp. 1972 and Leffingwell et al. Tobacco Flavoring for Smoking Products 1972 .

Smoking articles also can incorporate at least one flavor component within the side seam adhesive applied to the wrapping material during the manufacture of the tobacco rods. That is for example various flavoring agents can be incorporated in a side seam adhesive CS 2201A available from National Starch and applied to the seam line of the wrapping material. Those flavoring agents are employed in order to mask or ameliorate any off taste or malodor provided to the smoke generated by smoking articles as a result of the use of the wrapping materials of the present invention such as those wrapping materials having printing formulations incorporating ethylcellulose nitrocellulose or starch applied thereto. Exemplary flavors include methyl cyclopentenolone vanillin ethyl vanillin inulin 4 parahydroxyphenyl 2 butanone gamma undecalactone 2 methoxy 4 vinylphenol 2 methoxy 4 methylphenol 5 ethyl 3 hydroxy 4 methyl 2 5H furanone methyl salicylate clary sage oil and sandalwood oil. Typically such types of flavor components are employed in amounts of about 0.2 percent to about 6.0 percent based on the total weight of the adhesive and flavor components.

The wrapping materials of the present invention also can be used in the manufacture of tobacco rods having more than one layer of circumscribing wrapping material such as the so called double wrap tobacco rods. That is the wrapping material of the present invention can be used as the inner wrap or the outer wrap of such double wrap tobacco rods. Exemplary cigarettes and exemplary components parameters and specifications thereof are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 220 930 to Gentry PCT WO 02 37990 and US Pat. Application 2002 0166563.

Wrapping materials of the present invention are useful for the manufacture of cigarettes designed to exhibit reduced ignition propensity. That is cigarettes incorporating certain wrapping materials of the present invention when placed on a flammable substrate tend to self extinguish before burning that substrate. Of particular interest are those cigarettes possessing tobacco rods manufactured using appropriate wrapping materials possessing bands composed of appropriate amounts of appropriate components so as to have the ability to meet the aforementioned cigarette extinction criteria.

The wrapping material that is further processed to provide the patterned wrapping material of the present invention can have a wide range of compositions and properties. The selection of a particular wrapping material will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of cigarette design and manufacture. Typical paper wrapping materials are manufactured from fibrous materials and optional filler materials to form so called base sheets. Wrapping materials of the present invention can be manufactured without significant modifications to the production techniques or processing equipment used to manufacture those wrapping materials.

Typical wrapping material base sheets suitable for use as the circumscribing wrappers of tobacco rods for cigarettes have basis weights that can vary. Typical dry basis weights of base sheets are at least about 15 g m2 and frequently are at least about 20 g m2 while typical dry basis weights do not exceed about 80 g m2 and frequently do not exceed about 60 g m2. Many preferred wrapping material base sheets have basis weights of less than 50 g m2 and even less than 40 g m2. Certain preferred paper wrapping material base sheets have basis weights between about 20 g m2 and about 30 g m2.

Typical wrapping material base sheets suitable for use as the circumscribing wrappers of tobacco rods for cigarettes have inherent porosities that can vary. Typical base sheets have inherent porosities that are at least about 5 CORESTA units usually are at least about 10 CORESTA units often are at least about 15 CORESTA units and frequently are at least about 20 CORESTA units. Typical base sheets have inherent porosities that are less than about 200 CORESTA units usually are less than about 150 CORESTA units often are less than about 85 CORESTA units and frequently are less than about 70 CORESTA units. A CORESTA unit is a measure of the linear air velocity that passes through a 1 cm2 area of wrapping material at a constant pressure of 1 centibar. See CORESTA Publication ISO TC0126 SC I N159E 1986 . The term inherent porosity refers to the porosity of that wrapping material itself to the flow of air. A particularly preferred paper wrapping material base sheet is composed of wood pulp and calcium carbonate and exhibits an inherent porosity of about 20 to about 50 CORESTA units.

Typical paper wrapping material base sheets suitable for use as the circumscribing wrappers of tobacco rods for cigarettes incorporate at least one type of fibrous material and can incorporate at least one filler material in amounts that can vary. Typical base sheets include about 55 to about 100 often about 65 to about 95 and frequently about 70 to about 90 percent fibrous material which most preferably is a cellulosic material and about 0 to about 45 often about 5 to about 35 and frequently about 10 to about 30 percent filler material which most preferably is an inorganic material based on the dry weight of that base sheet.

The wrapping material incorporates a fibrous material. The fibrous material can vary. Most preferably the fibrous material is a cellulosic material and the cellulosic material can be a lignocellulosic material. Exemplary cellulosic materials include flax fibers hardwood pulp softwood pulp hemp fibers esparto fibers kenaf fibers jute fibers and sisal fibers. Mixtures of two or more types of cellulosic materials can be employed. For example wrapping materials can incorporate mixtures of flax fibers and wood pulp. The fibers can be bleached or unbleached. Other fibrous materials that can be incorporated within wrapping materials include microfibers materials and fibrous synthetic cellulosic materials. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 779 631 to Durocher and U.S. Pat. No. 5 849 153 to Ishino. Representative fibrous materials and methods for making wrapping materials therefrom are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 2 754 207 to Schur et al and U.S. Pat. No. 5 474 095 to Allen et al. and PCT WO 01 48318.

The wrapping material normally incorporates a filler material. Preferably the filler material has the form of essentially water insoluble particles. Additionally the filler material normally incorporates inorganic components. Filler materials incorporating calcium salts are particularly preferred. One exemplary filler material has the form of calcium carbonate and the calcium carbonate most preferably is used in particulate form. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 805 644 to Hampl U.S. Pat. No. 5 161 551 to Sanders and U.S. Pat. No. 5 263 500 to Baldwin et al. and PCT WO 01 48 316. Other filler materials include agglomerated calcium carbonate particles calcium tartrate particles magnesium oxide particles magnesium hydroxide gels magnesium carbonate type materials clays diatomaceous earth materials titanium dioxide particles gamma alumina materials and calcium sulfate particles. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 049 449 to Allegrini U.S. Pat. No. 4 108 151 to Martin U.S. Pat. No. 4 231 377 to Cline U.S. Pat. No. 4 450 847 to Owens U.S. Pat. No. 4 779 631 to Durocher U.S. Pat. No. 4 915 118 to Kaufman U.S. Pat. No. 5 092 306 to Bokelman U.S. Pat. No. 5 109 876 to Hayden U.S. Pat. No. 5 699 811 to Paine U.S. Pat. No. 5 927 288 to Bensalem U.S. Pat. No. 5 979 461 to Bensalem and U.S. Pat. No. 6 138 684 to Yamazaki and European Pat. Application 357 359. Certain filler type materials that can be incorporated into the wrapping materials can have fibrous forms. For example components of the filler material can include materials such as glass fibers ceramic fibers carbon fibers and calcium sulfate fibers. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 2 998 012 to Lamm U.S. Pat. No. 4 433 679 to Cline and U.S. Pat. No. 5 103 844 to Hayden et al. PCT WO 01 41590 and European Pat. Application 1 084 629. Mixtures of filler materials can be used. For example filler material compositions can incorporate mixtures of calcium carbonate particles and precipitated magnesium hydroxide gel mixtures of calcium carbonate particles and calcium sulfate fibers or mixtures of calcium carbonate particles and magnesium carbonate particles.

There are various ways by which the various additive components can be added to or otherwise incorporated into the base sheet. Certain additives can be incorporated into the wrapping material as part of the paper manufacturing process associated with the production of that wrapping material. Alternatively additives can be incorporated into the wrapping material using size press techniques spraying techniques printing techniques or the like. Such techniques known as off line techniques are used to apply additives to wrapping materials after those wrapping materials have been manufactured. Various additives can be added to or otherwise incorporated into the wrapping material simultaneously or at different stages during or after the paper manufacturing process.

The base sheets can be treated further and those base sheets can be treated so as to impart a change to the overall physical characteristics thereof and or so as to introduce a change in the overall chemical compositions thereof. For example the base sheet can be electrostatically perforated. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 924 888 to Perfetti et al. The base sheet also can be embossed for example in order to provide texture to major surface thereof. Additives can be incorporated into the wrapping material for a variety of reasons. Representative additives and methods for incorporating those additives to wrapping materials are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 220 930 to Gentry which is incorporated herein by reference. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 168 884 to Baldwin et al. Certain components such as alkali metal salts can act a burn control additives. Representative salts include alkali metal succinates citrates acetates malates carbonates chlorides tartrates propionates nitrates and glycolates including sodium succinate potassium succinate sodium citrate potassium citrate sodium acetate potassium acetate sodium malate potassium malate sodium carbonate potassium carbonate sodium chloride potassium chloride sodium tartrate potassium tartrate sodium propionate potassium propionate sodium nitrate potassium nitrate sodium glycolate and potassium glycolate and other salts such as monoammonium phosphate. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 2 580 568 to Matthews U.S. Pat. No. 4 461 311 to Matthews U.S. Pat. No. 4 622 983 to Matthews U.S. Pat. No. 4 941 485 to Perfetti et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4 998 541 to Perfetti et al. and PCT WO 01 08514. Certain components such as metal citrates can act as ash conditioners or ash sealers. See for example European Pat. Application 1 084 630. Other representative components include organic and inorganic acids such as malic levulinic boric and lactic acids. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 230 131 to Simon. Other representative components include catalytic materials. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 2 755 207 to Frankenburg. Typically the amount of chemical additive does not exceed about 3 percent often does not exceed about 2 percent and usually does not exceed about 1 percent based on the dry weight of the wrapping material to which the chemical additive is applied. For certain wrapping materials the amount of certain additive salts such as burn chemicals such as potassium citrate and monoammonium phosphate preferably are in the range of about 0.5 to about 0.8 percent based on the dry weight of the wrapping material to which those additive salts are applied. Relatively high levels of additive salts can be used on certain types of wrapping materials printed with printed regions that are very effective at causing extinction of cigarettes manufactured from those wrapping materials. Exemplary flax containing cigarette paper wrapping materials having relatively high levels of chemical additives have been available as Grade Names 512 525 527 540 605 and 664 from Schweitzer Mauduit International. Exemplary wood pulp containing cigarette paper wrapping materials having relatively high levels of chemical additives have been available as Grade Names 406 and 419 from Schweitzer Mauduit International.

Flavoring agents and or flavor and aroma precursors e.g. vanillin glucoside and or ethyl vanillin glucoside also can be incorporated into the paper wrapping material. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 804 002 to Herron and U.S. Pat. No. 4 941 486 to Dube et al. Flavoring agents also can be printed onto cigarette papers. See for example the types of flavoring agents used in cigarette manufacture that are set forth in Gutcho Tobacco Flavoring Substances and Methods Noyes Data Corp. 1972 and Leffingwell et al. Tobacco Flavoring for Smoking Products 1972 .

Films can be applied to the paper. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 889 145 to Adams U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 675 to Milford et al. and PCT WO 02 43513 and PCT WO 02 055294. Catalytic materials can be incorporated into the paper. See for example PCT WO 02 435134.

Typical paper wrapping materials that can be used in carrying out the present invention are manufactured under specifications directed toward the production of a wrapping material having an overall generally consistent composition and physical parameters. For those types of wrapping materials the composition and parameters thereof preferably are consistent when considered over regions of each of the major surfaces of those materials. However typical wrapping materials tend to have a two sided nature and thus there can be changes in the composition and certain physical parameters of those materials from one major surface to the other.

Though less preferred the wrapping material can be manufactured using a paper making process adapted to provide a base web comprising multiple layers of cellulosic material. See U.S. Pat. No. 5 143 098 to Rogers et al.

Much less preferred paper wrapping materials can have compositions and or properties that differ over different regions of each of their major surfaces. The wrapping material can have regions of increased or decreased porosity provided by control of the composition of that material such as by controlling the amount or type of the filler. The wrapping material can have regions of increased or decreased air permeability provided by embossing or perforating that material. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 4 945 932 to Mentzel et al. The wrapping material can have regions e.g. pre determined regions such as bands treated with additives such as certain of the aforementioned salts. For wrapping materials having compositions and or properties that differ over regions of their major surfaces alignment and registration of the printed bands with patterned regions of the wrapping materials offers manufacturing complications.

Paper wrapping materials suitable for use in carrying out the present invention are commercially available. Representative cigarette paper wrapping materials have been available as Ref. Nos. 419 454 456 460 and 473 Ecusta Corp. Ref. Nos.

Exemplary wood pulp containing cigarette paper wrapping materials have been available as Grade Names 404 416 422 453 454 456 465 466 and 468 from Schweitzer Mauduit International.

The number of layers of coatings that are applied to the wrapping material can vary. One coating layer can be applied to either or both sides of the paper. More than one coating layer can be applied to either or both sides of the paper. For wrapping materials intended to be used for the manufacture of cigarettes designed to meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria it often is desirable to apply at least two layers and most preferably at least three layers of printing formulation to those wrapping materials.

The composition of the coating formulation can vary. Generally the composition of the coating is determined by the ingredients of the coating formulation. Preferably the coating formulation has an overall composition and is applied in a manner and in an amount such that the physical integrity of the wrapping material is not adversely affected when individual layers of coating formulation are applied to the wrapping material. It also is desirable that components of the coating formulation not introduce undesirable sensory characteristics to the smoke generated by a smoke article incorporating a wrapping material treated with that coating formulation. Thus suitable combinations of various components can act to reduce the effect of coatings on sensory characteristics of smoke generated by the smoking article during use.

Examples of coating formulations are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4 889 145 to Adams and U.S. Pat. No. 5 060 675 to Milford et al. PCT WO 02 043513 PCT WO 02 055294 and European Pat. Application 1 234 514. Other coating formulations are described herein.

The coating formulation most preferably includes a film forming agent. The film forming agent most preferably is a polymeric material or resin. Exemplary film forming agents include alginates e.g. sodium alginate or ammonium alginate including those alginates available as Kelcosol from Kelco pectins e.g. including those available as TIC Pretested HM from TIC Gums derivatives of cellulose e.g. nitrocellulose hydroxy ethylcellulose ethylcellulose carboxymethylcellulose and cellulose acetate propionate ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers guar gum e.g. including Type M Type MM Type MM high viscosity from Frutarom and Ticagel from TIC Gums xanthan gum e.g. including Keltrol from Kelco starch e.g. corn starch rice starch and dextrin modified starch e.g. oxidized tapioca starch and oxidized corn starch polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl alcohol. Exemplary film forming agents are available as Klucel hydroxypropylcellulose HPC Aqualon sodium carboxymethylcellulose CMC Natrosol hydroxyethylcellulose HEC and Aqualon ethylcellulose EC from Hercules Incorporated and Walocel nitrocellulose and Walsroder nitrocellulose from Bayer AG. Suitable combinations of various film forming agents also can be employed. Exemplary blends include blends of ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and polyvinyl alcohol blends of ethylcellulose and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer blends of nitrocellulose and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and blends of ethylcellulose and nitrocellulose. The aforementioned blends of film forming agents most preferably those that have hydrophobic characters are suitable for primary or first layer coatings for multi layered coatings.

The solvent or liquid carrier for the coating formulation can vary. The solvent can be a liquid having an aqueous character and can include relatively pure water. An aqueous liquid is a suitable solvent or carrier for film forming agents such as water based emulsions starch based materials sodium carboxymethylcellulose ammonium alginate guar gum xanthan gum pectins polyvinyl alcohol and hydroxyethylcellulose. Starch based materials are film forming agents that are composed of starch or components derived from starch. The solvent also can be a non aqueous solvent. A non aqueous solvent is a suitable solvent for film forming agents such as ethylcellulose nitrocellulose polyvinyl acetate and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers. Exemplary non aqueous solvents are organic liquids such as ethanol n propyl alcohol iso propyl alcohol ethyl acetate n propyl acetate iso propyl acetate toluene and the like. Mixtures of organic solvents can be employed. Mixtures of organic and aqueous liquids e.g. mixtures of water and ethanol also can be employed. Solvents that do not adversely affect the quality of the wrapping material e.g. by causing swelling of the fibers of the wrapping material by causing puckering of the wrapping material or by causing wrinkling of the wrapping material are particularly preferred. Hydrophobic non aqueous solvents typically have less of a tendency to adversely affect the physical nature of the wrapping material than do aqueous solvents and hence often are the preferred solvents for printing formulations that are applied directly to the surface of a wrapping material e.g. as a first or bottom layer of a multi layer pattern .

Generally the selection of solvent depends upon the nature of the film forming polymeric material and the particular polymeric material that is selected readily dissolves i.e. is soluble or is highly dispersible in a highly preferred solvent. Although not all components of the coating formulation are soluble in the liquid carrier it is most preferable that the film forming polymeric material be soluble or at least highly dispersible in that liquid. By soluble in referring to the components of the coating formulation with respect to the liquid solvent is meant that the components for a thermodynamically stable mixture when combined with the solvent have a significant ability to dissolve in that solvent and do not form precipitates to any significant degree when present in that solvent.

Mixtures of non aqueous solvents can be used and those mixtures can vary. A representative mixture is a combination of iso propyl alcohol and ethyl acetate e.g. about 5 percent to about 25 percent preferably about 15 percent to about 20 percent iso propyl alcohol and 75 percent to about 95 percent preferably about 80 to about 85 percent ethyl acetate by weight which is a suitable solvent for film forming agents such as ethylcellulose and nitrocellulose. Another representative mixture is a combination of n propyl alcohol and n propyl acetate e.g. about 15 percent to about 25 percent n propyl alcohol and about 75 percent to about 85 percent n propyl acetate by weight which is a suitable solvent for film forming agents such as ethylcellulose and nitrocellulose. Another representative mixtures is toluene and n propyl alcohol e.g. about 90 percent to about 95 percent toluene and about 5 percent to about 10 percent n propyl alcohol by weight which is a suitable solvent mixtures for film forming agents such as ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers.

The coating formulation also can include a filler material. Exemplary filler materials can be the essentially water insoluble types of filler materials previous described. Preferred filler materials have a finely divided e.g. particulate form. Typical fillers are those that have particle sizes that are less than about 3 microns in diameter. Typical particle sizes of suitable fillers range from about 0.3 micron to 2 microns in diameter. The filler materials can have a variety of shapes. Exemplary filler materials are those that are composed of inorganic materials including metal particles and filings calcium carbonate e.g. precipitated type fillers including those having a prismatic form calcium phosphate clays e.g. attapulgite clay talc aluminum oxide mica magnesium oxide calcium sulfate magnesium carbonate magnesium hydroxide aluminum oxide and titanium dioxide. See for example the types of filler materials set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 5 878 753 to Peterson et al. Representative calcium carbonate fillers are those available as Albacar PCC Albafil PCC Albaglos PCC Opacarb PCC Jetcoat PCC and Calopake F PCC from Specialty Minerals Inc. Exemplary filler materials also can be composed of organic materials including starches modified starches and flours e.g. rice flour particles of polyvinyl alcohol particles of tobacco e.g. tobacco dust and other like materials. The filler material also can be fibrous cellulosic materials. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 417 228 to Baldwin et al. Although less preferred alternate fillers can include carbon based materials e.g. graphite type materials carbon fiber materials and ceramics metallic materials e.g. particles of iron and the like. The filler material can be a water soluble salt e.g. an alkali metal chloride or citrate salt when a non aqueous solvent is used as the solvent for film forming materials such as ethylcellulose and nitrocellulose.

The coating formulations can incorporate other ingredients in addition to the aforementioned coating materials. Those ingredients can be dispersed or suspended within the coating formulation. Those other ingredients can be employed in order to provide specific properties or characteristics to the wrapping material. Those ingredients can be preservatives e.g. potassium sorbate humectants e.g. ethylene glycol and propylene glycol pigments dyes burn promoters and enhancers burn retardants and inhibitors plasticers e.g. dibutyl phthalate polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol and triacetin sizing agents syrups e.g. high fructose corn syrup flavoring agents e.g ethyl vanillin and caryophyllene oxide sugars e.g. rhamnose flavor precursors hydrate materials such as metal hydrates e.g. borax magnesium sulfate decahydrate magnesium sulfate heptahydrate sodium silicate pentahydrate and sodium sulfate decahydrate viscosity reducing agents e.g. urea waxes oils tackifying resins and the like. Certain of those ingredients are soluble in the solvent of the coating formulation e.g. certain salts acids and bases are soluble in solvents such as water . Certain of those ingredients are insoluble in the solvent of the coating formulation e.g. particles of metallic materials are insoluble in most of the solvents used for coating formulations .

The coating formulation typically has a liquid form and is applied to the wrapping material in a liquid form. Depending upon the actual ingredients that are combined with the solvent the coating formulation has the form of a liquid an emulsion e.g. a water based emulsion or a liquid having solid materials dispersed therein. Generally the film forming agent is dissolved or dispersed in a suitable solvent to form the coating formulation. Certain other optional ingredients also are dissolved dispersed or suspended in that formulation. Additionally optional filler material also is dispersed within that formulation. Preferably the filler material is essentially insoluble and essentially chemically non reactive with the solvent at least at those conditions at which the formulation is employed.

The relative amounts of the various components of the coating formulation can vary. Typically the coating formulation includes at least about 30 percent solvent usually at least about 40 percent solvent and often at least about 50 percent solvent based on the total weight of that formulation. Typically the amount of solvent within the coating formulation does not exceed about 99 percent usually does not exceed about 95 percent and often does not exceed about 90 percent based on the total weight of that formulation. Most preferably the coating formulation includes at least about 0.5 percent film forming agent usually at least about 1 percent film forming agent and often at least about 2 percent film forming agent based on the total weight of that formulation. Typically the amount of film forming agent within the coating formulation does not exceed about 30 percent usually does not exceed about 20 percent and often does not exceed about 10 percent based on the total weight of that formulation. Typically the coating formulation includes at least about 3 percent of the optional filler material usually at least about 5 percent filler material and often at least about 10 percent filler material based on the total weight of that formulation. Typically the amount of optional filler material within the coating formulation does not exceed about 35 percent usually does not exceed about 30 percent and often does not exceed about 25 percent based on the total weight of that formulation.

The amounts of other optional components of the coating formulation can vary. The amount of plasticizer often ranges from about 0.5 percent to about 5 percent preferably about 2 to about 3 percent based on the total weight of the formulation. The amount of humectant often ranges from about 1 percent to about 5 percent preferably about 2 to about 3 percent based on the total weight of the formulation. The amount of wetting agent often ranges from about 0.5 percent to about 2 percent preferably about 0.8 to about 1 percent based on the total weight of the formulation. The amount of preservative often ranges from about 0.01 percent to about 0.3 percent preferably about 0.5 percent based on the total weight of the formulation. The amount of burn chemical often ranges from about 1 percent to about 15 percent preferably about 5 to about 10 percent based on the total weight of the formulation. The amount of viscosity reducing agent often ranges from about 1 percent to about 10 percent preferably about 2 percent to about 6 percent based on the total weight of the formulation. The amount of metal hydrate often ranges from about 3 percent usually at least about 5 percent and often at least about 10 percent based on the total weight of that formulation but the amount of metal hydrate usually does not exceed about 35 percent often does not exceed about 30 percent and frequently does not exceed about 25 percent based on the total weight of that formulation.

Other components of coating formulation can include those materials that allow for the use of automated equipment to ensure proper registry or alignment of the various layers of the coating. Optical brighteners provide the ability to accurately and precisely identify the locations of printed layers and hence allow for proper alignment and registry of various printed layers. Those materials often are fluorescent materials that are referred to as optical brighteners. Exemplary optical brighteners include thiophenedyl benzoxazoles such as those commercially available as Uvitex OB from Ciba Specialty Chemicals and those optical brighteners available as Eccobrite RB 6 and Eccowhiter AC 10 from Eastern Color Chemical Co. The amount of optical brightener employed is an amount sufficient to allow the various layers to be identified for registration and that amount typically makes up a very small fraction of the printing formulation. Typically the amount of optical brightener used comprises about 0.01 to about 0.2 weight percent of the printing formulation. Preferred optical brighteners are those that remain within the regions of the wrapping material to which they are applied and particularly in those regions upon which electromagnetic detection systems that are used to control layer registry are focused. Preferred optical brighteners are those that do smear across or rub off of the wrapping material at least prior to the time that the optical brightener is detected by the relevant electromagnetic detection system.

Flavoring agents can be incorporated into the printing formulations. The printing formulations incorporating flavoring agents can be applied over the whole surface of the wrapping material over portions of the surface of the wrapping material or as some or all of the layers of the printed bands. Preferably the flavoring agents exhibit sensory characteristics that can be described as having notes that are sweet woody fruity or some combination thereof. The flavoring agents preferably are employed in amounts that depend upon their individual detection thresholds. Typically the flavoring agents are employed in sufficient amounts so as to mask or ameliorate the off tastes and malodors associated with burning paper. Combinations of flavoring agents e.g. a flavor package can be employed in order to provide desired overall sensory characteristics to smoke generated from the smoking articles incorporating those flavoring agents. Most preferably those flavoring agents are employed in amounts and manners so that the sensory characteristics of those flavoring agents are hardly detectable and those flavoring agents do not adversely affect the overall sensory characteristics of smoking article into which they are incorporated. Preferred flavoring agents can be incorporated into printing formulations have low vapor pressures do not have a tendency to migrate or evaporate under normal ambient conditions and are stable under the processing conditions experienced by wrapping materials of the present invention. Exemplary flavoring agents that provide sweet notes include ethyl vanillin vanillin inulin a fructose oligomer heliotropin methylcyclopentenolone and those flavoring agents typically are employed in amounts of 0.001 to about 0.01 percent based on the total weight of the printing formulation into which they are incorporated. An exemplary flavoring agent that provides woody notes includes caryophyllene oxide and that flavoring agent typically is employed in amounts of 0.2 to about 0.6 percent based on the total weight of the printing formulation into which it is incorporated. Exemplary flavoring agents that provide fruity notes include ketones such as 4 hydroxphenyl 2 butanone and lactones such as gamma dodecalactone and those flavoring agents typically are employed in amounts of 0.001 to about 0.1 percent based on the total weight of the printing formulation into which they are incorporated.

Certain layers can be applied to the wrapping material in the form of a coating formulation that is in a so called solid polymer form. That is film forming materials such as ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers and certain starches can be mixed with other components of the coating formation and applied to the wrapping material without the necessity of dissolving those film forming materials in a suitable solvent. Typically solid polymer coating formulations are applied at elevated temperatures relative to ambient temperature and the viscosities of the film forming materials of those heated coating formulations typically are in the range of about 100 centipoises to about 10 000 centipoises frequently about 1 000 centipoises to about 5 000 centipoises.

In most applications it is desirable for the wrapping materials to have patterns applied thereto in a manner such that those patterns do not adversely affect the appearance of the cigarette manufactured using those wrapping materials. In certain applications such as when patterns that are applied to white cigarette papers are provided from layers that are colorless or slightly colored in nature those patterns can be visible to the smoker of cigarettes manufactured from those wrapping materials even if the pattern is applied to the major surface of that wrapping material that provides the inside surface of the cigarette wrapping material i.e. the surface that contacts the smokable filler . For this reason certain components that provide whitening characteristics to those layers and hence those patterns can be incorporated into coating formulations. In one respect fillers such as calcium carbonate or titanium dioxide can be incorporated into coating formulations to provide a white appearance to the layers provided by those coating formulations. Coating formulations also can incorporate components that cloud those formulations and hence dry to yield opaque or hazy appearances. For example a coating formulation incorporating a non aqueous solvent that is not miscible in water e.g. iso propyl acetate and a suitable film forming polymeric material soluble in that solvent e.g. ethylcellulose can be provided with a white character and hence rended less visible when applied to a white cigarette paper wrapping material particularly when applied as a first or bottom layer of a multi layered pattern by incorporating a small amount of water e.g. about 2 percent based on the weight of the solvent of that coating formulation into that coating formulation. One way to render printed patterns less visible on white cigarette paper wrapping materials involves employing a coating formulation incorporating a non aqueous solvent that is not miscible with water e.g. iso propyl acetate a suitable film forming polymer e.g. ethylcellulose and either a ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer or a water based emulsion incorporating ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer particularly when that coating formulation is applied as a first or bottom layer of a multi layered pattern. Typically such a mixture incorporates about 10 percent to about 20 percent preferably about 15 percent ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and about 80 percent to about 90 percent preferably about 85 percent ethylcellulose based on the total weight of those components.

Preferably film forming agents are polymeric materials of relatively low molecular weight in order to ensure easy application thereof to the wrapping material. Preferred coating formulations employing solvents have viscosities such that those formulations can be efficiently and effectively applied to the wrapping materials. Typical coating formulations have viscosities of about 20 centipoises to about 10 000 centipoises with about 20 centipoises to about 300 centipoises being preferred.

The amount of coating formulation that is applied to the paper wrapping material can vary. Typically coating of the wrapping material provides a printed wrapping material having an overall dry basis weight i.e. the basis weight of the whole wrapping material including coated and uncoated regions of at least about 1.05 times often at least about 1.1 times and frequently at least about 1.2 times that of the dry basis weight of that wrapping material prior to the application of coating thereto. Typically coating of the wrapping material provides a printed paper having an overall dry basis weight of not more about 1.4 times and often not more than about 1.3 times that of the dry basis weight of the wrapping material that has the coating applied thereto. Typical overall dry basis weights of those wrapping materials are about 20 g m2 to about 40 g m2 preferably about 25 g m2 to about 35 g m2. For example a paper wrapping material having a dry basis weight of about 25 g m2 can be coated in accordance with the present invention to have a resulting overall dry basis weight of about 26.5 g m2 to about 35 g m2 and often about 28 g m2 to about 32 g m2.

The dry weights of the printed regions of wrapping material of the present invention can vary. For wrapping materials that are used for the manufacture of cigarettes designed to meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria it is desirable that the wrapping materials have sufficient coating formulation applied thereto to in the form of appropriately shaped and spaced bands in order that the dry weight of printed material applied to those wrapping materials totals at least about 3 pounds ream often at least about 4 pounds ream and sometimes at least about 6 pounds ream while the total dry weight of that printed material normally does not exceed about 10 pounds ream. For those types of wrapping materials possessing multi layered bands the dry weight of individual layers of printed material applied to those wrapping materials is at least about 0.25 pounds ream to about 0.5 pounds ream or more.

Typical coated regions of paper wrapping materials of the present invention that are suitable for use as the circumscribing wrappers of tobacco rods for cigarettes have inherent porosities that can vary. Typically the inherent porosities of the coated regions of the wrapping materials are less than about 8.5 CORESTA units usually are less than about 8 CORESTA units often are less than about 7 CORESTA units and frequently are less than about 6 CORESTA units. Typically the inherent porosities of the coated regions of the wrapping materials are at least about 0.1 CORESTA unit usually are at least about 0.5 CORESTA unit often are at least about 1 CORESTA unit. Preferably the inherent porosities of the coated regions of the wrapping materials particularly those wrapping materials that are used for the manufacture of cigarettes designed to meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria are between about 0.1 CORESTA unit and about 4 CORESTA units.

Preferably the wrapping materials of the present invention are used for the manufacture of tobacco rods without further chemical or physical treatment. However although not preferred those materials can be subjected to further processing. Those wrapping materials can be perforated e.g. using electrostatic perforation techniques or embossed. Examples of printed wrapping materials are designated as Ref. No. 749 by Ecusta which is a printed paper e.g. printed with layers of a coating formulation incorporating ethylcellulose and calcium carbonate having a base paper inherent porosity of about 46 CORESTA units which is electrostatically perforated to a net porosity of about 115 CORESTA units and Ref. No. 879 by Ecusta which is a printed paper e.g. printed with layers of a coating formulation incorporating ethylcellulose and calcium carbonate having a base paper inherent porosity of about 33 CORESTA units which is electrostatically performated to a net porosity of about 75 CORESTA units. Perforation of the wrapping material can be carried out over the entire major surface of the wrapping material or solely over the unprinted regions of that wrapping material. Additionally those wrapping materials can have further additives applied thereto e.g. water soluble salts can be applied as an aqueous solution using a size press particularly for wrapping materials that possess films formed from film forming agents such as ethylcellulose .

The paper wrapping material of the present invention can have can be coated in patterns having predetermined shapes. The coating can have the form of bands cross directional lines or bands including those that are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the wrapping material stripes grids longitudinally extending lines circles hollow circles dots ovals checks spirals swirls helical bands diagonally crossing lines or bands triangles hexagonals honeycombs ladder type shapes zig zag shaped stripes or bands sinusoidal shaped stripes or bands square wave shaped stripes or bands patterns composed of printed regions that are generally C or U shaped patterns composed of printed regions that are generally E shaped patterns composed of printed regions that are generally S shaped patterns composed of printed regions that are generally T shaped patterns composed of printed regions that are generally V shaped patterns composed of printed regions that are generally W shaped patterns composed of printed regions that are generally X shaped patterns composed of printed regions that are generally Z shaped or other desired shapes. Combinations of the foregoing shapes also can used to provide the printing pattern. Printing patterns incorporating certain of the foregoing shapes can be employed as the discontinuous layers of certain multi layered printed patterns such as multi layered bands.

The relative sizes or dimensions of the various shapes and designs can be selected as desired. For example shapes of coated regions compositions of the coating formulations or amounts or concentrations of coating materials can change over the length of the wrapping material. The relative positioning of the printed regions can be selected as desired. For example wrapping materials that are used for the production of cigarettes designed to meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria the pattern most preferably has the form of spaced continuous bands that are aligned transversely or cross directionally to the longitudinal axis of the wrapping material. However cigarettes can be manufactured from wrapping materials possessing discontinuous bands positioned in a spaced apart relationship. For wrapping materials of those cigarettes it is most preferred that discontinuous bands e.g. bands that are composed of a pattern such as a series of dots grids or stripes cover at least about 70 percent of the surface of the band area or region of the wrapping material.

Preferred wrapping materials possess coatings in the form of bands that extend across the wrapping material generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the wrapping material. The widths of the individual bands can vary as well as the spacings between those bands. Typically those bands have widths of at least about 0.5 mm usually at least about 1 mm frequently at least about 2 mm and most preferably at least about 3 mm. Typically those bands have widths of up to about 8 mm usually up to about 7 mm. Preferred bands have widths of about 4 mm to about 7 mm. Such bands can be spaced apart such that the spacing between the bands is at least about 10 mm often at least about 15 mm frequently at least about 20 mm often at least about 25 mm in certain instances at least about 30 mm and on occasion at least about 35 mm but such spacing usually does not exceed about 50 mm.

Preferred wrapping materials possessing coatings in the form of bands have those coatings applied in a layered form. That is a layer of coating is applied to the major surface of the wrapping material and successive layers are applied to the wrapping material over all or part of each successive layer. The composition of each layer can be the same or the compositions of the various layers can be different from one another. In certain circumstances a hydrophobic coating is applied as the first layer to the major surface of the wrapping material either as a band layer a coated region or as a layer that fully covers the surface of the wrapping material. As such a first coating is deposited directly onto the substrate and that coating can be effective to reduce the water absorption capabilities of that substrate.

There are several factors that determine a specific coating pattern for a wrapping material of the present invention. It is desirable that the components of the coating formulations applied to wrapping materials not adversely affect to any significant degree i the appearance of cigarettes manufactured from those wrapping materials ii the nature or quality of the smoke generated by those cigarettes iii the desirable burn characteristics of those cigarettes or iv the desirable performance characteristics of those cigarettes. It also is desirable that wrapping materials having coating formulations applied thereto not introduce undesirable off taste or otherwise adversely affect the sensory characteristics of the smoke generated by cigarettes manufactured using those wrapping materials. In addition preferred cigarettes of the present invention do not have a tendency to undergo premature extinction such as when lit cigarettes are held in the smoker s hand or when placed in an ashtray for a brief period of time.

Cigarettes designed to meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria can be produced from wrapping materials of the present invention. Banded regions on a wrapping material are produced using film forming materials that are effective in reducing the inherent porosity of the wrapping material in those regions. Film forming materials and fillers applied to the wrapping material in those banded regions are effective in increasing the weight of the wrapping material in those regions. Filler materials that are applied to the wrapping material in those banded regions are effective in decreasing the burn rate of the wrapping materials in those regions. Typically when wrapping materials of relatively high inherent porosity are used to manufacture cigarettes those wrapping materials possess relatively high weight bands that introduce a relatively low inherent porosity to the banded regions. Film forming materials have a tendency to reduce the porosity of the wrapping material whether or not those materials are used in conjunction with fillers. However coatings that combine porosity reduction with added coating weight to wrapping materials also are effective in facilitating extinction of cigarettes manufactured from those wrapping materials. Low porosity in selected regions of a wrapping material tends to cause a lit cigarette to extinguish due to the decrease in access to oxygen for combustion for the smokable material within that wrapping material. Increased weight of the wrapping material also tends to cause lit cigarette incorporating that wrapping material to extinguish.

For certain cigarette paper wrapping materials printed with bands it often is desirable to provide bands composed of i about 4 layers or more when the inherent porosity of the wrapping material is greater than about 60 CORESTA units ii about 3 to about 4 layers when the inherent porosity of the wrapping material is between about 40 and about 60 CORESTA units and iii about 2 to about 3 layers when the inherent porosity of the wrapping material is between about 15 and about 40 CORESTA units. Preferred wrapping materials having bands composed of two layers typically have base sheet inherent porosities in the range of about 15 to about 30 CORESTA units and preferred wrapping materials having bands composed of three layers typically have base sheet inherent porosities in the range of about 20 to about 60 CORESTA units. For each of the foregoing the ability to provide cigarettes that meet certain cigarette extinction test criteria can be enhanced by incorporating an effective amount of suitable filler into at least one of the layers that make up each band. That is as the inherent porosity of the wrapping material increases it also is desirable to i select a film forming material so as to cause a decrease the inherent porosity of the coated region of the wrapping material and or ii provide a coating that provides a relatively large amount of added weight to the coated region of the wrapping material.

Paper wrapping materials of the present invention are useful as components of smoking articles such as cigarettes. Preferably one layer of the wrapping material of the present invention is used as the wrapping material circumscribing the smokable material and thereby forming the tobacco rod of a cigarette. In one regard it is preferable that the wrapping material possesses the printed regions located on the wire side thereof and the wire side of that wrapping material forms the inner surface of the circumscribing wrapping material of the tobacco rod. In another regard it is preferable that the wrapping material possesses the printed regions located on the felt side thereof as coating on the felt side of that wrapping material provides for a relatively great decrease in the porosity of that wrapping material for a relatively small amount of coating. The terms wire side and felt side in referring to the major surfaces of paper sheet are readily understood as terms of art to those skilled in the art of paper manufacture.

Wrapping materials of the present invention can be produced in such a manner so as to avoid the occurrence of blocking. That is when a previously manufactured paper wrapping material is printed using an offline process with a coating or layers of coatings and the resulting printed wrapping material is rewound into a roll for later manufacture of cigarettes the coated wrapping material can have a tendency to stick or adhere to itself when that wrapping material is rewound. As a result when the roll of printed wrapping material is unwound that material can readily break or exhibit erratic payout. Problems associated with blocking also can be exacerbated as a result of the use of i coatings that are sticky or tacky ii coatings that are wet and applied during a high speed printing operation thus resulting is poor drying and iii paper wrapping materials that are of relatively low tensile strengths such as is the case of wrapping materials of relatively high inherent porosities. Wrapping materials of the present invention that is those that have coatings applied in the form of layers can be suitably dried. Thus the undesirable effects associated with blocking can be minimized and preferably avoided particularly when top layers having anti blocking properties are dried quickly to consistencies that are non tacky. Preferred film forming materials for the top layers of multi layered printed patterns include ethylcellulose polyvinyl acetate nitrocellulose cellulose acetate propionate polyvinyl alcohol and ethylene vinyl acetate copolymers of which ethylcellulose is most preferred. The top anti blocking layers provided by certain types of film forming materials can be used in conjunction with other layers of film forming materials that are used to reduce the inherent porosity of the wrapping material and provide an increase in weight to the wrapping material.

The following examples are provided in order to further illustrate various aspects of the invention but should not be construed as limiting the scope thereof. Unless otherwise noted all parts and percentages are by weight.

With reference to there are shown various enlarged cross sectional views of cigarette paper wrapping materials that are examples representative of the present invention. Each exemplary wrapping material possesses a base sheet. A typical base sheet or base web is composed of a mixture of materials such as cellulosic fiber and inorganic filler and an exemplary base web can be composed of materials such as wood pulp and calcium carbonate. An exemplary base sheet also can incorporate a small amounts i.e. less than about 3 percent of the base web of burn chemical such as potassium citrate or potassium phosphate but the base sheet also can be absent of added burn chemical.

At least a portion of the base sheet is coated with at least one coating formulation on at least one of its two major surfaces in predetermined regions so as to provide wrapping material having a plurality of coating layers. The coatings are applied to either side or both sides of the wrapping material base sheet e.g. to the felt side of the paper to the wire side of the paper or to both the felt and wire sides of the paper . The printed patterns for the various substrates normally have the form of series of recurring bands and those bands preferably are printed in the form of various layers. Most preferably the coatings are applied to the major surface known as the wire side of the paper. Most preferably the bands are printed onto the base sheet using gravure printing techniques.

The exemplary embodiments of the present invention that are described with reference to are illustrated in such a manner so that the various layers appear as a distinct series of layers or as coatings having the form of discrete layers. In addition the exemplary embodiments are illustrated in such a manner that the various layers have distinct edges or corners. However as a practical matter the application of discrete layers does not necessarily result in a printed coating exhibiting the appearance of discrete layers when viewed cross sectionally. That is the layers though most preferably applied as discrete layers e.g. as a coating resembling a laminate do not necessarily maintain their identity as individual or independent layers. In particular a coating formulation applied over a previously applied layer of printed material can undergo some mixing or commingling with that printed material prior to the time that the coating formulation is dried after application. Thus particularly for multi layered patterns printed using several applications of the identical coating formulation the resulting pattern may not resemble a laminated structure when viewed cross sectionally. For example the liquid form of a printing formulation can cause components of that formulation to soak into the wrapping material and layers upon which that formulation is applied and removal of that solvent by evaporation can cause a change in shape of the coating formulation between the time of application and the time of drying. The thickness of a multi layered band can vary and the band can be very thin as at least a portion of the coating can migrate into the wrapping material from the surface of the wrapping material to which the printing formulation is applied. Furthermore the edges and corners of printed layers and patterns may have a rounded appearance due to factors such as bleed out that occur during conventional printing processes involving the printing of paper.

The exemplary embodiments of the present invention that are described with reference to are illustrated in such a manner that the various bands are symmetrical about a cross sectional axis of the wrapping material. Additionally the bands are equally spaced from one another. This provides the ability for the wrapping material so provided to be used to manufacture cigarettes in such a manner that the wrapping material can be produce nearly identical smokable rods that can be burned in either direction along the longitudinal axis of that wrapping material.

The exemplary embodiments of the coated wrapping materials of the present invention that are described with reference to are illustrated in such a manner so that the various layers can be positioned on the inside region of a tobacco rod of a cigarette manufactured from those wrapping materials or less preferably on the outside region of a tobacco rod of a cigarette manufactured from those wrapping materials.
