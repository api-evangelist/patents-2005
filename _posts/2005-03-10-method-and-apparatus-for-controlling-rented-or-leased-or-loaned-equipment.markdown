The entire disclosures of all of the above patent applications are incorporated herein by reference at least for US purposes.

The invention disclosed therein has applicability to the renting leasing and or loaning etc. of electronic equipment such as a washing machine office equipment industrial or medical equipment vending or article dispensing equipment and many other types of equipment operable and or controllable by a computer wherein the one entity wishes to have some control over another entity that has physical possession and or control of the equipment.

The invention is especially useful for such equipment where one entity has an interest in controlling in conjunction with at least one other interested entity the usage of an equipment which is in the physical control and or possession custody etc. of a second entity.

Although detailed examples of the present invention will be described below in the environment of improvements in apparatus and methods involving the vending of goods from a vending apparatus as noted above and will be noted at places below the invention is applicable more broadly to equipment control between various parties interested in the equipment.

Conventional vending machines are sized to fit into a space measuring about 4 4 6 . These vending machines typically include a storage area in which various goods are located and a dispensing means to move the goods from the storage area to an exit port. When a user of the vending machine i.e. a purchaser of goods wishes to purchase goods he or she inserts money into the vending machine and is given an opportunity to select a particular item from the plurality of goods stored within the vending machine. Sometimes this selection process involves the user viewing the goods within the storage area of the vending machine by way of some transparent window or the like. Alternatively some vending machines do not permit the user to view the goods stored within the machine the selectable goods being understood by way of visible indicia on the exterior of the vending machine e.g. branding indicia advertising indicia etc. in association with selection indicia and or means. In either case the user usually enters his or her selection by way of a keypad selection buttons etc. In response to the user s selection the dispensing means of the vending machine moves the selected goods from the storage area to the exit port of the vending machine such that the user may obtain the goods.

The above discussion relates to how a user obtains goods from a conventional vending machine. The purchase installation and maintenance of a conventional vending machine and the distribution of revenue from that vending machine will now be discussed. Using conventional techniques an operator of a vending machine purchases the vending machine from a manufacturer of vending machines. The operator may obtain a loan from a third party e.g. a bank using the vending machine to collateralize the loan. In the alternative the operator can lease the vending machine from a lessor of capital equipment for some agreed upon price schedule usually involving payment on a monthly quarterly yearly etc. basis .

Irrespective of how the vending machine is purchased or leased the operator takes possession of the vending machine and installs the vending machine at a particular location for example within a business office at a gas station at an airport at a tavern etc. Placing the vending machine at the particular location may require that the operator enter into an agreement with the owner of the real property or his or her representative on which the vending machine is disposed. Of course when the operator owns the property on which the vending machine is located no separate agreement need be obtained. Typically the agreement between the operator and the owner of the real property requires the operator to make periodic payments to the owner of the real property for example on a monthly quarterly yearly etc. basis.

The operator is typically responsible for maintaining the vending machine after it is installed. This maintenance typically includes the purchasing of goods from a seller of goods stocking the vending machine with the goods and collecting revenue from the vending machine. The seller of goods is typically a goods manufacturer or distributor for example a food and or beverage company a candy company and ice cream company etc. The operator usually enters into an agreement with the seller of goods that dictates the quantity and price of the goods that the operator may purchase from the seller of goods. The agreement may also prescribe other factors such as how the goods are displayed within the vending machine e.g. when the vending machine includes a transparent window through which the purchaser may view the goods . It is noted that the operator may enter into agreements with a plurality of sellers of goods to obtain stock for a given vending machine such that different types and or brands of goods may be stocked in a given vending machine.

As mentioned above the operator typically collects revenue from the vending machine i.e. the money deposited in the vending machine by purchasers of goods . This is usually done at the time that the vending machine is stocked with goods such as on a daily weekly bi weekly monthly etc. basis. The operator typically uses portions of the revenue to pay the manufacturer of vending machines the lessor of capital equipment the bank e.g. for the purchase of the vending machine the owner of the real property on which the vending machine is disposed e.g. for rental of the real property and or the seller of goods e.g. for purchasing previous or future goods to stock the vending machine .

While the conventional uses of vending machines and conventional business relationships among the entities involved directly or indirectly in the vending of goods from vending machines have been readily employed in the past they are woefully inadequate in meeting future objectives for vending goods. For example it would be desirable to permit an entity other than the operator to share in the risks and rewards i.e. the losses and profits of vending goods from a vending machine. Conventional vending machines and conventional business relationships however are ill equipped to achieve this result primarily due to the inherent problems in verifying sales data and enforcing contractual obligations involving the vending of goods. Indeed a seller of goods would not be motivated to enter into an agreement with an operator to share in the risks and rewards of vending its goods from a vending machine if it is difficult for the seller of goods to verify the sales data of the vending machine and or enforce the obligations of any agreement governing such a relationship. Since the operator has virtually exclusive control over the vending machine particularly in terms of stocking goods and collecting revenue any share of the risks and rewards from vending goods are subject to the honesty and integrity of the operator. While it would be unfair to suggest that all operators are untrustworthy it has been discovered that as a practical matter other entities have been unwilling to enter into agreements to share in the risks and rewards of goods vending with operators due to concerns of data verification and enforcement.

Efforts have been made in the vending art to make data concerning the sales of goods from a vending machine available to interested parties. The so called Direct Data Exchange DEX format of vending data reporting purports to provide a means for obtaining sales information such as type of goods brand of goods package type weight price etc. Members of the National Automatic Merchandizing Association NAMA and others however understand that the DEX format has not been standardized and therefore is of marginal use as a tool in obtaining useful vending data from the field. Moreover the accuracy of the DEX information is subject to the data collection and reporting processes of the operator. Indeed an unscrupulous operator could easily tamper with forge or otherwise modify vending data obtained at a particular vending machine and arrange the data in the DEX format in an effort to legitimize the data to his or her advantage and consequently to the disadvantage of other parties that may be seeking to rely on the DEX data.

Accordingly there is a need in the vending art for apparatus and methods that will facilitate agreements among entities with interests in vending goods in addition to the operator to share in the risks and rewards of vending. Indeed distributing the risks associated with purchasing installing stocking and selling goods through a vending machine among two or more entities will encourage people heretofore not willing to participate in the vending of goods and therefore expand the marketplace and ultimately provide better service to consumers.

The following invention is especially useful for equipment which is leased rented loaned or licensed from one entity to another entity such as a washing machine or an industrial or household appliance or where one entity has an interest in controlling the usage of equipment which a second entity is in the physical control possession custody etc. of the equipment with at least one other interested entity where the system includes 

iii. the at least one other computer system compares the information received to a database and determines whether the equipment is being used in a prescribed manner 

iv. if the equipment is being used in a prescribed manner then the one other computer can release a continuation code which can be communicated back to the first computer which can prevent the first computer from being disabled.

b. A piece of equipment controlled by an equipment computer control system linked to the equipment and whereby the equipment computer control system is operable to disable the equipment upon the occurrence of a predetermined parameter being met.

c. Where the equipment computer control system can record data relating to at least one attribute such as time usage unauthorized uses or parameter in the equipment and is able to release at least some of the data to another computer control system through some communication link.

d. Where the equipment computer control system can store a program memory which enables the equipment to perform a complete range of functions.

e. Where the computer control system can store in its memory prescribed parameters which determine specific restrictions or limitations which limit the equipment from being able to perform a complete range of operation to not being able to operate.

f. Where at least some of the data recorded by the equipment control system can be communicated from the equipment using a data link and preferably using an encryption technique to secure the data to an external computer system.

g. Where the external computer system can receive the data from the equipment. If the data is encrypted it can be decrypted and thereby authenticated as genuine and unadulterated data and

h. Where the external computer system is able to store information relating to the prescribed parameters which relate to its authorized usage.

i. The external computer system compares the usage and the specific ways in which the equipment was used to determine what if any action or decision should be taken

2 In addition to the above the piece of machinery or equipment can also have security circuits throughout the system so that if the computer is altered or changed the other components in the equipment would refuse to work thus disabling operability of the equipment.

3 In some cases the equipment has multiple capabilities so that it can be used with more or less features or limitations some or all of which can be disabled or modified based on information received monitored or learned by the equipment control system.

4 As described above where the amount of usage must first be reported back to the external computer before a continuation code can be released such as with a leased car etc. 

5 This data can also be used to build a database to allow an equipment manufacturer or finance company understand how the equipment is being used This can be useful information when designing finance plans marketing advertising plans and equipment.

6 As described above were the external computer system takes into consideration the information communicated from the equipment computer control and the information within the database relating to the creditworthiness of at least one entity.

7 Computer systems first and external and their control aspects and their link to other apparatus in the machine.

Numerous scenarios are contemplated by the present invention which utilize the described invention and many permutations of the invention are possible.

With reference to a vending apparatus is illustrated that is suitable for use in accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention such as the vending of goods.

For the purposes of illustration and simplicity reference may be made herein to the vending apparatus in a conventional vending machine environment although it is intended that the vending apparatus is suitable for more general article handling retrieval and or dispensing purposes as well as point of sale POS dispensing. The vending apparatus if embodied as a portable device may be for example about the size of a traditional vending machine A or as large as a tractor pulled trailer.

Alternatively the vending apparatus if embodied as a non portable device may be embodied as an automated dispensing room B or an area located in a permanent structure such as in a building aboveground or underground and with or without interior walls or an enclosing cabinet . The vending apparatus may take on the size of a small medium or large room or building. Such a vending apparatus may be located in an office and any type of goods may be stored and dispensed to employees or other people within the office. For example office supplies i.e. goods may be stored within the vending apparatus and dispensed to people in the office with a need for office supplies.

Alternatively the vending apparatus may be disposed at locations where convenience stores are typically found for example gas stations rest stops etc. such that goods that are typically found in convenience stores may be vended to purchasers. One skilled in the art will appreciate that variations in the sizes of scales of location of e.g. above or below ground etc. and goods vended from apparatus in accordance with the invention are infinite and should only be limited by the claims appended hereto.

It is intended that the term goods or articles includes any products packaged goods etc. such as food beverages snacks trinkets office supplies groceries consumer goods etc.

Referring again to the vending apparatus includes a main cabinet and a door mounted on a hinge for providing access to an interior portion. Servicing e.g. stocking with goods performing maintenance actions collection of revenue etc. may be performed through the door . The door is shown in a closed position forming an enclosure with the main cabinet within which various components of the vending apparatus are disposed as will be explained in more detail below.

A goods retrieval area is formed in a panel of the door so that goods stored within the vending apparatus can be dispensed to a user. The panel preferably includes graphics or other indicia which indicates the various goods vendible by the vending apparatus as well as the associated price and unique selection number. The graphics on panel may be non alterable e.g. pre printed thereby fixing the type brand price etc. of vendible goods. Alternatively the graphics on panel may be at least partially alterable such that changes in the type brand price etc. of the vendible goods may be reflected by the graphics. For example the graphics on panel may be divided into an alterable portion A and a non alterable portion B which may be a subportion or the remainder of the panel where the alterable portion A may be changed. Details concerning how the alterable portion A may be changed is discussed below with reference to .

The ability to change the alterable portion A of the panel and therefore the indicia presented to the user yields a ratio of areas of alterable graphics to non alterable graphics on the panel . A corresponding ratio of vendible goods e.g. a ratio of one type of vendible goods to another type of vendible goods within the vending apparatus is also contemplated. Indeed it may be desirable to require that the ratio of sales inventory etc. of the goods represented by the indicia on the alterable portion A to the goods represented by the indicia on the non alterable portion B corresponds to e.g. either matches or is derived from the ratio of areas of alterable graphics to non alterable graphics. Further details concerning the use of alterable and non alterable graphics portions may be found in International Publication No. WO 01 11578.

The keypad mechanism preferably of conventional design and construction is preferably operable to enable the user to select one or more desired goods from the vending apparatus . It is noted that the keypad mechanism may be individual and or a matrix of push buttons for each article selection and an associated price display and or a user operated touch screen that may include the integrated display .

Although the vending apparatus as illustrated preferably includes all of the above described user interface elements in a more minimal embodiment of the invention most if not all of these user interface elements may be omitted and the vending apparatus may be controlled from a remote location with or without a local payment system. Additionally the customer retrieval port may also be remote from the vending apparatus and a goods conveyor system may be used to convey the articles to the remote customer retrieval port.

With reference to a perspective view into the vending apparatus of is shown. In particular the door stands open to expose various electrical mechanical and electromechanical components of the vending apparatus . It is understood that is somewhat simplified for the purposes of clarity and discussion.

The door preferably includes a slot C that is operable to permit the insertion and extraction of the alterable portion A of the panel discussed hereinabove with respect to . As shown the slot C is formed such that horizontal insertion and extraction is enabled it being understood however that the slot C may be formed so as to permit differently sized and shaped alterable portions A and or to permit vertical insertion and extraction without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is noted that the panel preferably includes a substantially transparent window that assists in the enclosure of the alterable portion A while permitting a user to view the indicia on the alterable portion A through the transparent portion of the panel which aligns with portion A .

The vending apparatus preferably includes a storage area at least one electromechanical retrieving device and a dispensing chute . The storage area preferably includes a plurality of compartments operable to store the various goods. Preferably the compartments are implemented using vertically aligned article storage bins as shown. As will be discussed below however the compartments may be horizontally aligned or in any other configuration without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is noted that the compartments function to produce vertically aligned horizontally aligned and or inclined stacks e.g. columns and or rows of the goods and may employ any suitable mechanical means such as open and or closed sides etc. for supporting the goods. Further details concerning some aspects of the compartments may be found in PCT US01 16847.

When one or more of the compartments are used to retain goods that require refrigeration they may be disposed in thermal communication with e.g. contained within disposed above disposed below etc. a refrigeration unit not shown . Further details concerning the use of a refrigeration unit in combination with the vending apparatus may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 5 240 139 entitled PACKAGE VENDING MACHINE the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

A container is preferably operable to hold a plurality of the compartments in an aligned manner and thereby facilitate simultaneous handling i.e. removal installation and transportation of the compartments into and out of the storage area for re stocking the compartments with new goods. Advantageously the container facilitates rapid and accurate positioning of the plurality of article storage bins in the storage area .

In the illustrated embodiment using vertically aligned compartments the retrieving device is preferably disposed at an upper portion of the cabinet and is preferably operable to retrieve goods from within compartments of the storage area and to dispose the goods in the dispensing chute . The electromechanical retrieving device preferably includes a carriage and an air hose . The carriage is preferably operable to move in an X Y plane such that the air hose may be located over any of the compartments . For example in response to a selection made by the user the carriage preferably moves to an X Y location corresponding to a position centered over one of the compartments holding the selected good.

With reference to the air hose preferably includes an article contacting free end and a distal end coupled to a vacuum unit . The vacuum unit is preferably operable to impart suction at the free end of the air hose . The free end of the air hose is preferably adapted to selectively engage with any of the goods stored in the storage area . For example the free end of the air hose may contact a particular article meeting the selection requirements of the user. In other words the free end of the air hose is adapted to contact the article contained within the compartment over which the air hose has been located in response to the user s selection. To this end the free end of the air hose is preferably operable to also move in a Z direction vertically in the example shown in the drawings by way of a Z direction drive such as pinch rollers that engage the air hose in carriage . Rollers and maintain a storage loop in the air hose in a space which is parallel to an inside vertical wall of cabinet in order to satisfy the Z direction movement of the free end .

In use the free end of the air hose imparts suction on the article being vended such that as the air hose is retracted the contacted article is extracted from the compartment . The carriage then moves to an X Y position over the dispensing chute and the suction is quickly stopped such that the article is released from the free end and falls through the dispensing chute to the goods retrieval area . Further details regarding the electromechanical retrieving device and alternative devices may be found in Patent Application No. PCT US01 16853.

Although for the purposes of illustrating the invention a preferred electromechanical retrieving device has been described above it is noted that any of the known or hereinafter developed electromechanical magnetic or other means for retrieving articles in a vending machine may be employed without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as claimed herein. For example in the event that horizontally aligned compartments are employed an alternative retrieving device e.g. using suction and or a gripping mechanism may be used to extract the goods from within or at a dispensing end thereof. Further the use of a curvilinear plane for article transport may be utilized as is known in the videocassette vending art. Details concerning horizontally aligned compartments may be found for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 230 930 issued May 15 2001 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR VENDING PRODUCTIONS the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

In accordance with one or more further aspects of the present invention the vending apparatus preferably includes and article identification ID device that is mounted within the cabinet . Any suitable design and implementation of the article ID device may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example the article ID device may employ one or more of an optical technology such as a bar code scanner for reading a unique article ID e.g. a UPC code preprinted on the goods an image recognition system an analog and or digital still camera an analog and or digital video camera. Alternatively the article ID device may employ electromagnetic technology such as a radio frequency identification transponder RFID or a magnetic reader for article identification using electromagnetic tags included with the goods. The article ID device is preferably mounted within the cabinet at a substantially fixed location such that the goods stored in the storage area may be scanned as they are moved from the compartments to the dispensing chute by the electromechanical retrieving device . Alternatively the article ID scanning may take place before or after such goods dispensing movement. Further the article ID device may be mounted on the carriage and or on the free end of the air hose . Preferably only a single article ID device is employed when the electromechanical retrieving device discussed above is used to move the goods from the storage area to the dispensing chute . Indeed the electromechanical retrieving device described hereinabove and shown in is preferably operable to move the article past the article ID device to obtain a scan of any of the goods stored in the storage area . Details concerning the types of information gleaned from such scanning and uses thereof will be discussed more fully hereinbelow.

With reference to a functional block diagram of certain aspects circuits and or systems of the vending apparatus is shown. In particular a control system including a microprocessor and an associated memory is preferably in electrical cooperation with peripheral circuits systems such as a user interface system a retrieving device driver a communications unit the vacuum unit the article ID device and or system and one or more position sensors . Although a digital microprocessor is preferred it is understood that the control system may be implemented using analog techniques including electromechanical techniques as known in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

The memory preferably includes read only memory ROM and random access memory RAM . The ROM is preferably used for storing one or more control programs e.g. software that provides instructions to the microprocessor . These instructions preferably cause the microprocessor to produce control signaling to one or more of the user interface system the retrieving device driver the comnmunications unit the vacuum unit the article ID device and the one or more position sensors and or any other electronic circuits useful in implementing the vending apparatus . In particular the instructions are preferably operable to cause the combination of the microprocessor and the peripheral circuits and or systems to perform the actions and or functions described herein and or shown in the accompanying drawings it being understood that the particular software code may be readily determined by one skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

The RAM of the memory is preferably used for temporary storage of data monitored calculated and or received by the vending apparatus during operation. The data may include for example data obtained from the article ID device data obtained from the user interface system etc. Further details concerning the monitoring storing and or processing of this and or other data will be discussed later in this description.

The user interface system preferably includes one or more of the display the bill acceptor mechanism and insertion slot the coin acceptor mechanism and insertion slot the coin return actuator the coin return well the credit debit card reader mechanism and card insertion slot and the keypad mechanism .

By way of example the control program providing instructions to the microprocessor preferably coordinates the display of information to the user the receipt of selections from the user and the receipt of payment from and dispensing of change to the user concerning the vending of goods from the vending apparatus . In particular after appropriate remittance has been made and or arranged for the user s selection is preferably input through the keypad mechanism to the microprocessor and stored at least temporarily in RAM . The microprocessor preferably produces one or more dispensing commands based on the user s selection which are input into the retrieving device driver . The retrieving device drivers are preferably operatively coupled to the electromechanical retrieving device and cause it to move into the proper X Y position relative to the compartment in which the selected article is stored. Preferably one or more of the position sensors are utilized to provide feedback to the microprocessor and or retrieving device drivers as to whether the air hose is in the proper X Y position. The Z direction drive pinch roller portion of the retrieving device drivers is also preferably operable to cause the air hose to move in the Z direction i.e. into one or more of the compartments of the storage area .

Preferably one or more of the position sensors are operable to provide feedback to the microprocessor and or the retrieving device driver as to whether the free end of the air hose has engaged the selected article . For example the position sensors may include an airflow sensor e.g. in vacuum box operable to determine whether a flow of air through the air hose has been substantially impeded i.e. when the free end of the air hose comes into secure contact with the selected article . The airflow sensor may be implemented for example using a hinged flap within the vacuum box that includes a magnet disposed on a free end portion thereof. When air is flowing through vacuum box the hinged flap is oriented in a direction substantially parallel to the airflow direction and parallel with a longitudinal wall of vacuum box . A corresponding reed switch is disposed on the longitudinal wall of the vacuum box such that it is adjacent to the magnet on the hinged flap when substantial air flow exits i.e. when the free end of the air hose has not yet engaged the article and the hinged flap is in a transverse orientation with respect to the air flow direction when an article is engaged by the free end .

At an appropriate time preferably prior to the free end of the air hose contacting the article the microprocessor preferably signals the vacuum unit to activate such that suction is achieved at the free end of the air hose . It is noted that many variations in the time of the vacuum unit activation may be employed such as may be desirable when refrigeration is used to keep the goods cool and excessive evacuation of cool air by the air hose is to be avoided. 

The control system and the microprocessor in particular determined when an article has been securely engaged by the free end e.g. in response to the air flow sensor in vacuum box and preferably commands the retrieving device drivers to reverse the air hose in the Z direction such that the selected article is removed from the compartment . The microprocessor then preferably commands the retrieving device driver to cause the carriage to move into an X Y position in alignment with the dispensing chute . Preferably one or more of the position sensors are operable to determine whether the air hose and selected article are in alignment with the dispensing chute . For example one or more reed switches may be mounted on a front wall of the cabinet and one or more associated magnets may be mounted on the carriage where magnetic communication between the one or more magnets and the reed switch provides a signal to the control system that proper positioning of the carriage relative to the dispensing chute has been obtained.

It is most preferred that the microprocessor commands the carriage to move the article substantially near the article ID device e.g. prior to aligning with the dispensing chute such that data may be obtained concerning the article . This will be discussed in further detail hereinbelow. 

The microprocessor then preferably commands the vacuum unit to be deactivated such that suction within the air hose is substantially diminished and the selected article is released from the free end and drops through the dispensing chute to the goods retrieval area . It is noted that in the event that the selected article is fragile and should not be subject to sever impact forces the microprocessor may command the retrieving device driver to drive the air hose into the dispensing chute such that the article is delicately released at the goods retrieval area .

Although the vending apparatus preferably includes all of the functional blocks illustrated in it is understood that any one or more of the functional blocks may be employed partitioned as shown or in any combination without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example in a more fundamental configuration the vending apparatus may include the control system the user interface system and the retrieving device driver . Such a configuration may be employed using the particular retrieving device discussed above any of the known retrieving devices or any retrieving devices hereafter developed as may be advantageous in a specific embodiment. Examples of known retrieving devices include article engaging spiral activated devices gravity assisted beverage dispensing devices e.g. solenoid activated gates electromechanical robotic gripping devices alone or in combination with elevators and or conveyors etc.

It has been discovered in accordance with one or more aspects of the invention that benefits are obtained when the control system whether of a digital or analog configuration is operable to enable and or disable the dispensing of at least some of the goods stored in the vending apparatus . For example is a flow diagram illustrating a process that is preferably carried out using the control system it being most preferred that the process is executed by way of a software program running on the microprocessor platform .

At action the vending apparatus is preferably operating in at least a partially enabled state such that at least some of the goods stored within the vending apparatus may be dispensed to a user. The vending apparatus is preferably enabled for a predefined interval illustrated by a wait loop between actions and . At an end of the predefined interval an inquiry is preferably made as to whether a continuation code has been received by the vending apparatus action . If the result of the inquiry is negative then the process preferably branches to action where the vending apparatus is preferably at least partially disabled e.g. such that at least some of the goods stored within the vending apparatus may not be dispensed therefrom . If however the result of the inquiry is affirmative then the process flow preferably branches to action where the interval is reset and the vending apparatus is permitted to remain in the enabled state e.g. such that at least some of the goods may be dispensed therefrom .

The continuation code is preferably an electronic code that is input to the vending apparatus through at least one of i the keypad mechanism ii a dedicated keypad not shown e.g. a service keypad or any other keypad that may be available for example only by opening the door of the vending apparatus iii a portable computing device not shown that is operable to connect to the communications unit e.g. through a data port or the like and iv a communications network to which the vending apparatus is connected e.g. through the communications unit . When a communications network is employed to input the continuation code into the vending apparatus I the communications network may include for example at least one of a wire network a telephone network a radio frequency link an infrared link a local area network a wide area network the Internet etc.

It is noted that the continuation code may be subject to cryptography such that a decryption algorithm is employed within the vending apparatus e.g. in the control system to decode the continuation code. This would provide a high level of confidence that only authentic continuation codes may be utilized to enable the vending apparatus . Any of the known cryptographic techniques may be employed such as transposition substitution polyalphabetic substitution conventional key encryption public key encryption cipher systems code systems etc. which may or may not use a serial number of the vending apparatus as part of the technique e.g. to make it unique to the vending apparatus .

The predefined interval actions and preferably represents at least one of i one or more predefined periods of time ii one or more predefined numbers of vends of goods from the vending apparatus or iii one or more predefined quanta of sales by the vending apparatus . It is noted that this quanta may be one or more amounts of money of time of units of goods vended etc. For example when the predefined interval is a period of time such as 30 days the control system preferably is operable to disable the vending apparatus from dispensing at least some of the goods when an end of the interval e.g. the 30day is reached. It is understood however that if the continuation code is received by the vending apparatus prior to an end of the 30th day then the control system preferably does not disable the vending apparatus from dispensing at least some of the goods. Indeed the interval is preferably reset and the control system preferably permits the vending apparatus to dispense at least some of the goods for another interval.

When a predefined interval comprising a predefined number of vending cycles has occurred the control system may be programmed so as to at least partially disable the vending apparatus from further dispensing at least some of the goods such as when five hundred articles have been dispensed from the vending apparatus . Again however the control system preferably permits the vending apparatus to remain in an enabled state when the continuation code is received prior to the end of the interval i.e. prior to the five hundredth vending cycle . Those skilled in the art will appreciate that many modifications and variations in the predefined interval may be implemented without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

It is noted that the process control of the vending apparatus may prescribe that the vending apparatus be enabled for sequential intervals so long as respective continuation codes are received by the vending apparatus for each interval . Preferably an algorithm is used during the generation of the continuation codes such that no two sequential continuation codes are identical. For example a portion of previously transmitted data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus may be used to generate a subsequent continuation code such that it would be nearly impossible to predict a future continuation code. Advantageously this would prevent an entity to the agreement e.g. the operator from determining the continuation code on his or her own and entering the same without authorization.

Advantageously the control process illustrated in is useful in encouraging one or more entities to enter into agreements with one another concerning sales of goods from the vending apparatus or a plurality of vending apparatus . For example an operator of the vending apparatus may enter into at least one contractual obligation with at least one other entity concerning sales of goods from the vending apparatus . The other entity may be for example a lender who has loaned money to the operator to purchase the vending apparatus a lessor who has rented the vending apparatus to the operator and or a holder of property who has rented space to the operator on which the vending apparatus is located. Alternatively the other entity may include one or more of a manufacturer of the vending apparatus a seller of one or more goods that are to be vended from the vending apparatus a distributor or agent of the seller of goods etc.

Irrespective of the particular relationships of the entities involved and in accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention the entities preferably agree that i the vending apparatus may be enabled to dispense goods for a predefined interval ii the vending apparatus is predisposed to be at least partially disabled from dispensing at least some of the goods at the end of the interval and iii the vending apparatus is not at least partially disabled at the end of the interval if a continuation code is received by the vending apparatus before the end of the interval.

The above method defining an agreement between the entities e.g. the operator and the seller of goods concerning sales of goods from the vending apparatus provides assurance to for example the seller of goods that the one or more contractual obligations of the operator are likely to be met. Indeed when the seller of goods has at least some control over whether the continuation code is received by the vending apparatus and the operator does not have such control then the operator will be motivated to fulfill his or her contractual obligations to the seller of goods. Advantageously the vending apparatus need not be actually disabled and business disrupted to ensure that the contractual obligations are met. Indeed the receipt of the continuation code by the vending apparatus provides an incentive to adhere to the terms of a contract while providing seamless uninterrupted operation and vending.

In accordance with one or more aspects of the invention it is preferred that an agreement is reached between the entities that the continuation code is made available to the vending apparatus after a determination is made that the at least one contractual obligation has been satisfied or waived. For example the seller of goods may make a determination that the operator has fulfilled his or her contractual obligation to the seller of goods and in response make the continuation code available to the vending apparatus such that the operator may continue to enjoy the financial benefits of operating the vending apparatus . On the other hand the seller of goods may withhold the continuation code from the vending apparatus if a determination is made that the operator has not met his or her contractual obligations to the seller of goods thereby providing the seller of goods with leverage over the operator e.g. by preventing the operator from enjoying the financial benefits of operating the vending apparatus . Further details concerning illustrative examples of what the contractual obligations may include and how they may be obtained will be discussed later in this description.

It is noted that the control process of the vending apparatus may prescribe that the vending apparatus may be automatically re enabled after having been disabled for failure to receive a continuation code. For example the specter of having the vending apparatus disabled for a substantial period of time e.g. seven days one month etc. may be sufficient incentive to ensure the entities that the obligations concerning sales of goods from the vending apparatus will be met. Thus in one embodiment the vending apparatus may be automatically re enabled after the period of time has passed.

It is noted that the actions of determining whether the at least one contractual obligation is satisfied and or making the continuation code available to the vending apparatus may take on many forms and be performed by various parties without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Some general and specific examples of the communication that may take place between entities as related to these determinations will now be discussed with reference to . By way of example and with reference to a first entity e.g. the operator may have entered into one or more contractual obligations with a second entity e.g. the seller of goods with the understanding that the seller of goods would make the continuation code available to the vending apparatus when it determines that the operator has met the one or more obligations.

In accordance with one aspect of the present invention the seller of goods preferably receives prescribed data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus in a form and with substance that is suitable to determine whether the operator has met its obligations with the seller of goods . It is noted that the mechanisms and or methods by which the prescribed data are received by for example the seller of goods will be discussed in detail later in this description. Such data may include for example whether unauthorized goods have been vended a quantum of sales concerning one or more goods etc. Further details concerning illustrative examples of what the prescribed data may include and how it may be obtained will be described later in this description. Assuming that the operator has met its obligations to the seller of goods the seller of goods may generate the continuation code and release the continuation code directly to the vending apparatus e.g. by way of the keypad mechanism the dedicated keypad the data port of the vending apparatus a communications network etc. Alternatively the seller of goods may release the continuation code to an entity responsible for inputting the continuation code into the vending apparatus such as the operator .

With reference to an alternative arrangement may be employed in accordance with another aspect of the present invention where an authorized third party may at least one of i receive the prescribed data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus ii generate the continuation code and iii release the continuation code to the vending apparatus to an intermediate entity and or to an entity responsible for inputting the continuation code into the vending apparatus such as the operator .

Preferably the authorized third party receives the prescribed data and makes the prescribed data available to the seller of goods either in its raw form and or after processing such that the seller of goods may make a determination as to whether the one or more contractual obligations have been satisfied. If they have the seller of goods preferably authorizes the third party to at least one of generate and release the continuation code either directly to the vending apparatus and or to another entity such as the operator for input to the vending apparatus . It is noted that the seller of goods may generate the authorization code itself or may authorize the third party to generate the continuation code.

Alternatively the entities may authorize the third party to receive the prescribed data determine whether the contractual obligations have been met generate the continuation code and make the same available to the vending apparatus without any intervention by another entity such as the seller of goods . Advantageously in accordance with these aspects of the present invention the burden of management on the part of the seller of goods may be shifted to the third party for the purposes of efficiency and or convenience.

It is noted that further examples of the relationships and communications among entities with an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus are presented later in this description with reference to .

As discussed above one of the many conditions upon which the continuation code may be made available to the vending apparatus is whether one or more contractual obligations among entities have been satisfied. This determination may be based on an analysis of prescribed data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . Presented below are illustrative examples of contractual obligations and prescribed data contemplated by the invention it being understood that these examples are not exhaustive and many variations and or modifications of the same are within the scope of the invention. In reviewing these examples one skilled in the art will appreciate that in many situations the contractual obligations and the prescribed data are similar in character. For example one contractual obligation may be to sell 20 of the total sales from the vending apparatus of brand ABC corn chips within each month. The prescribed data upon which a determination is made as to whether this contractual obligation has been met may be i the quantum of brand ABC corn chips sold in each month and ii the quantum of all other goods sold in each month.

Turning now to the illustrative examples one skilled in the art will appreciate from the disclosure herein that the variations in the particular contractual obligations between the entities in accordance with the present invention are vast. By way of example the contractual obligations may include at least one of 

 iv an obligation to provide a quantum of money to the at least one entity e.g. a rent payment a lease payment a finance payment etc. 

 v an obligation to provide a quantum of money to the at least one entity based on the sales of goods from the vending apparatus 

 vii an obligation to store specific goods in specific storage compartments which may include the orientation of the goods in the compartments 

 ix an obligation to maintain a prescribed ratio of a quantum of one or more goods to a quantum of storage space for goods in the vending apparatus 

 xi an obligation to dispense prescribed quanta of one or more goods from the vending apparatus in a predefined period of time 

 xii an obligation to receive a prescribed quantum of money at the vending apparatus in a predefined period of time 

 xiii an obligation to sell a prescribed ratio of one or more of the goods to one or more others of the goods 

 xiv an obligation to sell a prescribed ratio of one or more of the goods to one or more others of the goods in a predefined period of time 

 xv an obligation to make prescribed data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus available to the at least one entity 

Those skilled in the art will appreciate from the disclosure herein that variations on the obligation to sell only authorized goods are vast. By way of example the obligation to sell only authorized goods may include at least one of 

One skilled in the art will appreciate from the disclosure herein that determinations as to whether the one or more contractual obligations between entities have been met may be conducted in any number of ways and that the information used to make the determinations may be gathered in various ways. It is preferred that the determinations are made by analyzing the prescribed data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . Most preferably the prescribed data whether in final data form or in raw data form from which the final data are computed or generated are monitored stored and released by the vending apparatus . Further details concerning the mechanisms and or methods by which the prescribed data are monitored stored and or released are discussed later in this description with respect to .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the prescribed data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus may take on many forms without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example the prescribed data may include at least one of 

 iii a ratio of one or more types of the goods sold to one or more other types of the goods sold in a predefined period of time 

 iv a ratio of one or more brands of the goods sold to one or more other brands of the gods sold in a predefined period of time 

 viii information concerning what a next choice of goods was made by a purchaser when a particular good was out of inventory 

 xvi any data that may be monitored received calculated etc. by the control system concerning the vending apparatus .

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the information concerning any limitations under which the vending apparatus vends the goods may take on many forms without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is noted that these limitations relate to for example how goods are vended how information concerning the vendible goods is presented to the user and or to other entities how much vending may take place before vending is at least temporarily disabled etc. For example the information concerning the limitations under which the vending apparatus vends the goods may include at least one of 

 iv whether and or what advertising indicia must be displayed on the vending apparatus in a prescribed way 

 v whether a and or what prescribed ratio of a quantum of one or more goods to a quantum of storage space for goods in the vending apparatus must be maintained 

 vi whether a and or what prescribed number of goods selections in the vending apparatus must be maintained 

 vii whether only a and or what prescribed maximum number of goods selections in the vending apparatus are permitted even though the storage area would otherwise have sufficient space to store additional selections 

 viii whether a and or what prescribed number of goods must be dispensed from the vending apparatus in a predefined period of time 

 ix whether a and or what prescribed quantum of money must be received at the vending apparatus in a predefined period of time 

 x whether a and or what prescribed ratio of one or more of the goods to one or more others of the goods must be vended from the vending apparatus 

 xi whether a and or what prescribed ratio of one or more of the goods to one or more others of the goods must be vended from the vending apparatus in a predefined period of time 

 xii whether and or what the vending apparatus must be maintained in operation to a prescribed degree and

One skilled in the art will appreciate that the obligation the prescribed data concerning and or the limitation not to tamper with the vending apparatus may include for example at least one of 

 ii not to tamper with the control system and or the peripheral systems circuits of the vending apparatus 

 iv not to alter at least a portion of the indicia on the exterior of the vending apparatus e.g. relating to the vendible goods therein and

 v not to alter any mechanical electrical electromechanical devices e.g. motors wire harnesses etc. including any security circuits therefore.

Various examples of contractual obligations between the entities with an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus have been given above. Preferably the vending apparatus includes mechanisms and or functional capabilities that aid in gathering data that may be used to determine whether one or more of the contractual obligations have been met. These mechanisms and or functional capabilities may permit an external mechanism to make the determination however they preferably provide the vending apparatus with the ability to make the determination internally. Details concerning the mechanisms and or functional capabilities of the vending apparatus as related to the determination of whether the contractual obligations have been met will now be provided. Irrespective of whether the determination is made internally or externally the vending apparatus is preferably operable to become at least partially disabled in response to the determination e.g. via operation of the control system or via an external mechanism such as an external computer system.

Compliance with the contractual obligation to vend only authorized goods may be determined for example by manually inspecting the vending apparatus to determine what goods are available therefrom although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. It is most preferred that the vending apparatus is capable of monitoring one or more parameters concerning the sales of goods therefrom and collecting the prescribed data whether in final form or in raw data form from which the final data may be computed and or generated .

To that end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor whether goods of an authorized type an authorized brand an authorized size an authorized weight an authorized expiration data an authorized package type an authorized period of manufacture an authorized place of manufacture etc. are being vended therefrom.

By way of example the article ID device may be used in the determination of whether authorized goods are being sold from the vending apparatus . The article ID device is preferably operable to obtain at least some of the above listed information by scanning the article and providing data to the microprocessor of the control system . For example when the article ID device includes a bar code scanner the UPC code on the article may be analyzed to determine the type the brand the size the weight the expiration data the package type the period of manufacture the place of manufacture etc. of the goods being vended. This data may be at least temporarily stored in the memory of the control system .

In an alternative embodiment the type the brand the size the weight etc. of the goods being vended may be gleaned from DEX data or other program data collected by the vending apparatus using more conventional techniques.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that these raw data are suitable for use in determining whether unauthorized goods are being or have been vended from the vending apparatus . These raw data may be released as prescribed data from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for an externally conducted determination. Preferably however the vending apparatus is operable to make the determination as to whether unauthorized goods are being or have been vended and therefore is operable to determine whether the contractual obligation relating thereto has been met. Thus the prescribed data may include one or more of the final data as to whether unauthorized goods are being or have been vended and further whether the contractual obligation relating thereto has been met.

Compliance with the contractual obligation to maintain inventory of one or more goods in the vending apparatus may be determined by for example manually inspecting the vending apparatus although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. To this end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor one or more parameters concerning the inventory of one or more goods stored therein and collecting the prescribed data whether in final form or in raw data form from which the final data may be computed and or generated . These parameters may include the number of goods maintained in the vending apparatus of one or more of a particular type brand size weight expiration data package type period of manufacture place of manufacture etc.

The control system in combination with the electromechanical retrieving device may be capable of conducting an inventory action on the goods stored within the vending apparatus . In one embodiment the electromechanical retrieving device may be commanded by the control system to remove goods to be inventoried from their positions within the storage area and to hold them temporarily in an alternative location within the storage area while the control system in combination with the article ID device counts the quanta of goods of a particular type brand size weight expiration data package type period of manufacture place of manufacture etc.

Indeed as discussed above the article ID device may be used to obtain at least some of the above listed information by scanning the article and providing data to the microprocessor of the control system . For example when the article ID device includes a bar code scanner the UPC code on the article may be analyzed to determine the type the brand the size the weight the expiration data the package type the period of manufacture the place of manufacture etc. of the goods being maintained in the vending apparatus . This data may be at least temporarily stored in the memory of the control system .

In this way raw data may be obtained to determine whether prescribed inventories are being maintained. These raw data may be released as prescribed data from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for an externally conducted determination. Preferably however the vending apparatus is operable to make the determination as to whether prescribed inventories are being maintained and therefore is operable to determine whether the contractual obligation relating thereto has been met. For example information concerning what the one or more prescribed inventories must be may be stored in the memory of the control system . The microprocessor of the control system is preferable operable to compare the one or more prescribed inventories with the raw data relating to the actual inventories being maintained in the vending apparatus . The result of the comparison yields the final data e.g. the determination as to whether the one or more prescribed inventories are being maintained. Further the result may yield other final data such as whether the contractual obligation relating to whether the one or more prescribed inventories are being maintained has been met.

The discussion immediately above has substantial applicability to determining whether the obligation to maintain a prescribed ratio of space occupied by one or more goods stored in the vending apparatus to the storage space available within the vending apparatus . Indeed the space available within the vending apparatus e.g. the size of the storage area is available to the microprocessor for example by way of the memory then the data obtained via the inventory operation conducted by the control system the article ID device and the electromechanical retrieving device may be i released by the vending apparatus e.g. via communications unit for and external determination ii used to internally compute e.g. via the microprocessor the actual ratio of space occupied by one or more goods stored in the vending apparatus to the storage space available iii used to determine whether the prescribed ratio is being maintained within the vending apparatus and or iv whether the contractual obligation relating to the prescribed ratio has been met.

Compliance with the contractual obligation not to steal money from and or to report all the money collected from the vending apparatus may be determined by for example confronting an offending entity e.g. the operator or catching that entity in the act of stealing or failing to report although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. To that end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor raw data from which a determination may be made as to whether money is being or has been stolen from the vending apparatus . The raw data may include for example the quanta of goods being sold from the vending apparatus the quanta of money being taken in by the vending apparatus and the date and or time of vends.

In one illustrative embodiment the vending apparatus may be operable to collect DEX data using known techniques which DEX data includes the raw data.

These raw data may be released as prescribed data from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for an externally conducted determination. Preferably however the vending apparatus is operable to make the determination as to whether money is being or has been stolen therefrom and further the determination as to whether the contractual obligation relating thereto has been met.

Among the ways in which a determination as to whether stealing has occurred includes comparing the quanta of money purportedly taken in by the vending apparatus as reported by and or provided by the operator with the actual quanta of money taken in by the vending apparatus monitored by the vending apparatus. Alternatively the quanta of goods sold as monitored by the vending apparatus may be compared against the money received and monitored by the vending apparatus and or reported by the operator to an interested entity. In either case the control system and the microprocessor in particular may preferably be used to conduct the comparison.

Compliance with the obligation to display goods in the vending apparatus in a prescribed way may be determined by for example physically inspecting the vending apparatus although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. To that end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor raw data from which a determination may be made as to whether one or more of the goods are displayed within the vending apparatus in a prescribed way. For example in a vending apparatus in which a user may view the goods through a window an entity e.g. the operator may be obligated to store one or more of the goods within the storage area of the vending apparatus in a prescribed way. This will typically be an issue when the vending apparatus is of the horizontally aligned container type discussed hereinabove with respect to etc. .

Preferably the control system is capable of at least obtaining raw data concerning whether the goods are displayed in the prescribed way by obtaining the spatial coordinates within the storage area at which particular goods are stored. These spatial coordinates may be stored in for example the memory and in use the control system may utilize these spatial coordinates in commanding the electromechanical retrieving device to those coordinates when dispensing goods from the vending apparatus . Alternatively when the vending apparatus is of the spiral dispensing variety the control system may readily provide an indication of which spirals are activated to dispense goods from the vending apparatus . It is also noted that if the vending apparatus collects DEX data using any of the known techniques such data may provide an indication of where the goods are displayed within the vending apparatus e.g. spiral locations corresponding to pre programmed user selections such as A1 A2 A3 A4 B1 B2 B3 B4 etc. .

One skilled in the art will appreciate that these raw data are suitable for use in determining whether the goods are displayed in the prescribed way within the vending apparatus . These raw data may be released as prescribed data from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for an externally conducted determination. Preferably however the vending apparatus is operable to make the determination as to whether the goods are displayed in the prescribed way and therefore is operable to determine whether the contractual obligation relating thereto has been met.

For example information concerning the prescribed way in which goods are to be displayed within the vending apparatus may be stored in the memory of the control system . The microprocessor of the control system is preferably operable to compare the prescribed way in which goods are to be displayed with the raw data relating to the actual way in which goods are or have been displayed within the vending apparatus . The result of the comparison yields the final data e.g. the determination as to whether the goods are displayed in the prescribed way. Further the result may yield other final data such as whether the contractual obligation relating to whether the goods are displayed in the prescribed way has been met.

Compliance with the obligation to display advertising indicia or other desirable graphics on the vending apparatus in a prescribed way may be determined by for example physically inspecting the vending apparatus although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. To that end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor raw data from which a determination may be made as to whether indicia are displayed in an authorized way at the vending apparatus .

By way of example the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor whether a specific display panel and or the alterable portion A thereof discussed hereinabove with respect to is in a prescribed configuration e.g. contains prescribed advertising indicia and that the indicia are displayed properly . In a preferred embodiment the alterable portion A and the panel each include at least one of an electronic an electromechanical and or a mechanical means useful for sensing whether an authorized panel or alterable portion A is being used. Preferably the panel and or the alterable portion A include an electronic security circuit that is operatively coupled to or in operative communication with a receiving circuit such that unauthorized removable of the alterable portion A may be sensed by the receiving circuit. For example the electronic security circuit may produce a unique code that when received indicates an authorized configuration of the panel and or the alterable portion A. Any of the known electronic security circuits may be utilized to implement the electronic security circuit such as a MicroChip encryption security chip. Alternatively the circuit may be a radio frequency identification RFID tag with corresponding reader as may be obtained for example from Motorola of San Jose Calif. As is known in the art the electronic security circuit preferably communicates with the receiving circuit or circuits by way of hard wire wireless communication etc. and preferably utilizes encryption. Further details concerning suitable implementation hardware for the electronic security circuits may be found at www.aimglobal.org a website of the global trade organization AIM. This website provides many details concerning article identification and data collection AIDC .

The receiving circuit may be another electronic security circuit located on another system circuit of the vending apparatus as will be discussed later in this description a dedicated circuit not shown the control system etc. Preferably the control system is or includes the receiving circuit and via the microprocessor determines whether the electronic security circuit of the panel and or the alterable portion A is present and if so emits a code.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that the raw data e.g. the emitted and received code or the lack thereof are suitable for use in determining whether the indicia are displayed in an authorized way at the vending apparatus . These raw data may be released as prescribed data from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for an externally conducted determination. Preferably however the vending apparatus is operable to make the determination as to whether the indicia are displayed in an authorized way and therefore is operable to determine whether the contractual obligation relating thereto has been met.

For example information concerning the prescribed way in which the indicia are to be displayed at the vending apparatus may be stored in the memory of the control system . The microprocessor of the control system is preferable operable to compare the prescribed way in which indicia are to be displayed with the raw data relating to the actual way in which the indicia are or have been displayed at the vending apparatus . The result of the comparison yields the final data e.g. the determination as to whether the indicia are displayed in the prescribed way. Further the result may yield other final data such as whether the contractual obligation relating to whether the indicia are displayed in the prescribed way has been met.

Compliance with the obligation to maintain a prescribed number of goods selections in the vending apparatus may be determined by for example physically inspecting the vending apparatus although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. To that end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor raw data from which a determination may be made as to whether the prescribed number of goods selections are or have been available in the vending apparatus .

In one embodiment the vending apparatus may be operable to collect DEX data utilizing known techniques which data may include an indication of the total number of goods selections available from the vending apparatus . For example the DEX data may indicate that there are twenty five goods selections available e.g. by way of the goods selection numbers labeled A1 A9 B1 B9 and C1 C7 .

In an alternative embodiment the vending apparatus is operable to obtain raw data concerning the actual number of goods selections that are available therefrom for example utilizing the control system and the microprocessor in particular. Indeed the memory of the control system preferably includes the actual number of goods selections that are available in the vending apparatus by way of the number of X Y positions programmed into the vending apparatus during setup so as to correspond with the positions of the vendible goods as arranged within the storage area discussed in detail hereinabove with respect to .

One skilled in the art will appreciate that the raw data e.g. actual number of goods selections that are available in the vending apparatus are suitable for use in determining whether the prescribed number of goods selections are or have been available in the vending apparatus . These raw data may be released as prescribed data from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for an externally conducted determination. Preferably however the vending apparatus is operable to make the determination as to whether the prescribed number of goods selections are or have been available in the vending apparatus and therefore is operable to determine whether the contractual obligation relating thereto has been met.

By way of example the memory of the control system may contain information concerning the prescribed number of goods selections that should be available in the vending apparatus . By comparing the prescribed number of goods selections with the raw data e.g. the actual number of goods selections available from the vending apparatus the control system preferably produces prescribed data indicating whether the prescribed number of goods selections has been maintained and further whether the contractual obligation related thereto has been met .

Compliance with the contractual obligation to sell and or dispense a prescribed quanta of one or more goods from the vending apparatus in a predefined period of time may be determined by for example a physical inspection of the vending apparatus querying the operator for the information necessary to make the determination etc. It is preferred the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. To that end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor raw data from which the determination may be made as to whether the prescribed quanta of one or more goods has been sold and or dispensed from the vending apparatus in the predefined period of time.

For example the control system of the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor the quantum of one or more groups of goods sold and or dispensed during one or more predefined periods of time. It is noted that the one or more groups of goods may for example be goods of a particular type a particular brand a particular size a particular weight a particular expiration date a particular package type a particular period of manufacture a particular place of manufacture etc. 

In one embodiment the information concerning the quantum of goods sold may be obtained by way of the combined functions of the control unit and the article ID device . Indeed as each article is sold and or dispensed from the vending apparatus the article ID device preferably scans the article and provides information obtained during the scan to the control system . The microprocessor of the control system preferably processes this information and stores at least a total of the goods sold and or dispensed of a particular group. Preferably the control system and the microprocessor in particular are operable to monitor the time and date of sale of goods.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that the raw data e.g. one or more totals of goods of respective groups sold and or dispensed and the time and or date of sale of goods are suitable for use in determining whether the prescribed quanta of one or more goods has been sold and or dispensed from the vending apparatus in the predefined period of time. These raw data may be released as prescribed data from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for an externally conducted determination. Preferably however the vending apparatus is operable to make the determination as to whether the prescribed quanta of one or more goods has been sold and or dispensed from the vending apparatus in the predefined period of time and therefore is operable to determine whether the contractual obligation relating thereto has been met.

By way of example the memory of the control system may contain information concerning the prescribed quanta of one or more goods that should be sold and or dispensed from the vending apparatus in the predefined period of time. By comparing the prescribed quanta of goods sold and or dispensed with the raw data e.g. the actual number of goods that were sold and or dispensed from the vending apparatus in the predefined period of time the control system preferably produces prescribed data indicating whether the prescribed quanta of one or more goods were sold and or dispensed from the vending apparatus and further whether the contractual obligation related thereto has been met .

Compliance with the contractual obligation to sell a prescribed ratio of one or more of the goods to one or more others of the goods may be determined in any number of ways although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. To that end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor raw data from which a determination may be made as to whether the prescribed ratio of the one or more of the goods to the one or more others of the goods has been sold from the vending apparatus .

By way of example the prescribed ratio of goods may be a ratio of types of goods e.g. a ratio of the number of corn chips sold to the number of potato chips sold a ratio of brands of goods e.g. a ratio of the number of brand ABC goods to the number of brand XYZ goods sold a ratio of sizes of goods e.g. a ratio of the number of size X goods to size Y goods sold a ratio of weights of goods a ratio of expiration dates of goods a ratio of package types of goods etc.

In one embodiment the article ID device preferably provides information to the control system concerning at least one of the type brand size weight expiration data package type period of manufacture place of manufacture etc. of each article sold and or dispensed from the vending apparatus . Preferably the control system at least temporarily stores this information in the memory . Further the control system preferably at least temporarily stores the times and or dates on which the goods are sold and or dispensed from the vending apparatus .

One skilled in the art will appreciate that this raw data may be utilized to determine whether the prescribed ratio of one or more of the goods to one or more others of the goods have been sold from the vending apparatus . Although the vending apparatus may release this raw data e.g. via the communications unit for an external determination it is preferred that the control system and the microprocessor in particular is operable to compute the one or more ratios. For example if the obligation in question is to sell a prescribed ratio of brand ABC goods to brand XYZ goods within a predefined period of time or on an ongoing basis the microprocessor preferably divides the number and or sales of ABC brand goods by the number and or sales of XYZ brand goods within the predefined period of time or on an ongoing basis .

The memory of the control system preferably contains information concerning the prescribed ratio of one or more of the goods to one or more others of the goods that should be sold from the vending apparatus e.g. in the predefined period of time . By comparing the prescribed ratio with the raw data e.g. the actual ratio the control system preferably produces prescribed data indicating whether the prescribed ratio of one or more of the goods to one or more others of the goods was sold from the vending apparatus and further whether the contractual obligation related thereto has been met .

Compliance with the contractual obligation to receive a prescribed quantum of money at the vending apparatus in a predefined period of time may be determined in any number of ways including a physical inspection of the vending apparatus although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. To that end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor raw data from which a determination may be made as to whether the prescribed quantum of money was received at the vending apparatus in a predefined period of time.

By way of example the control system is preferably operable to monitor the quanta of money received at the vending apparatus by way of information provided from the user interface system . Indeed each time money is received by the vending apparatus e.g. by way of the bill acceptor mechanism the coin acceptor mechanism the credit debit card reader mechanism etc. the control system and the microprocessor in particular preferably at least temporarily stores information indicative of the money received. As discussed above the control system may also be operable to collect and at least temporarily store the respective dates and or times on which goods are sold from the vending apparatus .

One skilled in the art will appreciate that this raw data is suitable for use determining whether the prescribed quanta of money was received at the vending apparatus in the predefined period of time. This raw data may be released by the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for an external determination. It is preferred however that the control system and the microprocessor in particular is operable to make the determination as to whether the prescribed quanta of money was received at the vending apparatus in the predefined period of time. For example the microprocessor preferably aggregates the amounts of money received over a particular time period i.e. the predefined period of time using the dates and or times that goods were vended from the vending apparatus .

The memory of the control system preferably contains information concerning the prescribed quanta of money that that should be received by the vending apparatus e.g. in the predefined period of time . By comparing the prescribed quanta of money received with the raw data e.g. the actual quanta of money received the control system preferably produces prescribed data indicating whether the prescribed quanta of money was received by the vending apparatus and further whether the contractual obligation related thereto has been met .

Compliance with the contractual obligation to maintain the vending apparatus in operation e.g. to a prescribed degree may be determined in any number of ways including physical inspection of the vending apparatus although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. In one embodiment the control system is preferably operable to monitor raw data from which a determination may be made as to whether the vending apparatus is operational to a prescribed degree e.g. whether the vending apparatus is or has been capable of vending goods and or to what degree the vending apparatus is or has been capable of vending goods.

For example the vending apparatus may be partially incapable of vending goods because it may only be capable of vending certain types brands weights sizes etc. of goods. On the other hand the vending apparatus may be entirely incapable of vending goods for various periods of time e.g. due to power outages mechanical failures etc. The control system and the microprocessor in particular is preferably operable to monitor such operational conditions of the vending apparatus and to at least temporarily store such information in the memory . The raw data may be released from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for external processing to determine whether the obligation to maintain the vending apparatus in operation to a prescribed degree may be made.

Preferably however the control system is capable of determining whether the vending apparatus has been maintained in operation to the prescribed degree and further determining whether the obligation related thereto has been met. For example the microprocessor of the control system is preferably operable to compare the prescribed degree to which the vending apparatus should be maintained operational which may be stored in the memory to the actual degree to which the vending apparatus has been operational. The actual degree to which the vending apparatus has been operational may be determined by monitoring data from one or more of the peripheral systems circuits discussed above with respect to . For example the microprocessor may monitor i whether power has been lost and for what periods of time ii whether certain groups of goods have been vendible from the vending apparatus e.g. using the article ID device etc.

Compliance with the contractual obligation not to tamper with the vending apparatus may be determined in any number of ways although it is preferred that the prescribed data provide the information necessary for making the determination. To that end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor raw data from which a determination may be made as to whether the vending apparatus has been tampered with. Tampering with the vending apparatus may include for example i movement of the vending apparatus to an unauthorized location ii removal and or altering of the control system and or the peripheral circuits systems and iii removal and or unauthorized altering of graphics e.g. advertising indicia concerning the goods stored within the vending apparatus such as the panel and or the alterable portion A thereof described hereinabove.

In one embodiment the vending apparatus preferably includes motion sensors e.g. a subset of the position sensors to sense whether the vending apparatus is being moved in an unauthorized manner. The motion sensors preferably provide raw data to the control system and the microprocessor in particular that indicates whether the vending apparatus is being rotated tilted and or otherwise moved. This raw data may be released as prescribed data from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for external an external determination as to whether the vending apparatus has been tampered with in an unauthorized manner. Preferably however the vending apparatus is capable of processing the raw data e.g. utilizing the microprocessor of the control system to determine whether the vending apparatus has been moved in an unauthorized manner. Any of the known algorithms for processing motion sensor information may be utilized for this purpose. Thus the vending apparatus may produce prescribed data including the determination as to whether the obligation not to tamper with the vending apparatus has been met.

In a further embodiment the vending apparatus preferably includes an electronic means for sensing whether unauthorized removal and or altering of the control system and or the peripheral circuits systems has occurred. To that end the control system and or the peripheral systems circuits preferably include an electronic security circuit best seen in that is operatively coupled to or in operative communication with a receiving circuit such that unauthorized removal and or alteration of the control system and or the peripheral systems circuits may be sensed by the receiving circuit. The electronic security circuit be implemented using substantially the same technology discussed hereinabove with respect to sensing unauthorized removal and or alteration of panel .

One skilled in the art will appreciate that the raw data e.g. the emitted and received code or lack thereof from the electronic security circuit and or the receiving circuit or circuits are suitable for use in determining whether the control system and or the peripheral systems circuits have been removed and or altered in an unauthorized manner. These raw data may be released as prescribed data from the vending apparatus e.g. via the communications unit for an externally conducted determination. Preferably however the vending apparatus is operable to make the determination as to whether the control system and or the peripheral systems circuits have been removed and or altered in an unauthorized manner and therefore is operable to determine whether the contractual obligation relating thereto has been met.

For example information concerning the authorized configuration of the control system and or peripheral systems circuits may be stored in the memory of the control system . The microprocessor of the control system is preferably operable to compare the stored information with the raw data relating to the actual condition of the control system and or peripheral systems circuits. The result of the comparison yields the final data e.g. the determination as to whether an unauthorized removal and or alteration has taken place. Further the result may yield other final data such as whether the contractual obligation relating to whether the control system and or peripheral systems circuits have been removed and or altered in an unauthorized way.

In keeping with the example above where the operator enters into a contract with the seller of goods one of the contractual obligations may be an obligation on the part of the operator to vend only goods authorized by the seller of goods. For example the seller of goods may be in the business of manufacturing and or distributing corn chips and may be interested in maintaining or expanding its market share. Thus the seller of goods may contract with an operator of one or more vending apparatus whereby the operator agrees to vend the seller s corn chips in exchange for for example a desirable price at which the operator may purchase the corn chips from the seller. In the past the seller of goods would have relatively little leverage in insuring that the operator met its contractual obligation to vend only the corn chips of the seller. In accordance with the invention however the seller of goods has the option of withholding the continuation code from the vending apparatus if the seller of goods learns that the operator is not living up to the agreement. Advantageously this will motivate the operator to adhere to the contractual obligations with the seller of goods. Moreover the above described apparatus and method will encourage entities to engage in such agreements thereby expanding the markets for the sales of goods from vending apparatus increasing the sales of vending apparatus and improving the vending experience to users.

Additional advantages are obtained using the vending apparatus and or method described herein. For example the operator may enter into an agreement with another entity to permit that entity to share in the risks and or rewards of vending goods from the vending apparatus . This may result in a number of contractual obligations between the parties including for example an obligation not to steal receipts and an obligation to provide a quantum of money to the other entity based on the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . When such an agreement is made between for example the operator and an investor who lends money to the operator to purchase rent or lease the vending apparatus a so called pay as you vend arrangement may be obtained. In other words the operator may pay the investor for the vending apparatus at least partially in accordance with the sales of goods from the vending apparatus subject to the usage fluctuations that will inevitably occur. This shifts some of the risks and rewards resulting from the sales of goods from the vending apparatus among the operator and the investor. Advantageously the vending apparatus in this example becomes a variable cost asset as opposed to a fixed cost asset of traditional vending machines. Heretofore the operator typically was the only party that obtained profits and or losses due to market fluctuations. Indeed other entities such as the investor heretofore expected a particular sum of money from the operator on a schedule irrespective of the usage fluctuations in the sales of goods. It is noted that it is preferred that the investor is in control of making the continuation codes available to the vending apparatus thereby having leverage to motivate the operator to meet his obligations.

By way of further example the operator may enter into a contract with the seller of goods and or the distributor or agent thereof where at least one contractual obligation between the parties includes for example an obligation to vend only authorized goods such as selling only goods of an authorized type brand size and or weight . Assuming that limiting the operator in this way would benefit the seller of goods e.g. in terms of market share profit loss etc. the seller of goods may provide the manufacturer of the vending apparatus with a quantum of money e.g. a rebate for manufacturing the vending apparatus in a way that facilitates such limitations under which the vending of goods may be performed. In other words the seller of goods will wish to motivate the manufacturer of the vending apparatus to design and manufacture the vending apparatus such that it will only vend authorized goods as specified by the seller of goods. Furthermore the operator may be motivated to purchase the vending apparatus even though it is subject to being disabled if a continuation code is not received at appropriate times because he or she may be provided with an incentive to do so for example by way of the manufacturer selling the vending apparatus to the operator at a discounted price such as a discount based on the rebate it received from the seller of goods.

Reference is now made to which is a flow diagram illustrating an alternative process to that of and which may be carried out using the control system . Again it is preferred that the process is executed by way of a software program running on the microprocessor platform . At action the vending apparatus is preferably operating in at least a partially enabled state such that at least some of the goods stored within the vending apparatus may be dispensed to a user. The vending apparatus is then preferably enabled for a predefined interval illustrated by a loop between actions and . At an end of the predefined interval the process flow preferably branches to action where the vending apparatus is preferably at least partially disabled e.g. such that at least some of the goods stored within the vending apparatus may not be dispensed therefrom . This disablement of the vending apparatus preferably lasts for a predefined period of time e.g. one hour . Before or after the predefined period of time has elapsed an inquiry is preferably made as to whether a continuation code has been received by the vending apparatus action . If the result of the inquiry is negative then the process preferably flows back to action where the vending apparatus remains disabled. If however the result of the inquiry is affirmative then the process flow preferably branches to action substantially immediately or after the predefined period of time has elapsed. At action the interval is preferably reset and the vending apparatus is permitted to enter an enabled state e.g. such that at least some of the goods may be dispensed therefrom .

Although the process flow illustrated in differs from the process flow of e.g. because in the former the vending apparatus is disabled for at least some period of time one skilled in the art will appreciate that the discussion hereinabove of regarding the details of the predefined interval the continuation code the flow of information between various entities etc. applies equally to the process flow of . For example the control process illustrated in just as was the case with is useful in encouraging one or more entities to enter into agreements with one another concerning sales of goods from the vending apparatus or a plurality of vending apparatus . Irrespective of the particular relationship of the entities involved and in accordance with one or more further aspects of the present invention the entities preferably agree that i the vending apparatus may be enabled to dispense goods for a predefined interval ii the vending apparatus is at least partially disabled from dispensing at least some of the goods at the end of the interval iii the vending apparatus remains at least partially disabled for a predefined period of time after the end of the interval irrespective of whether a continuation code was received before the end of the interval and iv the vending apparatus is at least partially re enabled if the continuation code is received by the vending apparatus before or after the end of the interval. The above method defining an agreement between the entities e.g. the operator and the seller of goods concerning sales of goods from the vending apparatus provides assurance to for example the seller of goods that the one or more contractual obligations of the operator are likely to be met.

Reference is now made to which is a flow diagram illustrating an alternative process in accordance with one or more aspects of the invention that is preferably carried out using the control system . Again it is most preferred that the process is executed by way of a software program running on the microprocessor platform . The process flow through actions and is substantially similar to the process flow discussed hereinabove with respect to and therefore the details relating to this portion of the process flow of will not be repeated.

Referring to action if the result of the inquiry i.e. as to whether the continuation code has been received by the vending apparatus is in the affirmative then the process flow preferably branches to action . At action an interval modification instruction is extracted from the continuation code it being understood that the interval modification instruction had been inserted into and or augmented with the continuation code prior to being received by the vending apparatus . It is noted that the interval modification instruction may be sent to the vending apparatus separate from the continuation code or any other code such as a disable code or a re enable code which are presented later in this description . At action the interval is at least one of reset and modified in response to the vending apparatus receiving the continuation code and more particularly in response to the vending apparatus receiving the interval modification instruction. For example the interval may be increased decreased or unchanged in response to the interval modification instruction. Advantageously this permits additional flexibility in structuring and or restructuring the agreement between the entities concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus .

It is noted that although the process flow concerning the modification of the interval e.g. actions and of have been discussed in terms of modifying the process flow of one skilled in the art will appreciate that the process flow of may be readily modified in light of the disclosure herein to permit the modification of the interval. For example process actions substantially similar to those of actions and may be inserted into the process flow of by substituting them for action .

Reference is now made to which is a flow diagram illustrating an alternative process in accordance with one or more aspects of the invention that is preferably carried out using the control system . Again it is preferred that the process is executed by way of a software program running on the microprocessor platform . Actions and are substantially similar to those of and therefore the details of these actions will not be repeated here.

Referring to action if the result of the inquiry i.e. as to whether the continuation code has been received by the vending apparatus is in the affirmative then the process flow preferably branches to action . At action a limitations modification instruction is preferably extracted from the continuation code. It is understood that the limitations modification instruction had been inserted into and or augmented with the continuation code prior to the continuation code having been received by the vending apparatus . Thus the limitations modification instruction may be entirely separate from the continuation code or any other code such as a disable code or re enable code which are presented later in this description . At action the limitations as to how the goods are vended from the vending apparatus are modified based on the limitations modification instruction obtained from the continuation code. Among the examples of the particular limitations that may be modified and that were discussed in detail hereinabove is the limitation to vend only authorized goods.

By way of example the limitations modification instruction may dictate that one or more of the limitations under which the vending apparatus was vending goods is eliminated. For example an operator may have an agreement with a lender e.g. a bank that the operator will pay the bank a certain percentage of the sales from the vending apparatus with the limitation that a prescribed quantum of money must be received by the vending apparatus in a predefined period of time e.g. to ensure that the bank gets minimum payments . When the operator has paid the bank in full however the operator may wish to operate the vending apparatus without limitation. In this case the bank may cause the limitations modification instruction to provide that this limitation be lifted.

At action the interval is preferably reset and the process flow preferably feeds back to action where the vending apparatus is permitted to enter and or remain in the enabled state e.g. such that at least some of the goods may be dispensed therefrom .

Although the process concerning the modification of vending limitations based on the limitations modification instruction of the continuation code has been discussed in terms of the basic process flow of those skilled in the art will appreciate that the process flow of may be modified to include this capability by for example inserting action and in between actions and of . Advantageously the ability to modify the vending limitations via the limitations modification instruction provides additional degrees of freedom for the entities to negotiate and or re negotiate the terms under which the goods may be dispensed from the vending apparatus .

The concept of at least partially disabling the vending apparatus from dispensing at least some of the goods stored therein has been discussed above e.g. regarding and will be further considered herein below. It is noted that those skilled in the art will appreciate from the disclosure herein that the particular mechanism and or process for disabling the vending apparatus may vary. A determination as to whether the vending apparatus should be disabled may be made externally e.g. via an external computer system or internally e.g. via the control system and a corresponding external and or internal disable signal generated to cause the vending apparatus to become at least partially disabled. For example the control system may prevent the electromechanical retrieving device from moving to the X Y position of one or more of the containers . Alternatively the control system may prevent the air hose from moving into contact with the article and or may prevent vacuum action when the X Y positions of the carriage corresponds to a container that contains goods that are disabled from being vended. Another alternative way to disable the dispensing of goods may include requiring that the retrieving device return the article to the storage area instead of placing it in the dispensing chute . A further alternative may be to disable the dispensing chute the bill acceptor mechanism the coin acceptor mechanism the card acceptor mechanism etc. Still further one or more motors and or electromechanical devices may be disabled.

In one embodiment a condition that triggers the desirability to at least partially disable the vending apparatus may occur and the timing of actually disabling the vending apparatus may occur anytime afterwards e.g. after a current vend is completed as opposed to prohibiting the current vend to complete . The condition may be the detection by the article ID device that an unauthorized good has been detected and the at least partial disablement may be prohibiting further vending from the corresponding compartment .

It is noted that an unscrupulous party may be motivated to attempt to alter the nature of the vending apparatus such that it will not at least partially disable in accordance with the invention as described in the embodiments herein. For example if the function of partly or fully disabling the vending apparatus is carried out by way of a software program running on the microprocessor platform of the control system as discussed above then an unscrupulous party may seek to remove the control system from the vending apparatus and replace it with a substitute control system that does not disable the vending apparatus .

In order to thwart the unauthorized modification of the vending apparatus the vending apparatus preferably includes at least one of an electronic an electromechanical and or a mechanical means for sensing whether an unauthorized modification of the vending apparatus has occurred and if so at least partially disabling the vending apparatus from dispensing goods. With reference to one or more of the control system A and or the peripheral systems circuits preferably include an electronic security circuit that is operatively coupled to or in operative communication with a receiving circuit such that unauthorized removal of the system circuit having the electronic security circuit may be sensed by the receiving circuit. The electronic security circuit maybe implemented using substantially the same technology presented hereinabove with respect to sensing unauthorized removal and or modification of the panel the control system the peripheral systems circuits etc. The electronic security circuits preferably communicate with other portions of and or one integrated into the vending apparatus i.e. receiving circuits such as power supplies motors wire harnesses switches encoders the customer display the bill acceptor mechanism the coin acceptor mechanism the coin return actuator the credit debit card reader mechanism the keypad mechanism the article ID device one or more of the position sensors the communications unit the vacuum unit the retrieving device drivers and or any other electronic and or electromechanical device of the vending apparatus . For example if a given component with an electronic security circuit is altered and or removed then any one or more of the components with a receiving circuit which may be another electronic security circuit may cease to operate. Thus for example a motor may refuse to operate in response to a control system that does not include an expected electronic security circuit .

Advantageously when a vending apparatus employs one or more of the electronic security circuits an unscrupulous person seeking to alter the vending apparatus would need to replace every component of the vending apparatus that includes an electronic security circuit and or any receiving circuit with which they communicate. This would make it highly impractical for the party to alter the vending apparatus in an unauthorized way.

Reference is now made to which illustrates a process flow for the vending apparatus in accordance with one or more further aspects of the present invention. Preferably the process is carried out using the control system it being most preferred that the process is executed by way of a software program running on the microprocessor platform. At action the vending apparatus is preferably operating in at least a partially enabled state such that at least some of the goods stored within the vending apparatus may be dispensed to a user. At action an inquiry is preferably made as to whether a disable code has been received by the vending apparatus . If the result of the inquiry is negative then the process preferably flows back to action where the vending apparatus is permitted to remain in the enabled state. If however the result of the inquiry is positive then the process flow preferably advances to action where the vending apparatus is preferably at least partially disabled e.g. such that at least some of the goods stored within the vending apparatus may not be dispensed therefrom . The specific mechanisms that are preferably used to disable the vending apparatus have been discussed above and will not be repeated here.

The disable code is preferably an electronic code that is input into the vending apparatus through at least one of i the keypad mechanism ii a dedicated keypad not shown that may be available for example only by opening the door of the vending apparatus iii a portable computing device not shown that is operable to connect to the communications unit e.g. through a data port or the like and iv a communications network to which the vending apparatus is connected e.g. through the communications unit . Whenr a communications network is employed to input the disable code into the vending apparatus the communications network may include for example at least one of a wire network a telephone network a radio frequency link an infrared link a local area network a wide area network the Internet etc.

It is noted that the disable code may be subject to cryptography such that a decryption algorithm is employed within the vending apparatus e.g. in the control system to decode the disable code. This would provide a high level of confidence that only authentic disable codes may be utilized to disable the vending apparatus .

Advantageously the control process illustrated in is useful in encouraging one or more entities to enter into agreements with one another concerning sales of goods from the vending apparatus or a plurality of vending apparatus . These agreements may be substantially similar to those discussed hereinabove with respect to . In general however in accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention the entities preferably agree that i the vending apparatus may be enabled to dispense the goods and ii the vending apparatus may be at least partially disabled from dispensing at least some of the goods when an externally generated disable code is received by the vending apparatus . More particularly the entities may agree that the disable code may be made available to the vending apparatus after a determination is made that at least one contractual obligation between the entities has not been at least one of satisfied and waived.

It is noted that the discussion hereinabove with respect to the details concerning the various contractual obligations the prescribed data concerning sales of goods by the vending apparatus the limitations under which the vending apparatus may vend goods the mechanisms and or processes used to disable the vending apparatus the flow of information between various entities apply equally here. Indeed these details apply to the control process illustrated in FIG. the capabilities of the vending apparatus the methods carried out by the vending apparatus and or the relationships between the entities having an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus . Accordingly these details will not be repeated here. For example the general and specific examples of the relationships and communication between entities with an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus presented above with respect to apply here although it is understood that the disable code is communicated instead of or in addition to the continuation code etc. It is noted that further examples of the relationships and communications among entities with an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus are presented later in this description with reference to .

Reference is now made to which illustrates a process flow for the vending apparatus in accordance with one or more further aspects of the present invention. Preferably the process is carried out using the control system it being most preferred that the process is executed by way of a software program running on the microprocessor platform. At action the vending apparatus is preferably operating in at least a partially enabled state such that at least some of the goods stored within the vending apparatus may be dispensed to a user. At action an inquiry is preferably made as to whether a predefined condition has occurred that justifies at least partially disabling the vending apparatus e.g. such that at least some of the goods stored within the vending apparatus may not be dispensed therefrom . If the result of the inquiry is negative then the process preferably flows back to action where the vending apparatus is permitted to remain in the enabled state. If however the result of the inquiry is positive then the process flow preferably advances to action where the vending apparatus is preferably at least partially disabled.

It is noted that action may be carried out by generating an internal disable signal or code within the vending apparatus . Details concerning examples of the mechanisms and or processes to disable the vending apparatus e.g. using an internal disable signal have been presented above in this description. By way of example the control system may be operable to determine whether the predefined condition exists and cause the disabling of the vending apparatus as discussed hereinabove. It is further noted that the invention contemplates a process flow that includes actions and and that does not require but that may include any further actions.

The predefined condition at action preferably includes at least one of i that one or more limitations under which the vending apparatus vends the goods are violated ii that one or more of contractual obligations into which entities have entered have not been satisfied or waived iii that the vending apparatus receives an externally generated disable code and iv that the vending apparatus reaches an end of a predefined interval without having received a continuation code. The preferred mechanisms and or processes that are employed by the vending apparatus and any external systems or entities to determine whether one or more limitations and or contractual obligations have been violated have been discussed in detail hereinabove and apply equally here. The vending apparatus preferably is operable to at least partially disable action if these determinations are affirmative if the externally generated disable code is received and or if a continuation code is not received in a timely manner. The preferred mechanisms and or processes by which the vending apparatus disables have been discussed in detail above and apply equally here.

At action an inquiry is preferably made as to whether a re enable code has been received by the vending apparatus . If the result of the inquiry is negative then the process preferably flows back to action where the vending apparatus remains in the at least partially disabled state. If however the result of the inquiry is positive then the process flow preferably flows back to action where the vending apparatus is permitted to enter the enabled state e.g. such that at least some of the goods stored within the vending apparatus may be dispensed therefrom .

The re enable code is preferably an electronic code that is input into the vending apparatus via at least one of i the keypad mechanism ii a dedicated keypad not shown that may be available for example only by opening the door of the vending apparatus iii a portable computing device not shown that is operable to connect to the communications unit e.g. through a data port or the like and iv a communications network to which the vending apparatus is connected e.g. through the communications unit .

The microprocessor of the control system is preferably operable to receive the re enable code to determine its authenticity and to cause the reverse of the disable condition of the vending apparatus . It is noted that the re enable code may be subject to cryptography such that a decryption algorithm is employed within the vending apparatus e.g. in the control system to decode the re enable code. This would provide a high level of confidence that only authentic re enable codes may be utilized to re enable the vending apparatus .

Advantageously the control process illustrated in is useful in encouraging one or more entities to enter into agreements with one another concerning sales of goods from the vending apparatus or a plurality of vending apparatus . These agreements may be substantially similar to those discussed hereinabove with respect to . In general however in accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention the entities preferably agree that i the vending apparatus may be enabled to dispense the goods ii the vending apparatus may be at least partially disabled from dispensing at least some of the goods when the predefined condition has occurred and iii the vending apparatus may be at least partially re enabled by receiving a re enable code after having been at least partially disabled.

It is noted that the discussion hereinabove with respect to the details concerning the various contractual obligations the prescribed data concerning sales of goods by the vending apparatus the limitations under which the vending apparatus may vend goods the mechanisms and or processes used to disable the vending apparatus the flow of information between various entities apply equally here. Indeed these details apply to the control process illustrated in the capabilities of the vending apparatus the methods carried out by the vending apparatus and or the relationships between the entities having an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus . For example the general and specific examples of the relationships and communication between entities with an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus presented above with respect to apply here although it is understood that the re enable code is communicated instead of or in addition to the continuation and or disable codes etc. It is noted that further examples of the relationships and communications among entities with an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus are presented later in this description with reference to .

Reference is now made to which is a high level block diagram illustrating data functional co operational etc. communication among the vending apparatus one or more entities and one or more central data centers over a network . Any of the known techniques may be employed to facilitate communication over the network where the network may be any one or more of a wire network a telephone network a radio frequency link an infrared link a local area network a wide area network the Internet etc.

It is noted that the central data center may be under the custody and or control of any one or more authorized ones of the entities with an interest in the sales of goods as discussed above. It is contemplated however that not all entities have authority to alter any control program under which the control data center operates.

The central data center preferably includes a network server a data base server a database a processor and a bus providing cooperative communication therebetween and or the functional equivalents thereof . It is noted that the central data center may be implemented utilizing any computer system such as a hand held computer or computers a lap top computer or computers distributed computers desktop computers etc. The network server may employ any of the known technology for facilitating communication over the network . It is understood that the vending apparatus or other entities may employ a network server similar to the network server to facilitate communication over the network . The database server preferably is operable to facilitate manage and maintain any data stored within and or retrieved from the database . Any of the known database server technologies may be employed to implement the database server . The processor is preferably operable to facilitate overall control manipulation reception transmission etc. of the data to and from the central data center .

Preferably the central data center receives data concerning the sales of goods and or any data released from the vending apparatus where the data is monitored stored and released by the vending apparatus .

With reference to and in accordance with one or more further aspects of the present invention the vending apparatus preferably includes various capabilities actions and or functions associated with one or more of monitoring the data concerning sales of goods storing the data and releasing the data to interested parties such as the central data center . To this end the vending apparatus is preferably operable to carry out the process flow illustrated in for example utilizing the control system and one or more of the peripheral circuits and or systems discussed hereinabove and shown in .

At action the vending apparatus preferably monitors data concerning the sales of goods therefrom. For example the microprocessor of the control system preferably communicates with one or more of the user interface system e.g. the bill acceptor mechanism the coin acceptor mechanism the coin return actuator the coin return well the credit debit card reader mechanism and or the keypad mechanism the a communications unit the article ID device and or the one or more position sensors to collect data therefrom. The data may include for example i information concerning vending or attempts at vending unauthorized goods ii information concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus obtained for example using the article ID device and iii information concerning any limitations under which the vending apparatus vends the goods. The preferred mechanisms and or processes utilized by the vending apparatus to monitor this and other data have been discussed hereinabove and apply equally here.

In accordance with one or more further aspects of the present invention at action the vending apparatus preferably monitors a first selection of goods made by a user of the vending apparatus . At action the vending apparatus preferably determines whether the first selection of goods is out of inventory. If the result of the determination is negative action then the process preferably flows back to action where the vending apparatus again monitors a first selection of goods for example by the same user or a subsequent user. If however the result of the determination is affirmative action the process flow preferably advances to action where the vending apparatus monitors a second selection of goods made by the user e.g. where the second selection of goods was made by the user because the first selection of goods was out of inventory. It is noted that this information may be of particular interest to one or more entities interested in knowing marketing information concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . For example a seller of goods may be particularly interested in knowing what subsequent choices users would make if a particular article was not available from the vending apparatus .

It is noted that although actions through illustrate a preferred process flow they need not be implemented and indeed the process flow may advance from action to without passing through actions .

At action the data monitored by the vending apparatus are at least temporarily stored e.g. within the memory . At action the vending apparatus preferably releases the data to an interested and or authorized party such as the central data center . Alternatively the vending apparatus may release the data to for example a portable computing device connected to the communications unit of the vending apparatus . It is noted that the flow of data among the vending apparatus and one or more interested parties may be consistent with the data flows of the embodiments discussed hereinabove that reference . Preferably the data that are released from the vending apparatus are encrypted as will be presented in detail later in this description.

The preferred data that the vending apparatus is capable of monitoring has been discussed in detail above. These data include the prescribed data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus the limitations under which the vending apparatus vends the goods the contractual obligations etc. For example the vending apparatus is preferably operable to monitor information concerning vending or attempts at vending unauthorized goods. This information whether in final data form or in raw data form preferably includes for example data concerning whether at least one of i only goods of an authorized type are vended ii only goods of an authorized brand are vended iii only goods of an authorized size are vended iv only goods of an authorized weight are vended v only goods of an authorized expiration date are vended vi only goods of an authorized package type are vended vii only good of an authorized period of manufacture are vended and viii only goods of an authorized place of manufacture are vended. The information may also concern a number of times that unauthorized goods were vended or that attempts were made at vending unauthorized goods. Any other data may also be collected.

By way of further example when the vending apparatus is operable to monitor information concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus obtained using the article ID device the information preferably includes at least one of a type of goods a brand of goods a size of goods a weight of goods an expiration date of goods a package type of goods a period of manufacture of goods and a place of manufacture of goods.

As discussed above the data monitored by the vending apparatus may include raw data e.g. a price of a vended article a date of sale of the article a time of sale of the article etc. Preferably the vending apparatus is operable to compute additional or final data concerning the sales of goods based on the raw data. Many examples of such calculations have been discussed hereinabove and apply equally here. For example the vending apparatus is preferably operable to calculate a quantum of one or more types of goods sold during one or more prescribed periods of time. To this end one skilled in the art will appreciate from the disclosure herein that for example the control system and the microprocessor in particular may be operable to monitor the quanta of a particular type of goods sold and monitor an interval of time e.g. the prescribed period of time of interest such that the number of articles of the particular type sold during the prescribed period of time may be calculated. It will be appreciated that the particular data monitored and or calculated by the vending apparatus are vast and that any particular variation is contemplated by and is within the scope of the invention.

With reference to the data that the central data center receives over the network concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus preferably includes at least some of the data monitored by the vending apparatus as discussed above. For example these data preferably include at least one of i information concerning vending or attempts at vending unauthorized goods from the vending apparatus ii information concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus obtained using a goods identification scanning device e.g. the article ID device of the vending apparatus iii information concerning any limitations under which the vending apparatus vends the goods and iv information concerning a user s second selection of goods from the vending apparatus in response to the user s first selection of goods being out of inventory in the vending apparatus .

It is noted that details concerning this data and or other data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus were discussed hereinabove with respect to and apply equally here concerning the data that the central data center receives over the network . This includes that the central data center may receive raw data concerning sales of goods and or any other data from the vending apparatus as discussed above. Preferably the central data center is operable to compute additional or final data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus based on the raw data. Such processing is preferably carried out by the processor of the central data center . Thus for example if the vending apparatus does not compute the final data and releases raw data to the central computer the processor preferably computes the final data. Various illustrative examples of such computations have been discussed above and apply equally here.

Preferably the database has information concerning at least one of the contractual obligations the limitations on how goods are vended etc. such that the central data center may receive prescribed data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus and the processor may determine whether one or more obligations among entities with an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus have been met based on the prescribed data. Various illustrative examples of the mechanisms and or processes for making such determinations have been discussed above with respect to the vending apparatus which apply equally here.

Further the central data center is preferably operable to generate and or make the continuation code the disable code and or the re enable code available to the vending apparatus . The preferred mechanisms and or processes for generating or making these codes available to the vending apparatus have been described in detail above and apply equally here.

Preferably the central data center is further operable to facilitate the computation and or distribution of revenue from the vending apparatus and or other entities among the interested entities in accordance with agreed to processes and protocols.

Preferably the data received by and or released from the central data center has been encrypted such that advantageous authentication of the data may be performed. Further details concerning the encryption decryption and authentication of data by the vending apparatus and or the central computer are presented later in this description.

The central data center preferably releases at least some of the data that it receives over the network and or calculates e.g. using the processor to at least one interested party such as one or more of the entities . Preferably the central data center requires that the interested party provide an authorization code prior to releasing the data. It is noted that the interested party may include one or more of the manufacturer of the vending apparatus the operator the seller of goods the lender the lessor the owner of property etc.

Thus an interested entity may obtain valuable information from the central data center concerning the sale of goods from the vending apparatus . For example if the central data center is operable to perform one or more of the actions discussed above with respect to an interested party e.g. the seller of goods may be able to obtain information concerning what subsequent choices users would make if a particular article was not available from the vending apparatus . Alternatively an interested entity may obtain information concerning any limitations under which the vending apparatus vends the goods e.g. to verify that they are authorized . Advantageously this permits entities to obtain information concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus without the need to physically inspect the vending apparatus either directly or through a representative .

As discussed hereinabove at least some of the apparatus and methods of the invention rely on data obtained at the vending apparatus and provided to an interested entity. Some entities may not be comfortable with entering into certain relationships with other entities concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus without assurances that the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus may be relied upon. For example if an operator and a seller have entered into an agreement in which the operator is obliged to sell a prescribed quantity of the seller s goods through the vending apparatus then the seller of goods would be interested in authenticating the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . Indeed the seller of goods may be concerned that the operator may attempt to alter the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus to benefit himself and to the detriment of the seller of goods . Advantageously the vending apparatus in accordance with one or more aspects of the present invention is operable to produce ciphertext from the data concerning the sale of goods therefrom such that e.g. the seller of goods may be confident that the data received are accurate.

Reference is now made to which is a flow diagram illustrating a process that is preferably carried out by the vending apparatus in accordance with one or more further aspects of the present invention. It is preferred that the process is implemented utilizing the control system where a software program provides instructions to the microprocessor . Preferably action is substantially similar to action of and the discussion hereinabove with respect thereto applies equally here. Accordingly the details of the preferred mechanisms and or processes for the monitoring of data by the vending apparatus concerning sales of goods will not be repeated. At action the data monitored by the vending apparatus are preferably at least temporarily stored e.g. within the memory .

At action the vending apparatus preferably encrypts at least some of the data concerning the sales of goods and at action the encrypted data is preferably released from the vending apparatus to an interested and or authorized party. The vending apparatus may release the data directly to the interested party to one or more intermediate parties and or to an intermediate device such as a portable computing device connected to the communications unit of the vending apparatus . It is noted that the flow of data among the vending apparatus and the one or more interested parties may be consistent with the data flows of the embodiments discussed hereinabove that reference and . Accordingly a detailed discussion of the flow of such data will not be repeated here.

The encryption algorithm employed at action may be any of the known cryptographic algorithms such as those involving transposition substitution polyalphabetic substitution conventional key encryption public key encryption cipher systems code systems etc. For example with reference to the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus may be subject to an encryption algorithm in which a secret key is utilized to encrypt the data and produce so called ciphertext e.g. text in which the data can not be discerned without a decryption key . Advantageously the one or more interested parties may receive the ciphertext and utilize the same to authenticate the data contained therein. For example the one or more interested parties may be privy to the decryption key which when input into a substantially similar encryption algorithm along with the ciphertext yields the original data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . This provides the interested party with a high degree of confidence that the data are authentic and worthy of reliance.

In some circumstances it is preferred that the vending apparatus is operable to produce the ciphertext in a way that cannot be decrypted without a non public e.g. secret decryption key e.g. . In this way an entity that is not privy to the non public decryption key cannot decrypt the ciphertext and gain access to the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus .

With reference to other circumstances may dictate that an entity that is not privy to the non public decryption key may nevertheless have a need to gain access to the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . For example this entity may need the data to meet its obligations to one or more other entities. These other entities may be privy to the non public decryption key. By way of example an operator may be obligated to provide a share of the total sales from the vending apparatus to a seller of goods. Thus the operator would need access to the total sales data to compute the share. Such total sales data however may be encrypted into ciphertext such that the seller of goods can authenticate the total sales data. Thus the vending apparatus may be operable to produce the ciphertext in a way that may be decrypted utilizing both a public decryption key and a non public decryption key.

To that end and with reference to the encryption algorithm produces ciphertext in accordance with a non public e.g. secret encryption key that may be decrypted utilizing algorithm A and a public key. Thus for example the operator may monitor the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus and take appropriate actions to ensure that he meets his obligations to the seller of goods. Furthermore another entity that is privy to the non public e.g. secret decryption key e.g. the seller of goods may authenticate the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus utilizing algorithm B and the secret decryption key.

In order to assist in authenticating the data contained in the ciphertext the ciphertext preferably includes some known data e.g. an identification number a vending apparatus identification number a date a time a sequence number a vending apparatus location number etc. . The entity that is privy to the secret decryption key may search the decrypted ciphertext to determine whether the known data is included. If it is then that entity may have a high degree of confidence that the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus are authentic and have not been tampered with.

In accordance with alternative aspects of the present invention and with reference to the vending apparatus may be operable to encrypt the data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus in such a way that the vending data are substantially unaltered by an encryption algorithm . The vending apparatus may produce a digital signature by encrypting the vending data and other known data using algorithm and a secret encryption key. The digital signature may only be decrypted utilizing a non public decryption key. Thus one or more entities e.g. the operator may utilize the vending data to carry out various actions including meeting his or her obligations while one or more other entities e.g. the seller of goods may decrypt the digital signature to authenticate the vending data.

In accordance with one or more further alternative aspects of the apparatus and methods of the present invention the vending apparatus may be operable to produce a code associated with at least some of the data concerning sales of goods. The code need not be produced using encryption but preferably provides an indication as to whether the data have been tampered with. For example the vending apparatus may insert the vending data into an electronic file and the code may indicate a number of times that the electronic file has been opened. If the code indicates that the electronic file has never been opened then an entity receiving the electronic file and the code may reasonably assume that the data have not been tampered with. Preferably when the data are stored at least temporarily within the vending apparatus action the storage is preferably carried out in a secure manner so that the data may not be tampered with prior to being inserted into the electronic file and or prior to being released from the vending apparatus .

It will be appreciated from the discussion thus far that many relationships may be established among the entities with an interest in the sale of goods from the vending apparatus or a plurality of such vending apparatus and that many forms and paths for communicating various data among the entities may be employed in accordance with the invention. Some general and specific examples of these relationships communication paths and data exchanges have been presented above e.g. with reference to . Some further illustrative examples of these relationships communication paths and data exchanges will now be presented. Any or all of the entities in the descriptions below may each use one or more computer systems to enable communication among them to carry out the communication of data as described herein.

With reference to an example is illustrated of one or more relationships and communications between the seller of goods and the authorized third party e.g. an asset and data management company ADMC . In this example the ADMC performs functions and actions that assist the seller of goods in enjoying the financial benefits of the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . For example the seller of goods may have an agreement e.g. via contract with the operator not shown such that mutual financial benefits may be enjoyed by both parties. As was discussed in detail hereinabove rules relating to vending e.g. specific rules guiding the limitations under which the vending apparatus vends the goods are preferably established by way of the contractual agreement between the seller of goods and the operator.

The ADMC is preferably privy to prescribed data concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus e.g. as discussed above with respect to . The ADMC preferably provides at least some of the prescribed data to the seller of goods such that the seller of goods may determine for itself whether the agreed to rules concerning limitations on vending are being followed and therefore whether the contractual obligations between the seller of goods and for example the operator are being met. Preferably the prescribed data are authenticated by the ADMC using for example the encryption mechanisms and or processes discussed hereinabove with respect to . Alternatively the ADMC may itself determine whether compliance with the rules concerning limitations on vending exists and supply rule compliance data to the seller of goods . Advantageously this alleviates the burden on the seller of goods from making such determinations and permits it to focus on other matters.

The seller of goods may provide the ADMC with agreement control information such as the conditions under which a continuation code a disable code a limitation modification code and or a re enable code should be made available to the vending apparatus . This agreement control information may also include the authorization to generate and or make the codes available to the vending apparatus thereby providing the seller of goods with leverage to ensure that the operator complies with the limiting rules regarding vending and further complies with its contractual obligations. It is noted that these conditions concerning disabling the vending apparatus are preferably established during the process of negotiating the agreement between the seller of goods and the operator. 

The seller of goods also preferably provides the ADMC with information concerning the contractual obligations that should be followed concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . These contractual obligations are preferably defined by the agreement between the seller of goods and the operator and may include for example information concerning any revenue sharing between the operator and the seller of goods . Since the ADMC is privy to the prescribed data concerning for example sales of goods from the vending apparatus it may compute revenue shares and facilitate the distribution of such shares e.g. payments to the seller of goods and or any other entities.

With reference to the information concerning the contractual obligations provided to the ADMC may include information relating to providing payments to the vending machine manufacturer . These contractual obligations may be defined by for example a separate agreement between the seller of goods and the vending machine manufacturer and or an agreement between the operator and the vending machine manufacturer . In order to provide the vending machine manufacturer with at least some leverage to obtain such payments the ADMC may need to receive data from the vending machine manufacturer to generate and or cause the generation of the disable control information e.g. the continuation codes the disable codes the re enable codes etc. for the vending apparatus . Such data may include the serial number of the vending apparatus or any other such machine specific information. Advantageously if the vending machine manufacturer does not receive its payments it may withhold the data and prevent for example continuation codes from being made available to the vending apparatus .

With reference to the ADMC may also communicate with yet another entity such as a financial institution a lender a lessor etc. hereinafter financial institution . More specifically the ADMC may communicate rule compliance information and or other data to the financial institution relating to whether another of the entities e.g. the operator is in compliance with the terms of an agreement. As discussed above the financial institution may have an agreement with for example the operator concerning a sale lease loan etc. of the vending apparatus to the operator. Thus the financial institution may expect to receive payments from the operator e.g. fixed payments and or payments dependent on sales of goods from the vending apparatus . The financial institution may provide the terms of the sale loan lease etc. to the ADMC such that the ADMC may determine compliance by the operator. Therefore in this example the ADMC is acting as an agent for the financial institution by releasing codes e.g. continuation codes etc. to the operator as per the agreement between the operator and the financial institution . Advantageously the ADMC may simply provide an indication to the financial institution as to whether compliance with the sale loan lease etc. has been met.

With reference to the above discussion concerning the relationships among the seller of goods the ADMC the vending apparatus manufacturer and the financial institution hinges at least to some extent on whether the vending machine operator provides or causes prescribed data e.g. concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus to be provided to the ADMC . The prescribed data may include for example rule compliance information sales data etc. The vending machine operator may be motivated to provide this data to the ADMC when he or she must rely on whether the vending apparatus receives disable control information such as continuation codes disable codes re enable codes etc. in order to obtain financial benefits from the vending apparatus .

With reference to an alternative example is illustrated of relationships communications and data exchanges between various entities concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . In this example the seller of goods and the vending machine operator have entered into an agreement concerning the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . In addition the vending machine operator and the vending machine manufacturer have entered into an agreement concerning for example the sale or lease of the vending apparatus to the vending machine operator . While the seller of goods may be privy to the limiting rules under which the vending apparatus vends goods by way of the negotiations with the vending machine operator the seller of goods preferably receives the terms of the agreement between the vending machine manufacturer and the vending machine operator as illustrated by line .

The seller of goods utilizes the terms of its agreement with the vending machine operator and the terms of the agreement between the vending machine manufacturer and the vending machine operator to formulate a set of limiting rules under which the vending apparatus must vend the goods including any disable conditions . These rules are communicated to the vending machine operator and or directly to the vending machine apparatus as illustrated by line .

The vending machine operator or vending apparatus needs information and or must avoid receiving certain information from the vending machine manufacturer in order to ensure that the vending apparatus is capable of vending the goods such as continuation codes disable codes re enable codes etc. as illustrated by line . To receive and or avoid this information however the vending machine operator must provide prescribed data concerning the sale of goods from the vending apparatus which may include rule compliance information sales data etc. to the seller of goods . Further the operator may be required to provide other information and or payments to the vending machine manufacturer as prescribed by the agreement therebetween.

In turn the seller of goods may provide compliance information e.g. concerning the terms of the agreement between the manufacturer and the operator and or the terms of the agreement between the operator and the seller of goods to the vending machine manufacturer as illustrated by line . The vending machine manufacturer may ensure that it receives such compliance information by for example releasing disable control information e.g. the continuation codes disable codes re enable codes etc. to the vending machine operator and or to the vending apparatus directly only when it receives the compliance information and or only when compliance exists. It is noted that compliance may involve fulfillment of both agreements i.e. between the seller of goods and the operator and between the vending machine manufacturer and the operator .

With reference to a further example is illustrated of relationships communications and data exchanges among the vending machine operator the seller of goods and the financial institution . The relationship communication and data exchange between the vending machine operator and the seller of goods may be for example substantially similar to those described above with respect to . In the example illustrated in the vending machine operator also enters into an agreement with the financial institution dictating the sale loan or lease of the vending apparatus . The terms of this agreement are communicated to the seller of goods as illustrated by line . The terms of this agreement may dictate that the vending machine operator provide payments to the financial institution which may be fixed and or dependent on the sale of goods from the vending apparatus as illustrated by line A.

In order to ensure that the financial institution receives its payments and the seller of goods receives any financial benefits defined by its agreement with the vending machine operator the financial institution may release for example continuation codes re enable codes disable codes etc. to the vending machine operator and or the vending apparatus directly as illustrated by line A. Thus the financial institution may withhold the continuation codes if for example it does not receive payments from the vending machine operator and or if the compliance information line provided by the seller of goods indicates that the seller of goods is not receiving its financial benefits from the vending machine operator .

With reference to a further example is illustrated of relationships communications and data exchanges among the vending machine operator the ADMC and one or more of the vending machine manufacturer and the financial institution . In this example certain responsibilities and burdens are shifted from the seller of goods and or the vending machine manufacturer and or the financial institution as compared with the previous examples discussed hereinabove. For example the ADMC receives prescribed data concerning the sale of goods from the vending apparatus line and preferably makes a determination of the propriety of releasing disable control information for example continuation codes to the vending machine operator and or directly to the vending apparatus as illustrated by line .

By way of example the vending machine operator may have entered into an agreement with the vending machine manufacturer or financial institution concerning the sale and or lease of the vending apparatus which agreement may prescribe that the vending machine operator provide payments to the vending machine manufacturer or financial institution . It is noted that these payments may be fixed or subject to the sales of goods from the vending apparatus . Information concerning the terms of this agreement may be communicated to the ADMC as illustrated by line . The vending manufacturer or financial institution may provide information to the ADMC as to compliance by the vending machine operator in making the prescribed payments as illustrated by line . Advantageously the vending machine manufacturer may ensure that it receives such prescribed payments from the vending machine operator because the ADMC may for example withhold the continuation codes from the vending machine operator if such payments are not made.

With reference to a further example is illustrated of one or more relationships communications and data exchanges among the vending machine operator the seller of goods and the ADMC . One skilled in the art will appreciate that many of the details concerning the relationships communications and data exchanges may be readily determined in light of the previous examples presented hereinabove with respect to and will not be repeated here. It is noted however that the example shown in contemplates an agreement between the seller of goods and the vending machine operator that dictates that the vending machine operator provide certain prescribed data to the seller of goods in order to partially or fully comply with the terms of the agreement. Such data may include for example information concerning the habits and or preferences of users of the vending apparatus for example what a user s next choice is likely to be when the user s first choice of goods is not in inventory in the vending apparatus . Advantageously the mechanisms and or processes contemplated by the example of ensure that the seller of goods receives such prescribed data from the vending machine operator . Indeed if the vending machine operator fails to provide such prescribed data in accordance with its obligations the seller of goods may authorize the ADMC to for example withhold the continuation codes line from the vending machine operator thereby preventing him from enjoying the financial benefits of the vending apparatus .

With reference to one skilled in the art will appreciate from the disclosure herein that many variations and modifications on the relationships communication paths data exchanges etc. illustrated hereinabove with respect to and the other figures and discussions in this description may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In the example illustrated in the relationships communications data exchanges etc. discussed hereinabove with respect to have been combined. It is noted that in this example the vending machine operator must rely on receiving information or avoiding receiving information such as continuation codes re enable codes disable codes etc. from two entities namely the financial institution and the ADMC in order to enjoy the financial benefits of the vending apparatus . The agreements among these entities may be set up such that at least one or both of the sources of disable code information must be received e.g. when the information includes continuation codes or avoided e.g. when the information includes disable codes in order to ensure that the vending apparatus is capable of vending goods. In this way multiple entities may be ensured that the vending machine operator complies with its contractual obligation with them.

With reference to a further example is illustrated of relationships communications data exchanges etc. among the operator seller of goods ADMC the vending machine manufacturer and the financial institution . One skilled in the art will appreciate that this example is comprised of a combination of the examples illustrated in and and therefore a repeat of details already discussed hereinabove with respect to those figures will not be made here. It is noted however that the entities may ensure that compliance with the one or more agreements may be ensured by way of for example one source of disable control information line that may include continuation codes re enable codes disable codes etc. Indeed the advantages of employing the ADMC as a central hub for information and control is apparent in that compliance of many contractual obligations among the entities may be ensured by way of a single source e.g. the ADMC of the disable control information.

Further embodiments and aspects of the invention are described next and are applicable to supplement those embodiments of the invention described in the above text and Figures. Accordingly the below text is intended to be read in conjunction with the Figures used to illustrate the foregoing methods and apparatus.

In accordance with one aspect the present invention relates to methods of doing business and more particularly relates to methods of doing the business of machine vending. In its most immediate sense this aspect of the invention relates to methods of doing machine vending using a computerized vending machine or CVM such as is disclosed in the above referenced patent applications.

Existing methods of doing business using vending machines and indeed existing contractual relationships that relate to such machines are based upon a conventional vending machines of the self standing type.

In such methods and relationships an operator of the machine this may be an owner or lessee of the machine sites the machine at a particular location controlled by a person having an interest in the real property at that location the landlord . For the purposes of this invention the landlord may own the property may be a lessee or a real estate agent. And the landlord need not be different from the operator . The operator contracts with a seller of goods e.g. the manufacturer of snack foods which usually is but need not necessarily be different from the operator or the landlord that are loaded into the machine. When a purchaser purchases goods from the machine he or she makes a payment to the machine and gets the goods in return. The operator periodically collects the money and pays the landlord and the manufacturer. If the owner is a lessee or has purchased the machine with financing provided by a lender then the owner will also pay the lender e.g. a bank from the money collected from the machine.

Heretofore the contractual relationships between these parties have been independent of the actual operations carried out by the machine. For example the landlord will charge the operator rent based e.g. upon the location and size of the place where the machine is located and the cost of providing electricity to operate the machine. So too the lender will charge the operator a sum that is related to the amount loaned to the operator and to whatever interest rate currently applies. Likewise the manufacturer will charge the operator a price related to the quantity and nature of the goods the operator elects to purchase.

Such relatively simple contracts are different from those used in analogous retail situations. For example a store in a shopping center will conventionally pay the landlord a negotiated percentage of its sales. Such a pay as you go arrangement can be highly beneficial for both parties since they can share the risks and rewards of the business and can adjust the share to correspond to e.g. the financial status of the tenant.

Such arrangements have not been practical for vending machines. This is because such machines must be physically visited by persons who e.g. remove cash from them and such persons cannot easily be supervised by third parties such as banks or landlords. Furthermore operators can and do change the product offerings of the machines to better match the wants of the persons who purchase items from them and it would be very difficult for e.g. a bank or a landlord to know exactly what goods were loaded into a particular machine at any particular time.

Operators landlords manufacturers and lenders would all benefit from contractual relationships wherein payments related to vending machines would depend upon actual operations carried out by the machine i.e. would depend upon e.g. the number types and prices of items sold from the machine the time of day that the machine was most often used sales data collected by the machine etc.

Accordingly an object of the invention is to provide a method of doing business wherein persons could receive payments based on actual operations carried out a vending machine.

Another object of the invention is to provide a method of doing business wherein a person who is in physical possession of such a machine may be deprived of some or all of the economic benefits of the machine without the need to physically take the machine away from the person in possession of it.

The invention proceeds from the realization that a CVM can be provided with computer intelligence sufficient to wholly or partly reversibly disable operation of the CVM or to re enable operation of the CVM again by timely inputting an authorization code or a deauthorization code and that the use of such a code will engender confidence in a third party that he or she will be properly paid. For example let it be assumed that a bank finances the operator s purchase of a CVM and the operator pays the bank every 30 days. The CVM will be programmed to automatically shut down at 30 day intervals. If the operator actually pays the bank then the bank will provide the operator with an authorization code that the operator can input to the CVM to keep the machine operating after the 30 days has passed. If the operator does not pay the bank then the CVM will automatically become disabled and the operator will derive no economic benefit from it. The lack of such economic benefit will then serve as an incentive for the operator to pay the bank. And the bank need not take physical possession of the CVM to achieve this result. The bank can wait until it is convenient to take physical possession.

Alternatively a lessor may lease the operator a CVM in accordance with a contract under which the operator pays the lessor 10 of the sales volume from the CVM every 30 days. The CVM can then be programmed to register the sales volume over each 30 day period and then to shut down automatically unless the operator inputs an authorization code provided by the lessor.

In yet another alternative let it be assumed that a landlord provides a large space for a bank of CVMs purchases or leases the CVMs and sites them there and engages an operator to run the CVMs in accordance with a contract under which the operator must pay the landlord 40 of the sales of the CVMs. After some time the landlord checks the sales of the CVMs and finds that the operator has been underpaying. The landlord can then input a deauthorization code to the CVMs to shut them down until the operator has settled its accounts with the landlord.

In still another alternative let it be assumed that a landlord provides a large space filled with CVMs hires staff to service the machines and sets different manufacturers in competition with each other to have their goods sold from the CVMs. In this example the landlord is also the owner. As stated above the landlord and owner just like the owner and manufacturer the manufacturer and landlord etc. can be the same or different. Each manufacturer contracts with the landlord to pay the landlord a rebate based on sales of the manufacturer s goods. If the manufacturer is late in paying the rebate the landlord can input a deauthorization code to prevent that manufacturer s goods from being sold until the manufacturer has settled accounts with the landlord.

One particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention is specifically adapted for use in a very common relationship between a manufacturer and an operator. In this common relationship the manufacturer provides a custom decorated vending machine to the operator. The vending machine is decorated with e.g. the manufacturer s logo and or housemark indicating that COCA COLA or PEPSI etc. can be purchased from the vending machine. Naturally when such a relationship exists the manufacturer and operator enter into contract wherein the operator is obliged to refrain from stocking the vending machine with goods made by a competing manufacturer.

In the CVM disclosed in at least one of the above referenced patent applications the CVM can be loaded with different types of goods and the front of the CVM has first and second regions. The manufacturer can supply the CVM with the manufacturer s logo housemark etc. in the first region and the operator can provide artwork for other goods in the second region.

With such an arrangement the operator and manufacturer can contract to provide e.g. that at least 80 measured by units sales in dollars or by whatever criterion the parties negotiate and verified by e.g. a barcode scanner in the CVM of the goods sold from the CVM will be manufactured by the manufacturer while allowing the operator the freedom to select the other 20 for which the operator can put corresponding artwork in the second region . If in actual operation of the CVM the negotiated percentage is not achieved then the CVM can be programmed to indicate that selected goods are unavailable preventing them from being sold and thereby increasing the percentage to the negotiated percentage.

In the CVM disclosed in at least one of the above referenced patent applications the CVM has a communications port permitting the CVM to be accessed by e.g. the Internet. In an especially advantageous embodiment of the invention an exclusive contract is established with a data management company that communicates with the CVM through the port and serves as a gateway for other firms that require such communication. The data management company can convey information about e.g. products purchased and dates and times of purchases to firms that can use such information and can also serve as a trusted intermediary so that the CVM is not subjected to conflicting authorization and deauthorization codes from different parties.

In accordance with yet another advantageous aspect of the invention the third party is paid at least partially by receipt of data. For example a food manufacturer may produce a new food snack item and may lack information about consumer acceptance of the item and the times and circumstances under which consumers are likely to purchase it. In such circumstances the manufacturer may provide the item to the operator at no charge but rather in accordance with a contract under which the operator must supply information regarding sales of the item at various prices and at various times of day and days of the week. Such information can aid the manufacturer to test market the new item and to determine consumer acceptance of the item at various price points. If the manufacturer does not receive the information the manufacturer can either withhold an authorization code or generate a deauthorization code and thereby prevent the operator from deriving a financial benefit by selling the item.

Alternatively the third party may be paid at least partially by receipt of contract rights. For example a manufacturer may produce a new food snack item and may purchase from the operator the right to have the item distributed from all the operator s CVMs but at various price points so as to conduct a controlled market test.

These different forms of payments need not be mutually exclusive a third party may for example receive a combination of currency and data.

A proper understanding of this invention requires a reconsideration of business arrangements that are traditionally made with respect to vending from machines. In one traditional arrangement an operator buys or leases a machine installs it at a landlord s premises and pays the landlord rent which may be a commission percentage . In such an arrangement the landlord must trust the honesty of the operator. While it is possible for the landlord to audit the operator s financial records the vending business is presently a cash based business and no party to a vending contract can be sure that all machine receipts are in fact recorded on the operator s books.

In another traditional arrangement a food or beverage manufacturer engages a vending machine manufacturer to make machines having product specific graphics so that a consumer can know e.g. that the machine dispenses PEPSI or FRITOS . This custom labeled machine is then sold or leased to an operator. In such an arrangement the food or beverage manufacturer seeks to prevent the operator from selling products other than those for which the custom labeled machine was originally intended and most of the time the food manufacturer must simply trust to the honesty of the operator. In some exceptional instances such machines can read the barcode information on the goods loaded into them and self destruct if the goods are not those the machine has been programmed to expect but this is an extreme and wasteful measure.

These traditional arrangements are necessarily simple and unsophisticated because inter alia it is not feasible for anyone other than the operator to interact with the vending machine.

However a CVM of the types mentioned above has sufficient intelligence to know e.g. the items stored in it the dates times and prices of sales the dates and times it is serviced and the identity of the person s servicing it etc. For example a CVM can use a laser scanner to read the barcode on an item stored in it and this information can be matched with information stored in the CVM. And information regarding the contents of the machine and the particulars of sales from the machine can be easily stored in the machine and outputted to a computer e.g. a laptop or a handheld in the hands of a service person or sent to a remote computer via a communications port that connects e.g. to the Internet . This makes it practical for persons other than the operator to have accurate information about the actual operations carried out by the CVM. This in turn makes it practical for parties to make contracts that would have been imprudent using older vending machine technology.

For example most landlords would have been unwilling to purchase banks of vending machines for use in e.g. company cafeterias. This is because the landlord would likely have to contract with an operator company to stock and service the machines and it would be very difficult for the landlord to be confident that the operator was not skimming cash that properly belonged to the landlord. However it would be feasible for a landlord to purchase or lease a bank of CVMs and to contract with a third party operator to stock and service them because the landlord would have recourse to the actual operations carried out by the CVM as a check on the honesty of the operator. In other words CVMs can practically be owned or leased by persons other than operators and CVMs make it practical to unbundle functions that formerly would have been carried out by operators alone. Hence it would be practical although not necessarily profitable for an operator to contract with a third party to stock and service CVMs that are remote from the operator s main geographical area.

Hence the availability of highly sophisticated CVMs makes it possible for parties to consider many different types of contracts that would have been considered imprudent using older vending machines. As used herein contract is used in its most general sense. The contract need not be written out. In general each party to such a contracts will likely fall into one or more of the following categories 

a person having an ownership interest e.g. title lease security interest right to operate in the CVM 

a person having an interest e.g. title lease possessory interest in real property where the CVM is located 

Although CVMs make it practical for parties to enter into different type of vending contracts they still require the ability to enforce self help measures if their contract partner does not adhere to the provisions of the contract. Usually but by no means always the self help measure is the entire or partial shutdown of the CVM. In many instances the CVM will shut down totally or partially by the automatic generation of a shut down signal. For example the CVM might shut down automatically upon 

c passage of a predetermined period of time between servicings to e.g. prevent stale goods in the CVM from being dispensed 

e sale of a predetermined sales volume of goods or of a predetermined sales volume within a predetermined period of time.

To prevent such a shutdown or to reverse such a shutdown if one has already occurred an authorization code is input to the CVM. Hence in accordance with an exemplary preferred embodiment of the invention a bank may contract with an operator to finance the operator s purchase or lease of a CVM. The CVM is programmed to shut down at noon on the last day of each month unless an authorization code is previously input to the CVM. If the bank receives payment it generates an authorization code that may be input to the CVM and that will prevent the next scheduled shutdown from taking place. The authorization code may be manually input to the CVM by the operator or electronically input to the CVM as via the Internet if the CVM has a communications port that permits this.

The shutdown of the CVM need not necessarily prevent all operation of the CVM. For example the CVM disclosed in at least one of the above referenced patent applications can distinguish between different goods loaded into it. It is possible for example to disable the CVM from dispensing only one or two items that have been loaded into it and to continue to dispense all the others until dispensing of the disabled goods is re permitted by input of an authorization code.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention the CVM does not automatically shut down in the absence of a timely input authorization code. Rather the CVM continues to operate until it is wholly or partially disabled upon receipt of a de authorization code. This would be preferred when for example each party recognizes that the other is a financially responsible entity that can ordinarily be depended upon to meet its financial obligations. In such a context shutdown should properly be an extraordinary remedy.

Accordingly in accordance with this aspect of the invention the third party issues the de authorization code or causes it to be issued and causes it to be input to the CVM which in turn causes the CVM to at least partially shut down.

In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention a data management company is engaged to serve as an electronic gateway having the exclusive right to communicate with the CVM through the communications port. This embodiment may be particularly advantageous when an operator enters into a contracts under which a plurality of manufacturers supply items for a single machine. For example if a CVM is capable of vending 40 items the data management company may acting as agent for the operator contract with five different manufacturers each supplying 8 items to be sold from the CVM. The data management company would e.g. administer the collection and input of the necessary authorization and deauthorization codes would prevent the CVM from receiving contradictory codes and would package and distribute data from the CVM for the benefit of the operator.

Although at least one preferred embodiment of these aspects of the invention have been described above this description is not limiting and is only exemplary.

Accordingly even further embodiments and aspects of the invention are described next which further embodiments are applicable to supplement those embodiments of the invention described above where such descriptions are not in conflict. Accordingly the below text is also intended to be read in conjunction with the foregoing text and Figures.

For example further aspects of the invention include a method of operation of apparatus for dispensing articles including some or all of the following 

An article ID device which can identify articles being dispensed from the machine can include a camera or a bar code scanner and can apply to other types of dispensing machines such as spiral machines food machines beverage machines 

Ability to disable dispensing of at least some of the articles stored therein in a predetermined fashion without the need for any communication or any disable code being input from any source external to the machine or its control system The control system is able to shut the machine down even if the whereabouts of the machine are unknown to an interested party 

Ability to re enable dispensing of articles when an authorization code is received and input into the machine. can be input by devices such as a keypad a modem a portable computer a wireless device a modem a memory storage device a telephone an intemet connection etc. 

A program memory for storing information relating to a limited number of article selections for example No more than 20 selections 

A program memory which contains defined information detailing the identity of products which are authorized to be dispensed. can also include ability to store the identity of products which are not authorized to be dispensed from the machine 

In one aspect of the invention any or all of the relevant parameters in the control system can be adjusted changed or eliminated by an authorized party. Many of these parameters are restrictions that can be used by one or more interested parties to enforce agreements and rules that the equipment will be governed by. These restrictions and changes thereto could include for example 

Adjusting the programming in the control system to allow a machine to disable in six month intervals up from one month intervals.

Changing the control system to disable the machine based on the amount of product sold instead of based on the amount of time elapsed.

Changing the parts of the machine which will be disabled eg. The coin mechanism the dispensing apparatus the bill acceptor etc. 

The following description consisting of Parts II III are to be read in conjunction with though which illustrate various methods of operation for a vending machine and associated apparatus such machine being described in Part I as well as business relationships which can benefit from and utilize a vending machine and associated apparatus having the features of the present invention.

Interested parties are generally entities which have a vested interest in the equipment. They can include but are not limited to 

product manufacturers which may own part or all of a machine or be giving subsides to the operator of the machine.

Data management companies which expect to receive sales and other data from the machine. These entities may be independent and buy the data from the vending machine operator or other party that owns the data or they may manage the data from the machines on for the benefit of another interested party such as a consumer products company.

Asset management companies which manage assets for the owners. For example a food company may pay a management company to manage and protect the food company s machines.

The machine does not receive an authorization code prior to receiving a specific total amount of aggregate payments from end users

The revenue sharing aspect of the invention relates to an interested party s desire to gain some benefit from the ongoing sales revenue generated out of a vending machine. In this aspect of the invention there are many structures which can be beneficial to all parties involved. This method can involve as few as two parties but can also involve many more parties.

For example a company that wishes to finance vending machines for a vending machine operating entity the operator who makes money actually operating the equipment can make the machine available to the operator in return for an agreed upon payment structure. This payment structure may or may not include a predetermined fee for the use of the machine. The payment structure can at least partially be based on the amount of revenue or related monies which are sold or dispensed from the machine. So in one case the operator might pay the finance company a monthly fee for the machine as well as be responsible for paying a fee which is calculated as being a percentage of the sales or profits generated from the machine as agreed upon in advance.

In another aspect the operator of the machine may have agreements with several parties relating to the same machine. For example a machine operator may have five product manufacturing companies companies A B C D and E one leasing company and one data and asset management company involved with the same machine.

All five of the product companies have an interest in their product being sold out of the machine. In this example two of the product companies companies A B are giving free product to the vending machine operator in exchange for sales location and demographic data on their products being sold by the operator as well as an agreement from the operator to stock and sell at least 4 of any type of products which are produced by companies A B in the machine. One of the product companies company C pays an up front contribution towards the cost of the machine in return for an agreement by the operator to always sell and stock at least 6 articles manufactured by the producer. Company C agrees to let the operator choose at the operator s own discretion any 2 of the articles produced by company C to put in the machine however they both agree in advance that the remaining 4 product selections will be specific ones. Company D agrees to pay part of the monthly lease payment for the machine in exchange for the operator agreeing to stock and sell 10 specific article selection types at all times produced by company D and also in exchange for the operator agreeing to share a defined percentage for example 3 of his revenues with company D to be paid by the operator on a monthly basis. Company E agrees to give the operator a one time payment and further agrees not to charge the operator for company E s products sold in the machine until one month after they are sold out of the machine offering the product to the operator on consignment in exchange for the operator agreeing to sell 8 specific types of company E s products out of the machine at all times and also pay 2 of revenue from company E s retail sales through the machine to company E.

There is also a leasing company which has leased the machine to the operator. Since the operator has a limited credit history the leasing company agrees to lease the machine to the operator under the condition that the machine will be programmed by a third party which can be the machine manufacturer or another authorized party to disable itself in the event that an authorization code is not received and input into the machine on a monthly basis. This authorization code will be made available to the operator and the machine every month on the condition that the operator maintains his financial obligations to the leasing company.

The product producers can each have similar agreements with the operator which would require them to authorize the release of authorization codes which need to be input into the machine in order to avoid the disabling a part or all of the machine. Separate authorization codes from the separate product companies or from their agents can be withheld in order to force a disabling of the product selections that relate to their individual agreements with the operator.

Since this can be a cumbersome situation for the product companies and even the leasing company to manage they can authorize agents or utilize one agent to manage their interests in the machine. Such a data and asset management company can monitor the machine and require the sales and other data be reported to them from the machine operator or the machine directly if it so enabled in order to confirm that the operator is following the agreed upon various contracts with the various interested parties which the management company is accountable to.

In this example the Leasing company and the five product producers decide to utilize the services of the same asset and data management company. The management company also requires that a nominal fee for example 0.25 of the sales from the machine must be paid to the management company for their services by the operator. The management company now is legally bound and entrusted to manage the machine for the parties involved based on agreements typically in writing . One other function that the management company can perform is to verify to the parties that there are no conflicts between the terms of any of the agreements involved preferably this is done before any new contract is signed.

One function that the management company performs is getting any and all agreed upon data from the operator and or the machine so that proper decisions of authorization code releases can be made. This requires the machine to have the ability to compile the relevant data in a format that is transferable and meaningful to the third party in this case the third party is the management company . In addition it is important that the data which is retrieved from the machine is accurate and true and not tampered with. Advantageously the machine should be equipped with the ability to encrypt or encode the data coming out of the machine so that an operator can not try to corrupt or adulterate it. Therefore even though accessing the data and communication from the machine may depend on the operator s cooperation the operator has no ability to change the authentic data from the machine. The external computer used to read the data and authenticate the operations of the machine will first be able to verify that the data has not been adulterated since the encryption technique will verify for example that the code sent has come from a specific machine at a specific time and in an authentic manner etc.

The above scenario puts the power in the hands of the product companies and banks. There is also the example where the operator rents out space in the machine in exchange for some of the machine s revenue as described more fully hereinafter.

One several or all of the interested parties could utilize a common agent such as a management company to protect their interests and to enforce their agreements which agreement may be independent or combined with the operator.

Agreements can have a term and the parties can agree what will happen to the restrictions on the machine or the machine itself at the end of a term.

A machine can be set up to facilitate both revenue sharing and rule enforcement. For example where the asset and data management company acts enables the product producers in the example above to collect their payments and apply them toward the leasing company until any excess is reached which is then forwarded to the operator.

1. Whereby a Vending machine producer wishes to offer a machine to a potential customer on a trial basis for a limited time or for a limited amount of trial usage and therefore sets the control system to have the ability to disable part or all of the vending machine and it s functions. This disabling can be determined and set to occur for example after a specific amount of time has lapsed or after a number of articles have been dispensed or after a specific amount of payments have been made to the machine.

2. Whereby a Bank money lender leasing company financial institution or investor or similar interested party has a concern regarding the fact that the equipment can be easily moved from one location to another. In order to improve their confidence that they can have some control over a portable asset such as a vending machine. The machine can be set to automatically disable unless an authorized code has been input into the control system. If the interested party such as a money lender has a concern about the whereabouts of the machine or the payments are overdue on a given machine the money lender can decide not to release an authorization code for one or more machines. Since this would render the machines inoperable to the one in physical possession of the machine the lender can be very confident that he will be able to either retrieve the payments due to him or at the least the money lender in this example should be able to repossess the machine since it has little value to anyone in the disabled state.

3. Furthermore the machine can have the ability to disable itself or be disabled in the event that the machine has been moved. This can be accomplished for example by putting sensors on the machine in order to detect the types of motion which would occur if the machine were to be moved. In the event for example that a machine has been lost or stolen and or sold to a third party in an illegal fashion and without the permission of the lender the new person taking possession of the machine would naturally call the manufacturer of the machine or their agent or distributor in order to re enable the machine. At that point the inquiry could be used to alert the lender as to the whereabouts of the machine. In addition the interested party can set the machine to display the phone number and other contact information or other messages on the graphic or digital display of the machine so that a person in possession of a stolen lost or seized machine can know whom to contact. This message and the disabling feature itself also acts as an barrier to someone trying to sell a disable machine. Other interested parties such as product and food producers may also want to be able to control the movement of machines they have an interest in and therefore they can also benefit from forcing the machine to be disabled in the event it is moved. Manufacturers who expect their products to be being dispensed at a specific location will want to know if a specific machine was removed from the location.

4. Any interested party may also have a desire to have access to certain information which can be communicated to them from the machine. Such information could include

The data that the control system uses in order to determine whether or not a given article is authorized to be dispensed is able to be updated and uploaded from an electronic data input device such as a computer a portable computer a memory storage device or other similar input device. In addition a keypad attached to the machine can also be used as the data input device. Can also be communicated by phone lines or a through a wireless transmission. The information and data being communicated to the controls system can be encrypted or secured using a known secure communications link.

In addition high security computer chips which have specific security features can be operable in the control system in order to facilitate a secure transmission of data to and from the machine control system. These secure communications to and from the control system can safeguard against any unauthorized party from attempting to learn how to cheat the authorization code system. In this way the control system cannot be studied by an unauthorized party attempting to ascertain what the next possible authorization code or code sequence is going to be.

In the event that someone were to try and replace the main control board with a fake board or a cheater control board the machine can have one or multiple security devices or computer chips mounted in various components apparatus and accessories throughout the equipment and machine. These security devices can communicate with each other so as to be designed to disable specific components or apparatus within the machine in the event that any tampering of the control system has been detected by any one of the security devices in the machine. So for example if someone were to try and replace the main micro controller board of the machine with an unauthorized controller board security devices and features in components such as the motors digital displays touch screens wire harnesses keypads encoders switches control boards motor controllers or any other electronic device could be designed to disable one or several capabilities or functions of at least one aspect of an apparatus or part of the machine thereby rendering the apparatus partially or fully disabled and inoperable. A security scheme such as described above can have many variations and embodiments however the key idea of this aspect of the invention is to cause it to be highly impractical for someone to benefit financially by trying to cheat the system.

Additional security measures can be taken in order to protect the electronics and control system of the machine from being cheated such as embedding part or all of the control system in a potting compound or an epoxy thereby making it inaccessible. In addition one could secure the control system by using more conventional methods such as welding or locking key parts of the control system in an enclosure. Such an enclosure could be removable for servicing whereby the entire enclosure can be replaced by another authorized unit while preventing all the while any unauthorized person from gaining access to the key component. Additionally certain operational code for the machine can be kept in high security chips so that it becomes more expensive for a person to try and reverse engineer the control system forcing them to engineer a totally new control system.

Security measures such as those described above can give confidence to an interested party such as a bank a product manufacturer or a vending machine manufacturer that they will be able to maintain some control over their investment and control over the machine. In the event that parts from a stolen machine are installed in another machine they can be designed to not work without an authorization code.

While the preferred embodiment of the rule enforcement and disabling techniques described herein is described as utilizing a robotic vending machine other machine designs can greatly benefit from the same business methods and the same disabling techniques and concepts. For example some of these techniques can be modified to function successfully in spiral snack machines as well as beverage machines.

A machine progranmed to disable itself after a certain predetermined amount of vending has occurred within a predefined amount of time so that if the operator wishes to continue to use the machine for additional usage within that define time range they will have to pay for additional usage in order to re enable the machine and continue to operate. If the operator negotiates this in advance he can avoid the shut down of the machine.

Where the disabling of the machine can include the disabling of any key apparatus or accessory associated with the machine such as the bill validator the coin mech etc.

A bar code or other image vision recognition system for verifying stored article and or proper operation and dispensing of article.

Use of a robotic mechanism for bringing stored articles to the article ID system. the robot can pass the article in proximity to the ID device or scanner and move the product in a pattern to enable a code search process to help locate the code on the article.

Additionally the controls system can use the information learned from a prior package code search to improve the efficiency of subsequent searches and search patterns of articles from the same bin or presumed to be of the same type as one already scanned. For example once the code of a certain article type has been found to be scanned with the robot a certain distance away from the scanner then the next time a similar article is being scanned the robot can begin it s search with the robot in the same relative position relative to the scanner as the point of success of the prior scan.

Even furthermore the robotic mechanism can be selectively controlled so as to improve the reliability of article identification i.e. movement of article past the ID system can be slowed and for flexible bag articles the article may be jiggled so as to change the flex of the bag and thereby improve scanning of a bar code or better optical recognition of an image

Scanning for article ID can be at any time for verification and operation purposes i.e. not just during or as part of a vend cycle but also between cycles.

Proper operation and dispensing of article may include adherence to predetermined rules and interaction with the control system for reporting and enforcement purposes as well as further control of the vending machine for furthering the enforcement purposes. Articles identified as unauthorized can be put back in bin or dispensed and then further article dispensing from that storage area can be disabled unauthorized articles can also be automatically placed by robot in a special holding area for later inspection 

Use of an optical ID system for spiral Gravity feed machines to identify article package type etc. prior to being dispensed e.g. while article is falling or rolling in the case of beverage container etc. or already landed at the customer retrieval area.

Determination of article ID is made during a dispensing operation after dispense is initiated and the cycle is irreversible.

Article ID for inventory management Pay As You Vend PAYV equipment financing or for calculating incentives based on proper operation and or adherence to rules

Addition of circuitry enabling remote connectivity of the vending machine for inventory management as well as for operational control.

Once there is article IID such as a bar code scanner and or a camera along with other data available about the dispensing operation of the machine it is possible to set up rules for the Authorized operation of the machine and if those rules are not followed part or all of the vending machine can be shut down.

The enforcement possibility facilitates among other things Pay As You Vend PAYV business methods where the purchase price or a lease or bonus payment of a vending machine or for that matter any other type of article handling dispensing apparatus can be set up so that as an example periodic payments are made based on the quantity or value of the articles handled during a given time period. If the data needed to calculate the payments due by the party leasing the equipment or the payments themselves are not provided the machine may be pre programmed to automatically default to a shut down mode at some point in time. If the payments and or data are provided authorization codes are given to the operator preferably before the equipment has been shut down which prevent the default shut down. An authorization code can also be given to re activate a machine that has been fully or partially disabled in a vending machine environment. This can be implemented by a machine manufacturer or a distributor or a finance company or a product manufacturer providing a vending machine to an operator and require that the operator make periodic financing payments based on the quantity or value of the articles vended during a given time period prior to the payment date.

Furthermore the machine can be pre programmed to shut down if an authorization code is not entered at periodic intervals. The authorization code could be given to the operator or communicated to the machine if the proper payment and sales data are made. This results in a win win situation for both parties since the more successful the operation of the machine the more money is available for the operator to make larger payments and the more money the manufacturer or lessor is able to make in a given time period.

New business methods relating to advantages provided to the machine operator by the above described novel apparatus. For example 

Once a reliable and verifiable database of sales data is available it can be used to obtain volume discounts both for the operator from the article manufacturers and for loyal customers from grateful operators or as a promotion etc from an article manufacturer .

Once a reliable and verifiable database of sales data is available it can be used as a feedback tool to the machine operator where adherence to predetermined rules may result in the operator getting an incentive or bonus.

Once a reliable and verifiable database of sales data is available it can be used as a basis for a lease payment for the space where the machine is positioned such as at a shopping mall.

The database can be made accessible to interested parties via the Internet or other remote accessing technique which will further facilitate this business method.

The bar code reader mounted to an interior wall of cabinet and positioned so that the article moves over the scanned surface thereof during the dispensing operation. In this manner control system can maintain accurate information relating to the articles dispensed by the vending machine thereby enabling new methods for operating a vending machine a business for operating a vending machine as well as a business for financing or leasing a vending machine as described in other parts of this application. Since article ID is accomplished during dispensing while the machine is not normally attended by the owner operator as compared to during loading more reliable operational information is developed by the sales management information system. Although a bar code scanner is illustrated alternative imaging systems could be used. For example a digital still camera an analog or digital video camera or similar imaging device or a radio frequency RF ID device may be used for obtaining article ID information.

The above described apparatus can facilitate new business methods relating to article or article identification during or as part of a dispensing apparatus.

1. Revenue sharing where payments by the operator or renter lessee to the owner lessor of the equipment are based on usage of the machine or usage can be based on operation cycles an accounting of time that the operator has had use of the equipment the amount of money that the apparatus has generated etc.

Typically revenue sharing between an owner and an operator of the apparatus is based on DATA descriptive of the usage operation of the machine. Prior art attempts at revenue sharing have been less than satisfactory because usage data can be falsely reported or not reported at all. Furthermore most revenue sharing arrangements between an owner and an operator require the operator to make payments to the owner which payments can be difficult to collect especially since the owner may not even know exactly where the equipment is located.

For these and other reasons the present invention provides an equipment such as a vending machine which has a built in enforcement system. This enforcement system partially or fully disables the apparatus in the event that the machine is not operated in accordance with preset rules which the operator and the owner of the machine agreed upon in advance. Revenue sharing arrangements can include linking the operator s cost of using an apparatus to the revenue which the apparatus will generate. Therefore it is possible to make equipment available to an operator in a way that reduces the operator s risk. This risk to the operator is reduced since the typically fixed costs associated with renting or buying the equipment are now variable. This enables the operator to have much more flexibility and encourages business expansion into business opportunities that would have previously been riskier or not viable at all. This has benefits for both the equipment operator e.g. reduced risk and greater financial flexibility and the equipment owner e.g. increased sales of equipment and can offer same equipment at variable costs to customers based on usage without jeopardizing the high profits which are generated by conventional sales on equipment which may have no restrictions .

Obviously the revenue sharing business method can include sharing revenues or revenue based payments with parties other than the operator and or the owner such as payments to a product producer who is subsidizing the equipment or a real estate owner who provides space for the equipment e.g. such as at a shopping mall or a factory .

2. Adherence to rules agreed upon by an equipment operator and owner or other party with a vested interest of the machine. In the case that as an example a product producer who may sell the products or services to be vended from the apparatus or another interested party wishes to subsidize partially or fully the cost of a piece of equipment there are often rules that the parties agree to in advance. These rules may typically require the operator to sell only certain types or kinds of merchandise through the equipment. Various arrangements are generally known where usage of a part or all of a piece of equipment will be restricted to a certain type of product or a specific brand. However again these relationships have been based on trust and whatever reporting methods can be employed. In some cases electronic reporting from the equipment directly or indirectly through a communication device can be used to inform the necessary parties as to the true nature of the usage of the machine. Several problems still exist however.

One problem is that the owner has little or no direct way of enforcing his agreement with the operator. Currently the Owner or interested party perhaps in this case a product producer may have a difficult time verifying the reports from the equipment operator. Furthermore the operator may not always be willing to be cooperative with the owner or other party and may not give them access to the necessary data from the apparatus. Even still further even if an operator is willing to share data with another party the operator may also find it hard to authenticate the specific products vended from an apparatus. For example in a traditional spiral type vending machine the selection D2 may be thought of as storing one specific type or brand of product when in reality the spiral instead is storing and dispensing a totally different brand or type of product. Regardless of whether the equipment is intentionally or unintentionally loaded incorrectly the route person in the field might be the only one who realizes the discrepancy if anyone realizes it at all . Therefore it is desirable to have the ability to Verify the identity of the actual product being stored in the apparatus.

Other attempts have been made to utilize bar code scanners in vending machines in order to try and detect unauthorized product in the machine. The Sanyo patent JP 4123194 and the Murphy Patent U.S. Pat. No. 5 390 711 both show some ways of trying to achieve this. The Sanyo patent shows bar code scanners at the loading point of a conventional beverage machine whereby any unauthorized product would be detected at the time the product is loaded. This design may show some benefit in the case of the machine operator or route service loading person who simply tries to mistakenly put the wrong product in the machine. However this design does little to actually prevent an intentional attempt by an operator or other person trying to put unauthorized product into the machine. This is due to the fact that if the detection of unauthorized products is occurring when the machine is being loaded then that person could easily defeat the scanner in several ways. For one the route person could cover up the bar code scanner with paper or another object while loading the machine. In another case someone could simply have a piece of paper with an authorized bar code printed on it and by waving that over the bar code scanner the machine will be tricked into vending unauthorized product. Referring to the patent by Murphy the same problem is dealt with in a somewhat similar manner. By placing a bar code scanner at each spiral product storage area and with a relatively complex scanning mechanism Murphy attempts to disable the machine from dispensing unauthorized product. Both Sanyo and Murphy require one Scanner or product identification system for each storage area spiral or column of cans . This makes the practical usefulness of the designs very limited since scanners are relatively expensive delicate and require accurate proximity to the code to be scanned in order to be effective. Murphy is an improvement over Sanyo in one sense in that it minimizes the chance of cheating by a route person since the verification of each code occurs before dispensing not at the time of loading. Murphy further shows that cheating attempts by covering over the scanner will shut down the operation of the machine.

A further disadvantage of both Sanyo and Murphy is the fact that bar code scanners and other ID devices are very sensitive to reading the code within a highly defined proximity. The prior art described shows the scanners in a fixed position with the products to be scanned also in a highly defined position. This is also very impractical if the machine is going to be able to store and vend objects and articles of various sizes and shapes. Spiral machines are designed to hold various types of articles and packages in one spiral at the same time. Therefore in order for a design such as Murphy s to work effectively it would require a reliable identification of product every time.

In the present invention there is described a multi axis dispensing and product positioning mechanism. As product is removed from the storage areas the product or articles can be brought within proximity to over the Product ID scanner . This design is far more efficient and an improvement over the prior art in several ways. For example in the present invention there is only the need for as few as one product ID devices since the dispensing mechanism carries the product to the ID device. Due to the cost and delicate nature of installing these types of devices in a machine of this cost a dramatic cost savings and increased reliability are now achieved with the present invention.

Additionally the product positioning system can manipulate the product to be scanned or identified until the control system gives back a signal confirming that a code has been read or permission to vend the product without a successful product ID.

The preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with a storage system of containers which hold product which is of uniform type. Additionally in the preferred embodiment the product is merchandised using graphics on the outside of the machine in such a way that the end customer is usually not able to see the actual package or article to be dispensed. This type of merchandising also forces the operator to keep only one article type in any given bin and preprogrammed to at least one specific selection key. If the entire or a large portion of the front of the machine comprises a single graphic it further enhances this enforcement aspect of the invention.

While the present invention has a more reliable code reading method the dedicated nature of the product storage bins due to the graphics blocking a view of the products by the user allows for a system which doesn t need to read 100 of the packages from any given container in order to determine that authorized product is generally being stored there. This enables the control system of the present embodiment to analyze the statistical data of the codes read or not read from a given container. With this analysis the control system can determine whether it can allow a certain amount of acceptable error in the loading or the mis loading of the product in the machine.

Using an algorithm the control system can also detect whether product is perhaps being loaded into the machine in a position which makes the code unreadable. Regardless of the determination of the control system based on the desired strictness of the algorithm the control system can then communicate the problem to an external computer the digital display on the machine or simply to maintain the information in memory for use at a later time.

The scanner can also be used for traditional uses like inventory control and accountability as well as time stamping for preventing sale of food product which is stale. In the present invention if the control system determines that the article is not authorized the control system can disable access to that product storage bins area or disable the entire machine.

One problem facing vending machine operators is the control of the product selections placed in machines by their route personnel. Managers of vending companies often want machines merchandised in a specific way with a specific product selection plan i.e. according to a plan o gram . They find it difficult to enforce a discipline in their route personnel who actually load the machines. The person actually loading or restocking the machine often tends to have his own preferences regarding the selections of products to be stocked in the machine.

These preferred embodiments solve this problem by guaranteeing that the verified product specific sales data is captured and can be analyzed by the appropriate person.

Furthermore the control system in the preferred embodiment has the ability to monitor and measure the effectiveness accuracy and discipline of a given route person in adhering to the prescribed merchandising plan. For example the controls system can monitor

1 the time it takes between the service door opening and closing again to indicate the total loading time that a driver spent at a machine 

2 the number of unauthorized products if any that the driver route person may have put in the machine or

3 if the route person is filling all selections in the machine up to a sufficient capacity this is achieved by measuring the known number of vends which occurred on a given product between the last fill servicing and the point at which a given selection is sold out and comparing that number to the known capacity that a given selection is capable of storing in a specific container .

There are several purposes that this employee performance data can be used for. For example the performance data can be analyzed by software residing on the machine control system or at an external site and this analysis can be used to calculate at least one performance measurement which can then be displayed or communicated to the route person at the machine or to a reporting system which can give a more detailed analysis. The analysis can for example include showing the affect that the performance has had on revenue at a particular machine and can also show the employee the positive or negative impact that his performance at a given machine or a conglomerated group of machines has had on his her potential commission or bonus incentives. In this way monitoring machine performance especially as it relates to the service record of a given employee creates a powerful tool which can be used in order to educate discipline and motivate the employee in an automated fashion. Every time that a service person stops at a machine to service it he will automatically be seeing his performance rating on that machine or a group of machines based on an analysis of the machine s problem and fill levels since the last time that the route person was at that machine. In doing the analysis in this way it gives feedback to the employee in a manner which links his incentives on a given machine to that machine. It is well known that incentives or punishment are most effective when they are linked to a specific action or inaction and that the measurement of the performance be given as soon as possible after the occurrence of the event that is being assessed.

The apparatus will have product identification product ID device means which could include but is not limited to at least one of a bar code scanner a magnetic reading device an optical image recognition device a radio frequency ID device a video camera a digital camera. The product ID device or multiple devices is used in conjunction with the dispensing and storage apparatus and is capable of identifying the products which are being dispensed from the apparatus. Checking the product ID after it has been removed from the storage area or at least just before the product moves from it s storage area is preferable to checking the product during loading or at other times. This is true especially when the ID device is being utilized as described here for the

If anyone tampers with a communication device such as a wireless device connected to the machine the machine can be programmed to disable itself and re enable only with a proper authorization code.

As described at the beginning of this application the inventive techniques described herein can also be utilized for other applications such as leased business equipment and other types of equipment and machinery.

Further embodiments and aspects of the invention are described next and the below text is intended to be read in conjunction with the foregoing text and Figures.

Thus in one embodiment a multiple robot configuration for example may be contained within a warehousing structure. The system can utilize a common computer system to control all processes including conveyance dispensing and monitoring whereby at least one conveyor system for moving a containment structure such as a bag basket box or other type of container from one location to another the system further having at least two robots are positioned so as to be operative to remove articles from storage bins e.g. Typically articles of different types with different storage requirements within the reach of the respective robots. The conveyor system which may be of many varied methods generally known can convey the container in order to allow the robots to place articles within their reach into the common bag or box prior to dispensing or conveying the container or box to a customer retrieval location. This customer retrieval location or locations can be remote to the housing structure that contains the article storage facilities and or the article conveyor systems.

Additionally the other described aspects of the invention such as article ID systems control techniques and mechanical apparatus described herein may be applied to this embodiment. Other aspects that can be utilized advantageously here may be connection to a computer network such as the internet LAN WAN Wireless etc. wherein a customer or user may monitor or order from the system. In one scenario the user can order articles to be dispensed over the computer network and have them ready and waiting in a customer holding area so that the customer can retrieve the container or articles at a later time. A user can also use a touch screen in proximity to the automated dispensing system or retrieval area and or the remote computer system or network to check the inventory or availability of a specific item or items.

In a further embodiment this system can also be utilized as a mini warehouse system. In this scenario the storage areas may contain articles or packages which are placed there specifically for access and retrieval by a certain person or entity. Using a passcode or access card or similar device or using a payment method the user can retrieve packages such as parcels letters or other shipped goods from the storage area. This provides for a very convenient system since traditional deliveries to a person or entities home or place of business often requiring a physical signature and for a both parties to be present to receive and have the article delivered. Instead the delivering party and the receiving party can use the article storage and dispensing apparatus as an exchange device allowing for the two parties to carry out the transfer of goods without having the requirement of being at the same place at the same time. Additionally the use of a pass code or a swipe card which may be connected to a gasoline pump or any one of a multitude of devices including biometric devices such as facial or fingerprint recognition could be used as a verifiable electronic signature to ensure accountability. The elements described herein can be used in various other useful combinations which are considered part of the invention.

This dispensing apparatus can be used in locations such as Gas Station islands parking lots or convenience stores etc. whereby products are delivered to customers from the dispensing apparatus for example using a pneumatic tube or a conveyor system bringing articles from a remote storage area of the vending apparatus to a location on the perimeter of the apparatus housing or to location external and or remote to the housing of the apparatus whereby the customer interface such as a touch screen device and remote retrieval area can be accessed by the customer for remote delivery of articles conveyed and dispensed from the vending apparatus. The described invention can be used in an automated supermarket and such things as automated storerooms or stockrooms in office buildings and commercial locations.

Furthermore where the central computer system has software code that enables it to manage determine and execute the financial matters between the entities. Such matters may include debiting or crediting accounts of various of the involved entities or creating a bill or invoice for one entity to present to another entity. This financial information is determined from analysis of the information which may be communicated to the central computer system from at least one other source. Other sources may include the control system of the vending apparatus or for example the computer network or system of an involved or interested entity.

In one scenario an operator desires a vending apparatus so he can place it at a specific location. In some instances an operator doesn t know how much activity the machine will get and he therefore may have to decide whether he can justify placing the machine at the location. One of the significant factors needed to make the decision for whether or not to place the vending machine in a location or for that matter whether or not to buy or lease or rent the machine at all is obviously the cost of the machine. While various traditional financing methods may be useful to stretch out the cost of the machine over time none of the prior art financing methods are designed to determine the payment or payments to be paid for the machine by the operator or other interested entity based on the performance parameters of the machine in a specific circumstance. For example a parameter may be the amount of money inserted into the machine over a specific time period. Alternatively or additionally another parameter may be how many units were sold over a specific time or further without any measured relationship to a time element.

So for example the seller or owner of the machine may wish to lease or rent or sell the equipment to an operator or user and is willing to have the cost of the equipment to the operator or user be determined at least partially or fully if agreed based on a parameter related to the machine such as the amount of sales generated from the machine. Following this scenario a machine manufacturer or a leasing company may be willing to lease or rent the equipment to the operator operator could be a buyer in this case or a renter etc. for a payment or price that is less than the traditional market price equivalent. The monthly payment may for example have a very nominal or none at all profit margin for the machine manufacturer or leasing company to benefit from initially. The regular payment if there is agreed to be one at all is fixed in this example and the user or operator must pay additional payments which are determined based on his usage of the equipment. Furthermore the equipment may have a minimal or limited ability to operate either in terms of features which are limited or in terms of usage which may be limited or restricted. So for example a given piece of equipment may be pre programmed to disable if more than 3 000 of vending or revenue has occurred within a time frame of one year. The control system may be further programmed to reset a specific counter which counts the money received by the machine whenever the time interval of one year has passed. Therefore if the operator finds himself having vended 2 954 dollars within a twelve month interval he doesn t have to worry about the machine disabling since on the first day of the new cycle the meter will turn back to 0 dollars vended and will again allow another 3 000 to be vended over the subsequent twelve months. However if the operator has vended 3 000 worth of goods and there are still for example 3 months left in the year the machine will be disabled. In order to avoid the disabling of the machine the operator would for example contact the management entity who controls the enabling codes for the machine and the operator would pay or agree to be billed for an increased ability to utilize the equipment. The operator may choose to pay for the ability to vend for example 1 500 of additional goods during the remaining 3 months of the year. Of course the system can be set to allow any remaining additionally ability to use purchased usage credits to continue into the following time interval or period of the following year so in this way an operator doesn t need to be accurate in predicting his additional usage requirements on a given machine.

The managing entity typically a manager which represents the owner or leasing company or manufacturer will determine possibly automatically through use of the central computer system whether or not to release an authorization code such as a continuation code or an enable re enable etc. code as the case may be a re enable code is needed after the equipment has already been shut down to the operator or entity requesting the code. Once the code is received and accepted by the computer control system of the vending apparatus the vending machine will continue on as per the specific instructions of the latest received authorization code. The authorization code might for example also change the ongoing limitations of the machine if so determined. For example if the operator and owner of the machine have agreed to increase the annual limit of the machine from 3 000 per year to 4 500 per year then a code can be released to the operator for communication to the machine or transmitted to the machine directly if the connection is available which causes the computer control system of the apparatus to modify the restriction of disabling accordingly.

Additionally an operator could agree with a managing entity to have the ability to apply usage credits to a group of separate equipment. So in this way the operator can apply credits to any one of several pieces of his equipment.

If an additional entity has contracted with the operator to sell a specific type of product or brand of goods the machine and ID system can communicate to the central computer system in order to monitor compliance to the parameter. If the periodic continuation code is not input to the machine the machine may be pre programmed to disable part or all of the apparatus or to modify or limit in some way the features or capabilities of the machine. The authorization code required may be released by an authorized entity when the entity is satisfied that the agreement between the parties is being met.

In some cases the contracts between numerous entities may be controlled together or separately relating to the same piece of equipment. So for example if the owner of a vending machine is the operator of the machine he may be interested in renting out space in the machine much like a mall owner might rent out space in a building. Numerous entities may have an interest in the same piece of equipment. The financial investor or leasing company might simply wish to know that the machine is creating a threshold of revenue. Various sellers of goods or suppliers of products may wish to guarantee the space for storing and selling their products out of the machine. Using a central computer which may be operated by a separate management entity the owner operator of the machine may have contracts with the various interested parties whereby the management entity collects verifies authenticates and redistributes the data relating to the vending machine. Furthermore the management company may be authorized to debit credit or bill various parties automatically as the data from the machine is received and analyzed. A given agreement can even design so that depending on the performance of the sales of a given product the operator or the supplier of goods could be required to pay the other a payment. If the product sells well for example the operator may be entitled to a bonus payment or rebate payment from the goods producer. However if the sales of the goods are poor the operator may be require to refund a portion or all of the rental payment which the goods producer paid for renting the machine space. This information and transaction of funds can all be processed by one or more central computer systems which are communicating directly or indirectly with all of the relevant entities. In another agreement relating to the same machine the operator may be required to make payments to buy the machine from the machine producer. The machine producer may contract with the operator and the management company for receiving at least part of the payment or compensation for the machine as coming from the payments being made by yet another entity such as the goods producer. So for example if the goods producer is debited for a rebate owed to the operator the operator could assign part or all of the payment to be transferred directly or indirectly to the account of another entity such as the machine manufacturer. In this way accounts can be settled or bartered or exchanged between multiple parties without necessarily having the monies transfer to initial recipient. The central computer then acts as an exchange system which can facilitate numerous business dealings both monetary as well as non monetary exchanges communications and services.
