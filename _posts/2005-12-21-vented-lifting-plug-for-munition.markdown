title: Vented lifting plug for munition
abstract: Apparatus for venting munitions exposed to high ambient temperatures. The munition includes a casing having a nose end and an opening in the nose end; a lifting plug disposed in the opening in the nose end, the lifting plug including a bore therethrough; and a seal disposed in the bore in the lifting plug, the seal comprising an ionomer. The munition may further include a fuze well disposed in the casing, the opening in the nose end leading into the fuze well; and a second seal disposed in the fuze well. The seals will rupture and vent the munition's explosive to the atmosphere.

This application claims benefit under 35 USC 119 e of provisional application 60 597 301 filed Nov. 22 2005 the entire file wrapper contents of which provisional application are herein incorporated by reference as though fully set forth at length.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

Because of their weight most separate loading projectiles munitions include an eyebolt lifting plug. The plug is for lifting to keep the fuze well clean dry and free of foreign matter and to protect the fuze well threads. At the firing location the plug is removed and the appropriate fuze is inserted.

munitions. For example the accidental detonation of one munition should not cause a chain reaction of detonations of adjacent munitions. Also in case of a fire the increase in ambient temperature should not cause an explosive detonation. One way to help meet the IM requirements is to provide a vent in the munition. As the explosive in a munition begins to react due to an increase in ambient temperature the temperature and pressure inside the munition increases. By relieving the pressure in the munition the speed and violence of the reaction may be controlled.

It is another object of the invention to provide a munition with a vent for relieving excess pressure.

A further object of the invention is to provide a munition with a vent that is normally closed but that opens with increased pressure and or temperature in the munition.

Still another object of the invention is to provide a venting apparatus that may be used with existing munitions.

One aspect of the invention is a munition comprising a casing having a nose end and an opening in the nose end a lifting plug disposed in the opening in the nose end the lifting plug including a bore therethrough and a seal disposed in the bore in the lifting plug the seal comprising an ionomer.

The munition may further comprise a fuze well disposed in the casing the opening in the nose end leading into the fuze well and a second seal disposed in the fuze well. Preferably the second seal also comprises an ionomer. In one embodiment at least one of the seal and the second seal are solid. In another embodiment at least one of the seal and the second seal has a hollow interior.

The munition may comprise an explosive disposed in the casing wherein as the explosive is heated the seal and the second seal will fail before the explosive detonates.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

In one embodiment the munition is provided with both a fuze well seal and a lifting plug seal . Due to a fire or other event the munition is exposed to an exothermal source. As the casing heats up the explosive payload absorbs thermal energy. The explosive starts to expand and exert pressure on the fuze well seal . The increase in temperature causes the fuze well seal to soften. As the pressure continues to increase the fuze well seal ruptures. The explosive then forces its way into the fuze well .

As more thermal energy is imparted to the casing the lifting plug seal softens and the explosive continues to expand. The increasing pressure causes the lifting plug seal to rupture. The explosive is then exposed to the atmosphere and vents the built up pressure in the casing . When exposed to the hot atmosphere the explosive will ignite in a controlled manner due to the limited size of the fuze well opening. The explosive will start to burn and spew from the casing until all the explosive has either been expelled or burned. In this way the munition releases its explosive energy in a way that is less destructive than a detonation. Both seals and will fail before the pressure and temperature in the casing are great enough to detonate the explosive . It is believed that the seal fails at about 115 degrees Centigrade and the seal fails at about 125 degrees Centigrade with a corresponding pressure of about 60 psi.

Upon exposure to ambient heat the casing and fuze well heat the expelling charge and the seal . The seal softens and the resultant increase in pressure from the expelling charge will rupture the seal . The expelling charge will burn off similar to explosive described above. Without the expelling charge the grenades remain unarmed in the casing . Under continued heating it is possible that one or more grenades may explode. However the grenades remain in the casing which helps to contain the explosion.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
