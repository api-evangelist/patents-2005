title: Hyper-spectral/continuously-tunable imager
abstract: The invention employs a linear variable interference filter, which can be manually moved back and forth along its long axis in front of a slit parallel to its short axis. Thus, the filter pass-band varies linearly from 4,000 angstroms to 10,000 angstroms with a pass-band half-width no greater than 65 angstroms. Therefore, this combination of filter and slit can be placed in front of a charge coupled device (CCD) or other electro-optical imaging device and real time images can be taken as the filter is slid back and forth. Magnifying optics, beam-splitters and scale illuminators can be used to make the scale visible within the field of view of the camera imager. Or, as a simpler embodiment, the graduated image scale could in the form of a hologram of a graduated image scale taken at distance consistent with the desired depth of focus of the camera/imager.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used sold imported and or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America.

The invention relates to instrumentation for viewing and recording hyper spectral or continuously tunable narrow band visible and infrared imagery in standard National Television System Committee NTSC or other video formats.

Current prior art for tunable narrow band imagery requires using grated spectrograph techniques. Most known devices utilize a double slit spectrograph that provides for the synchronous scanning of both slits across two image planes one slit scans the input image plane and the other slit scans the viewing or camera image plane. In more advanced known art the scanning motion is produced by moving a platform such as an aircraft flying a straight and level course over terrain to be imaged. In this case the second slit is replaced by a Charge Coupled Device CCD linear array or rectangular array so that line scans of multiple wavebands can be obtained simultaneously . In these systems the synchronous scanning of the second slit is accomplished electronically and generally involves computer processing and digital hard drive memory storage.

The disadvantages of the current art are 1 the inability to image or view an image scene in real time or at least within the time of one NTSC videoframe 2 the relative size weight and bulk of the current systems due to the required optical paths the large amount of digital processing equipment to store and read out the images and 3 the high power consumption 100s of watts . These disadvantages make the current systems prohibitive for a wide range of in field scientific military criminal forensic and homeland security applications.

Accordingly there is in a need in the prior art to make a hyper spectral or continuously tunable narrow band visible and infrared imager that is low power portable and can view and record images in real time. The present invention addresses these needs.

Accordingly one object of the present invention is to provide a hyper spectral or continuously tunable narrow band visible and infrared imager that is low power portable and can view and record images in real time.

The invention accomplishes this objective and others by employing a linear variable interference filter instead of the conventional grating spectrograph. By moving the filter back forth along its long axis in front of a slit parallel to its short axis the filter pass band varies linearly from 4 000 angstroms to 10 000 angstroms with a pass band half width no greater than 65 angstroms. Therefore this combination of filter and slit can be placed in front of a charge coupled device CCD or other electro optical imaging device and real time images can be taken as the filter is slid back and forth. Magnifying optics beam splitters and scale illuminators can be used to make the scale visible within the field of view of the camera imager. Or as a simpler embodiment the graduated image scale could in the form of a hologram of a graduated image scale taken at distance consistent with the desired depth of focus of the camera imager.

The invention is a hyper spectral or continuously tunable imager. It provides a means for viewing and recording hyper spectral narrow band visible and infrared imagery in a standard NTSC or other video format. The invention also provides a way of identifying the center wavelength of each recorded video frame in a way such that it will remain with the image regardless of what subsequent digitizing or processing is performed on the video frame.

The invention is a hand held sensor that can interfere directly with standard analog or digital video recorders and has a 90 field of view. It is intended for daylight operation. The power source required is for the charge coupled device CCD infrared IR sensitive camera.

The invention employs a linear variable interference filter instead of the conventional grating spectrograph to provide the continuously tunable or hyper spectral imaging. Such filters are commercially available and nominally are 5 mm thick glass pieces measuring 25 mm high by 200 mm long. By moving the filter back forth along its long axis in front of a slit parallel to its short axis the filter pass band varies linearly from 4 000 angstroms to 10 000 angstroms with a pass band half width no greater than 65 angstroms. The sensor s pass band half width is nominally 25 angstroms at 4000 angstroms and 65 angstroms at 0.9 microns. Therefore this combination of filter and slit can be placed in front of a charge coupled device CCD or other electro optical imaging device and real time images can be taken as the filter is slid back and forth. Nominally a camera to be used for the invention would be one with an object lens aperture of 3 mm or less with respect to the long variable wavelength axis of the variable filter.

What one would see with the filter at rest in any position would be a narrow band image at the wavelength corresponding to that particular filer position. In order to superimpose the instantaneous center wavelength of the filter on the image a graduated wavelength scale is affixed directly on or near the edge of the filer when it is initially calibrated.

Magnifying optics beam splitters and scale illuminators can be used to make the scale visible within the field of view of the camera imager. Or as a simpler embodiment the graduated image scale could in the form of a hologram of a graduated image scale taken at distance consistent with the desired depth of focus of the camera imager.

Of course those skilled in the art could devise any number of different embodiments of the invention including moving the filter automatically via some means or adjusting the wavelengths and pass bands to fit any need.
