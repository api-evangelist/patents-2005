No. 6 485 057 issued Nov. 26 2002 which is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 09 207 908 filed on Dec. 9 1998 abandoned for AUTOMOTIVE PASSENGER RESTRAINT AND PROTECTION APPARATUS AND SEATBELT PROTRACTION AND RETRACTION AMOUNT DETECTING DEVICE the entire disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention relates to an automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus for automotive vehicles such as automobiles which uses an electric retractor for retracting and protracting a seatbelt for protection of an occupant driver or passenger and also relates to a seatbelt retraction and protraction amount detecting device.

Conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatuses are operable upon a large deceleration of the automotive vehicle such as a collision to restrain an occupant by means of a seatbelt to prevent him from being thrown out of his seat and hence protect him from danger.

Conventional automotive restraint and protection apparatus include a type provided with a seatbelt retractor for retracting or winding a seatbelt. The seatbelt retractor is generally provided with bias force imparting means such as a spiral spring which always biases a reel shaft takeup shaft on which the seatbelt is wound in a retracting or winding direction. The seatbelt is wound up on the reel shaft due to the bias force provided by the bias force imparting means when the seatbelt is not mounted on the occupant and is protracted or withdrawn against the bias force to fasten or restrain the occupant when the seatbelt is mounted on the occupant.

The seatbelt retractor is provided with emergency locking means which is normally actuated upon a large deceleration of the vehicle as mentioned above to impede rotation of the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction so as for the seatbelt to surely restrain and protect the occupant.

According to the conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus however to mount the seatbelt onto the occupant the occupant has to protract the seatbelt against the bias force of the bias force imparting means which requires the occupant to exert some force to protract the seatbelt. As a result a weak occupant who has degraded physical ability such as that which occurs with advanced age takes a long time to mount the seatbelt onto his body.

Further there can be a case that the occupant feels uneasy while he wears the seatbelt since he feels a sense of oppression owing to the bias force of the bias force imparting means.

Moreover the conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus is not provided with means for warning the occupant of danger to be caused by a doze and a collision.

A further disadvantage with the conventional apparatus is that an alien substance can become attached to the seatbelt after a long term use which causes an increased friction between the seatbelt and a through anchor associated therewith leading to insufficient retraction of the seatbelt.

The conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus has another disadvantage that when the occupant has protracted the seatbelt without the intention of wearing the same it can happen that the seatbelt cannot be retracted until a certain time period elapses. Thus the seatbelt cannot be quickly retracted against the occupant s desire.

Further in the conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus in retracting the seatbelt into its extreme retracted position if the occupant intentionally stops the seatbelt at a position apart from his body and then judges that the seatbelt has reached its extreme retracted position the seatbelt can be set in position in an abnormally loosened state.

Further in the conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus when the occupant looks back for parking the vehicle while moving his body to protract the seatbelt the seatbelt is wound back or retracted into the extreme retracted position after the completion of protraction of the seatbelt which gives a feeling of unnaturalness to the occupant.

Furthermore when the occupant s body is not in a proper position for driving the vehicle that is his body is not facing forwardly of the vehicle the seatbelt can be wound up into the extreme retracted position based upon which position the occupant is given a predetermined amount of looseness of the seatbelt which can result in an inappropriate amount of looseness of the seatbelt being given to the occupant to make him feel uncomfortable.

In the conventional passenger restraint and protection apparatus in the event that the seatbelt becomes locked when a motor for driving the seatbelt is rotated in the direction of the seatbelt being protracted no force is acted upon the seatbelt to retract the same so that the seatbelt is kept in the locked state which can make it impossible to protract the seatbelt unless a condition is newly set for the seatbelt to be retracted.

The condition for the seatbelt to be retracted is set in the cases where the vehicle is suddenly braked the seatbelt is taken off or disconnected from the occupant s body and it is judged that the occupant s vehicle is about to collide with some object by a collision prediction system for example.

First when attaching of the seatbelt to the occupant s body is detected retraction of the seatbelt onto the reel shaft is started by the reel shaft with a constant seatbelt retraction driving force and this retraction is continued until the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit time period t . During this retraction the urging force which the occupant receives from the seatbelt gradually increases while the retracting speed of the seatbelt onto the reel shaft gradually decreases.

Thereafter when the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit time point c the retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft is stopped and then protraction of the seatbelt can be effected due to a restitution force against the bias force of the spiral spring etc. that is a restitution force of the occupant s body and clothes urged by the seatbelt. During this protraction the acceleration of protraction of the seatbelt from the reel shaft increases.

Since when the retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft reaches its limit after the attaching of the seatbelt and the retracting motion stops however the seatbelt is suddenly returned in the direction in which the urging force is weakened due to the restitution force of the occupant s body and clothes urged by the seatbelt the acceleration of protraction of the seatbelt from the reel shaft suddenly increases and can exceed a threshold value required for locking the protracting motion of the seatbelt so that the protracting motion of the seatbelt can be locked by a seatbelt locking mechanism. As a result the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt cannot be relieved after a time point when it assumes a large value time point d time period t .

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus is also already known which is provided with an airbag device for restraining an occupant through expansion of an airbag a belt pretentioner for restraining the occupant by suddenly retracting a seatbelt an airbag and pretensioner controller for controlling actuation time and expansion pressure of the airbag and actuation time and seatbelt pulling force of the pretensioner and a sensor for detecting negative acceleration acted upon the occupant upon a collision of the automotive vehicle.

When negative acceleration acted upon the occupant is detected by the sensor upon a collision of the automotive vehicle a signal indicative of the negative acceleration from the sensor is delivered to the airbag and pretensioner controller which in turn controls the actuation time and expansion pressure of the airbag and actuation time and seatbelt winding force of the pretensioner whereby the airbag and the pretensioner are actuated.

In the known automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus however the actuation time and expansion pressure of the airbag are controlled by the airbag and pretensioner controller upon a collision of the automotive vehicle irrespective of the protracting speed of the seatbelt. Consequently for example when it is judged by the controller that the actuation times for actuating the airbag and the pretensioner should be set to longer values the airbag and the pretensioner are actuated with the longer actuation times even in the event that the protracting speed of the seatbelt is so high that the occupant can collide against equipment within the compartment.

Further when it is judged by the controller that the expansion pressure for actuating the airbag should be set to a higher value the expansion pressure of the airbag cannot be changed according to the protracting speed of the airbag even in the event that the protracting speed of the seatbelt is so high and the occupant is restrained by the airbag expanded under such a higher expansion pressure that the occupant can directly receive a large impact applied to the vehicle.

Also conventionally there is known a mechanism called EA mechanism load limiter which has a function of causing the reel shaft to rotate in the direction of protracting the seatbelt when a tension in excess of a prescribed value is applied to the seatbelt immediately after a collision of the automotive vehicle so as to control the tension to or below the prescribed value hereinafter referred to as the EA function . The EA function is terminated when the seatbelt is protracted by a certain length after the EA function is made effective. That is the EA function is carried out irrespective of the degree of magnitude of collision of the automotive vehicle. Consequently in the event of a strong collision of the automotive vehicle for example the EA function can be terminated even at a time point when it is desired that the same function should be still exhibited whereby a sudden impact can be applied to the occupant after termination of the EA function which can result in insufficient effective absorption of an impact acted upon the occupant. On the other hand in the event of a weak collision of the automotive vehicle a tensile strength in excess of the prescribed value is not applied to the seatbelt so that the EA function is not made effective whereby impact absorption cannot be obtained.

Fault diagnosis of the seatbelt locking mechanism has conventionally been carried out through a determination by the occupant or the like as to whether the seatbelt can be actually retracted and protracted or as to whether the seatbelt can be locked in position by suddenly protracting the same.

This manner of fault diagnosis however cannot always achieve accurate fault determination of the seatbelt locking mechanism.

Further in the conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus when the occupant with the seatbelt not mounted on his body pulls out the seatbelt without the intention of attaching the same to his body immediately then gets off the vehicle and closes the door the seatbelt is not retracted within a short time period so that the seatbelt can be caught in the door to be damaged. Also when during parking of the automotive vehicle the seatbelt is pulled out and attached to a baggage or the like into the mounted state of the seatbelt and then in this state the door is closed the seatbelt can be also caught in the door if the seatbelt is then unnecessarily loosened.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus is also already known which detects a possibility of collision of the automotive vehicle based upon the distance between the occupant s vehicle and a preceding vehicle and gives an alarm to alert the occupant to the danger of collision based upon the detection result so as to prevent a traffic accident.

An example of the apparatus having such a warning function is disclosed by Japanese Laid Open Utility Model Publication Kokai No. 6 71333 which is adapted to intermittently increase or decrease the fastening force of the seatbelt when it is detected that the distance between vehicles becomes shorter than a predetermined safety distance.

In the known automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus however the control of intermittent increase or decrease of the fastening force is carried out in a monotonous manner irrespective of the degree of possibility of expected danger so long as the distance between vehicles is less than the safety distance. Consequently when the degree of possibility of expected danger is low the above control can be annoying to the occupant whereas when the degree is high the same control is insufficient and unsatisfactory to him. Thus the above control is not fully effective to warn the occupant of expected danger.

There is also conventionally known an automotive vehicle having a function of storing upon a collision of the automotive vehicle the value of acceleration caused by the collision and the collision speed in order to utilize the stored data in clearing up the cause of the accident for example.

In the known automotive vehicle however it is the value of acceleration caused by the collision and the collision speed that are stored but not information parameters related to the automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus. Therefore it is not easy to judge whether the automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus properly operated upon the collision and how the occupant behaved just before and or after the collision for example.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus is also known which is provided with an electric retractor which rotates a reel shaft by means of a driving force of an electric motor to protract and retract a seatbelt.

An example of the automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus provided with such an electric retractor is disclosed by Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Kokai No. 59 45240 which is adapted to control the driving of the electric motor based upon an output from a displacement detecting device which detects displacement of the seatbelt in retracting and protracting directions as well as an output from an attaching detecting device which detects attaching of the seatbelt to the occupant s body.

The electric retractor however requires the displacement detecting device which is expensive and therefore has an increased manufacturing cost and a complicated construction.

Further the rotation control of the electric motor of the electric retractor is carried out by applying constant voltage of negative and positive signs to the motor to cause normal rotation and reverse rotation of the motor as disclosed by Japanese Laid Open Utility Model. Publication Kokai No. 61 134464.

According to the known electric retractor however since the motor is rotated in the normal direction or in the reverse direction depending upon the application of the constant voltage there is a possibility that in retracting the seatbelt the seatbelt is suddenly wound up by the motor so that a tongue of the seatbelt hits against a side window pane.

Another electric retractor is disclosed by Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Kokoku No. 3 79212 in which a retracting force is stored in a return spring second retracting force generating device utilizing the protracting motion of the seatbelt and when the motor output drops below a predetermined value such that the motor cannot retract the seatbelt for example due to failure of an electrical system for driving the motor first retracting force generating device or a drop in the motor torque due to a drop in the electromotive force of a battery installed in the automotive vehicle a rotative force transmission device transmits the retracting force stored in the return spring to a takeup shaft of the seatbelt. This assures retraction of the seatbelt even when the seatbelt cannot be wound up by the motor.

According to this retractor however the motor first retracting force generating device or the return spring second retracting force generating device is selected to retract the seatbelt by the rotative force transmission device that is the two devices are not simultaneously used for retraction of the seatbelt which requires designing each of the motor and the return spring so as to produce a strong retracting force by itself.

Besides in the retractor if the retracting force of the motor becomes weakened due to aging change etc. so that the motor cannot fully retract the seatbelt the motor is switched to the return spring for retracting the seatbelt. However in fact the retracting force of the motor is merely weakened but not reduced to zero. Therefore if the motor is switched to the return spring for retracting the seatbelt the retracting force remaining in the motor cannot be fully utilized.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus is also known from Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication Kokai No. 9 82171 which turns on or off a switch for detecting an amount of retraction of a seatbelt on a reel shaft depending upon the thickness of a portion of the seatbelt wound on the reel shaft to thereby detect an amount of protracting of the seatbelt or the amount of retraction of the same to use the detected value in controlling an electric circuit for warning the occupant of failure to fasten the seatbelt or in controlling a seatbelt locking mechanism provided in a seatbelt retractor.

In the seatbelt retraction detecting switch however since the amount of protraction or amount of retraction of the seatbelt is detected by turning on or turning off of the seatbelt retraction amount detecting switch only information as to whether the seatbelt has been wound up or pulled out by a predetermined amount or more can be obtained and a specific value of the protracting amount or retraction amount cannot be obtained.

The above and other objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention will now be described in detail with reference to drawings showing embodiments thereof.

Referring first to there is shown the arrangement of an automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a first embodiment of the invention. The apparatus according to the first embodiment is provided with a seatbelt retractor .

The seatbelt retractor has a frame in which is rotatably mounted a reel shaft takeup shaft for retracting and protracting a seatbelt. Secured to an end of the reel shaft is a known seatbelt locking mechanism which is adapted to lock or stop the seatbelt from being protracted when a predetermined or higher degree of deceleration is applied to an automotive vehicle in which the present apparatus is installed or when the seatbelt is protracted at a predetermined or higher degree of acceleration.

The reel shaft has a central shaft coupled to a central shaft of a reel shaft pulley which is in turn coupled to a DC motor pulley via a power transmission belt . Provided inside the reel shaft pulley is bias force imparting means formed e.g. of a spiral spring not shown which always applies a bias force to the pulley in a direction of retraction of the seatbelt.

The reel shaft pulley and the DC motor pulley each have an outer periphery thereof formed with a predetermined number of outer teeth while the power transmission belt has an inner periphery thereof formed with a predetermined number of inner teeth which are in mesh with the outer teeth of the reel shaft pulley and the DC motor pulley .

The DC motor pulley has a central shaft thereof coupled to a DC motor such that the rotation of the DC motor is transmitted to the reel shaft via the DC motor pulley .

The DC motor is fixed to the frame at at least two points thereof and is connected to an MPU Micro Processing Unit via a DC motor driver .

The MPU controls the operative state of the DC motor by changing the duty ratio of a PWM Pulse Width Modulation signal for use in the control for example. The MPU detects current flowing to the DC motor or terminal voltage across the DC motor for the control of the DC motor . The duty ratio of the PWM signal is determined based upon detected current flowing to the DC motor or detected terminal voltage across the DC motor .

If the current flowing to the motor DC or the terminal voltage across the DC motor is directly detected however the following operative state of the DC motor cannot be accurately determined based upon such detected current or voltage because the detected current or voltage contains fluctuations or pulsations due to high frequency components contained in the PWM signal.

Therefore in as described hereinbelow the MPU detects the current flowing to the DC motor and the terminal voltage across the DC motor based on the voltage signals obtained by low pass filters.

In reference numeral C designates a current detecting circuit which detects current i flowing to the DC motor based upon current flowing through a resistance r. The current detecting circuit C is comprised of interface circuits hereinafter abbreviated as IFs IF and IF which operate to remove current fluctuations or variations due to the influence of the PWM signal. The MPU receives voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF and detects current i flowing to the DC motor from these voltage signals.

In reference numeral C designates a voltage measuring circuit which measures terminal voltage across the DC motor and is comprised of IFs IF and IF which operate to remove fluctuations or variations in the terminal voltage due to the influence of the PWM signal. The MPU receives voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF and measures the terminal voltage across the DC motor from these voltage signals.

The IFs IF to IF are each formed by a low pass filter formed of a resistance r a resistance r smaller in resistance value than the resistance r and a capacitor c all the IFs having a cutoff frequency of 20 Hz for example. By virtue of these IFs the influence of the PWM signal output from the MPU upon the current detecting circuit C and the voltage measuring circuit C is reduced to 60 dB which is almost negligible for detection of current by the current detecting circuit C and detection of terminal voltage by the voltage measuring circuit C.

Moreover the MPU conducts averaging filtering or the like on the detected current or voltage by means of software to remove fluctuations or pulsations attributed to the PWM signal.

First when the PWM signal having a duty ratio of 50 and a frequency of 20 kHz as shown in is input through the terminal P or P the voltage signal output through the terminal P has high maximal voltage v due to the influence of the PWM signal input through the terminal P or P as shown in if the low pass filter IF is not provided.

On the other hand if the low pass filter IF is provided as in the present embodiment the voltage signal output through the terminal P has low constant voltage v 2 which is free of the influence of the PWM signal input through the terminal P or P as shown in .

As described above according to the present embodiment the current i flowing to the DC motor and the terminal voltage across the DC motor are detected based on the voltage signals obtained by the low pass filters. As a result the current flowing to the DC motor and the terminal voltage across the DC motor have much reduced fluctuations caused by the influence of the PWM signal. Further the use of the low pass filters greatly reduces the burden upon the MPU making it possible to quickly and accurately control the motor using a low cost MPU.

Referring back to connected to the MPU are a buckle connection detector which detects whether a tongue of the seatbelt has been attached to or mounted on the buckle and whether the tongue of the seatbelt has been disconnected from the buckle a mode selector which selects a mode of rotation control of the reel shaft and a temperature sensor which detects temperature in the vicinity of the DC motor or the temperature of the DC motor itself.

Further connected to the MPU is an MPU provided in a traveling condition detector which detects a traveling condition of the automotive during driving of the vehicle. Connected to the MPU are a distance sensor which detects the distance between the present vehicle occupant s vehicle and an object lying ahead of the vehicle and a steering angle sensor which senses the steering angle of a steering arm of the vehicle. The MPU has a built in timer for measuring time.

The mode selector can select a default mode for holding the degree of slackness or looseness of the seatbelt at a level comfortable to the occupant based upon a control signal from the traveling condition detector and further if required forcibly removing the slackness or forcibly imparting oppression to the occupant or alternately forcibly removing the slackness and forcibly imparting oppression to the occupant. Further the mode selector can select a doze preventing function adding mode for additionally providing a function of imparting alternately oppression and slackness at irregular time intervals and a rough road traveling function adding mode for additionally providing a function of removing the slackness or looseness of the seatbelt so as to make the seatbelt difficult to protract in addition to the default mode. These modes can be selected by the occupant. Initially the mode selector selects the default mode.

Next the flow of control signals at various components of the automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to the present embodiment will be described.

The distance sensor delivers an output signal indicative of results of detection of the distance between the present vehicle and an object lying ahead of the vehicle to the MPU . The MPU calculates a safety distance ds m between the present vehicle and an object lying ahead by the use of the following formula 1 and when the calculated safety distance ds is larger than a value indicated by the output signal from the distance sensor the MPU delivers a control signal for collision danger warning to the MPU . Further the MPU calculates a collision unavoidable distance dd m by the use of the following formula 2 and when the calculated collision unavoidable distance dd is larger than a value indicated by the output signal from the distance sensor the MPU delivers a signal indicative of a collision being unavoidable to the MPU . 1 2 where Vr represents relative speed m sec td response delay of the driver e.g. 0.5 to 2 sec and a value determined by the braking characteristic of the vehicle e.g. 0.5 to 2 sec .

The steering angle sensor delivers an output signal indicative of the sensed steering angle to the MPU and when the maximum value of change amount in the detected steering angle within a prescribed time period e.g. 2 sec is less than a predetermined value e.g. 8 degrees the MPU judges that the driver might be dozing and delivers a control signal for doze warning to the MPU .

The buckle connection detector detects whether the tongue of the seatbelt has been connected to the buckle and delivers an output signal indicative of results of the detection to the MPU . The DC motor driver controls the rotation of the DC motor based upon a control signal from the MPU .

The mode selector delivers an output signal indicative of the selected mode to the MPU which in turn delivers a control signal corresponding to the selected mode to the DC motor driver to control the seatbelt retractor .

The temperature sensor delivers an output signal indicative of the temperature in the vicinity of the DC motor or the temperature of the DC motor itself to the MPU .

First the MPU executes seatbelt protraction control for protracting the seatbelt at a step S. Details of the seatbelt protraction control will be described hereinafter with reference to .

Then the MPU executes buckle attaching control at a step S. The buckle attaching control is executed when attaching of the tongue of the seatbelt to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector as described hereinafter with reference to .

Then when the MPU detects that the present vehicle is about to collide against an object lying ahead that collision of the present vehicle with an object lying ahead is unavoidable or that the driver is dozing the MPU carries out collision warning collision unavoidableness and doze warning control at a step S. Details of this control will be described hereinafter with reference to .

Then the MPU carries out movement control at a step S. The movement control is executed when protraction of the seatbelt has been detected while the rotation of the reel shaft is in stoppage as described hereinafter with reference to .

Then the MPU executes mode selecting control according to the mode selected by the mode selector at a step S. Details of the mode selecting control will be described hereinafter with reference to .

Further the MPU executes retraction stopping control for preventing excessive retraction of the seatbelt at a step S. Details of the retraction stopping control will be described hereinafter with reference to .

Then it is determined at a step S whether the tongue of the seatbelt has been disconnected from the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If the disconnection has not been detected the processing returns to the step S whereas if the disconnection has been detected the MPU executes seatbelt storing control at a step S. Details of the seatbelt storing control will be described hereinafter with reference to .

Then the MPU executes seatbelt retraction failure detecting control at a step S followed by the processing returning to the step S. The seatbelt retraction failure detecting control is carried out when the tongue of the seatbelt is disconnected from the buckle and retracted as described hereinafter with reference to . In this connection when the seatbelt retraction failure detecting control has been started the built in timer of the MPU starts measuring time t elapsed after the start of the control.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the tongue of the seatbelt to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has been detected the MPU judges that protraction of the seatbelt has been completed and delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S followed by terminating the present processing. On the other hand if attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to temporarily stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver in order to assist protraction of the seatbelt at a step S.

Then the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the sign thereof are measured by the circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S. It is determined whether the measured terminal voltage exceeds 0.3 volts and at the same time the sign of the terminal voltage corresponds to the direction of protracting the seatbelt at a step S. The answer to this question becomes affirmative YES if the occupant lightly protracts the seatbelt.

If it is determined at the step S that the terminal voltage does not exceed 0.3 volts or the sign does not correspond to the direction of protracting the seatbelt the processing returns to the step S whereas if the terminal voltage exceeds 0.3 volts and at the same time the sign of the terminal voltage corresponds to the direction of protracting the seatbelt the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S whereby the seatbelt can be easily protracted.

According to the control of the steps S to S described above when the measured terminal voltage exceeds 0.3 volts and at the same time the sign of the terminal voltage corresponds to the direction of protracting the seatbelt the seatbelt can be brought into a state where it can be easily protracted. As a result a large force as required in the conventional apparatus is not needed and therefore even a weak occupant who has degraded physical ability such as an advanced age occupant can easily mount the seatbelt onto his body.

Then it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the tongue of the seatbelt has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has been detected the processing proceeds to the step S On the other hand if attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 7 sec has elapsed after the control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft was delivered to the DC motor driver .

If the predetermined time period has not elapsed the processing returns to the step S whereas if it has elapsed which means that the seatbelt has been protracted but the tongue of the seatbelt has not been connected to the buckle such that the seatbelt is in a slackened state a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft is delivered to the DC motor driver at a step S and then the processing proceeds to the step S to carry out the seatbelt storing control.

First the MPU waits for a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec at a step S to give the occupant a time period for the occupant to correct torsion of the seatbelt or the like after the attaching of the tongue to the buckle. Upon the lapse of the predetermined time period the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S whereby the seatbelt is retracted. Then current flowing to the DC motor is measured by the circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S. It is determined at a step S whether the measured current exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 1.4 amperes .

If the measured current does not exceed the predetermined value the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter the MPU judges that the retraction of the seatbelt has almost reached its limit and then waits for a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec to allow the occupant to fit the seatbelt to his body at a step S. Upon the lapse of the predetermined time period the MPU delivers to the DC motor driver a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft after the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit at a step S.

Then the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. Accordingly the seatbelt starts to be protracted and after the lapse of a predetermined time period e.g. 1 sec step S when the seatbelt should be already given a predetermined amount of looseness the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the tongue of the seatbelt to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has been detected the present processing is terminated whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the processing proceeds to the step S to carry out the seatbelt storing control.

According to the seatbelt attaching control described above after the attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle the seatbelt is retracted and after the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit the seatbelt starts to be protracted to be given a predetermined amount of looseness. As a result the inconvenience with the conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus such that the seatbelt mounted on the occupant s body always gives the occupant a feeling of oppression owing to the bias force of the bias force imparting means and makes him uncomfortable can be eliminated.

First it is determined at a step S whether any one of a first signal giving warning of danger of collision a second signal indicative of unavoidableness of collision and a third signal giving warning against dozing has been received. If none of the signals has been received the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if any one of the signals has been received the kind of the received signal is determined at a step S.

If it is determined that the received signal is the second signal indicative of unavoidableness of collision the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted. Then the MPU waits for a predetermined time period e.g. 5 sec within which the restraint of the occupant immediately after collision should become unnecessary after the determination that a collision is unavoidable at a step S. Upon the lapse of the predetermined time period the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S.

On the other hand if it is determined at the step S that the received signal is the first signal giving warning of danger of collision or the third signal giving warning against dozing the MPU delivers a control signal having a frequency of 20 Hz and commanding to rotate the reel shaft alternately in the seatbelt retracting direction and in the seatbelt protracting direction at a step S. Accordingly the retraction of the seatbelt and the protraction of the same start to be alternately carried out and then the MPU waits for a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec as a warning time during which the alternate retraction and protraction is continued at a step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

Then the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S and then waits for a predetermined time period e.g. 1 sec at a step S. Upon the lapse of the predetermined time period when the seatbelt should be already given a predetermined amount of looseness the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

According to the collision warning collision unavoidableness and doze warning control described above when the received signal is a signal indicative of unavoidableness of a collision the seatbelt is retracted to thereby positively protect the occupant upon a collision of the vehicle and on the other hand when the received signal is a signal giving warning of danger of collision or a signal giving warning the occupant against dozing the seatbelt is alternately retracted and protracted to thereby enable warning the occupant of danger of collision or against dozing.

First the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the sign of the same are measured by the circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S. It is determined at a step S whether the measured terminal voltage exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 0.3 volts and at the same time the sign corresponds to the direction of protracting the seatbelt. The answer to this question is affirmative YES if the seatbelt is protracted due to a motion of the occupant with the seatbelt mounted on his body for example.

If the terminal voltage does not exceed the predetermined value or the sign of the terminal voltage does not correspond to the seatbelt protracting direction the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if the terminal voltage exceeds the predetermined value and at the same time the sign corresponds to the seatbelt protracting direction the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. By this control the seatbelt can be made easy to protract.

Then the MPU waits for a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec within which the occupant should stop moving after starting moving at a step S and upon the lapse of the predetermined time period the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S.

Then the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the sign of the same are measured by the circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S it is determined at a step S whether the measured terminal voltage exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 0.1 volts and the sign corresponds to the direction of retraction of the seatbelt. The answer to this question is affirmative YES if the occupant has returned to his original position after moving and accordingly the seatbelt has been retracted by the bias force imparting means formed of a spiral spring or the like.

If the answer to the question of the step S is affirmative YES the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted.

Then the current flowing to the DC motor is measured by the circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S and then it is determined at a step S whether the measured current exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 1.4 amperes .

If the measured current does not exceed the predetermined value the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter the MPU judges that the retraction of the seatbelt has almost reached its limit and then waits for a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec to allow the occupant to fit the seatbelt to his body. Upon the lapse of the predetermined time period after the retraction has reached its limit the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft at a step S.

Then the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. The MPU then waits for a predetermined time period e.g. 1 sec after the seatbelt starts to be protracted and upon the lapse of the same when the seatbelt should be already given a predetermined amount of looseness the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

If it is determined at the step S that the terminal voltage does not exceed the predetermined value or the sign of the same does not correspond to the seatbelt retracting direction it is determined at a step S whether the terminal voltage exceeds a second predetermined value e.g. 0.3 volts and at the same time the sign corresponds to the seatbelt protracting direction. The answer to this question is affirmative YES if the occupant again starts to move so that the seatbelt is protracted for example.

If it is determined at the step S that the terminal voltage exceeds the second predetermined value and at the same time the sign corresponds to the seatbelt protracting direction the processing returns to the step S whereas if the terminal voltage does not exceed the second predetermined value or if the sign does not correspond to the seatbelt protracting direction which means that the occupant remains stationary without moving again it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 7 sec has elapsed after the control signal commanding to stop the reel shaft started to be delivered to the DC motor driver .

If the predetermined time period has not elapsed the processing returns to the step S whereas if the same has elapsed the MPU judges that the occupant remains stationary without moving that is the occupant stays in the proper position and then the processing proceeds to the step S.

According to the movement control described above in the event that the occupant starts to move after the seatbelt has been attached to his body to cause the seatbelt to be protracted the protracting motion is assisted to facilitate the occupant s movement. Further when the occupant remains stationary for a predetermined time period e.g. 7 sec or longer after he moved it is judged that the occupant stays in the proper position and then retraction of the seatbelt is carried out. Still further when the occupant starts to return to his original position after he moved retraction of the seatbelt is carried out. Thus the occupant can be always protected with reliability.

First it is determined at a step S whether the mode selector has been caused by the occupant to select the doze preventing function adding mode. If this mode has been selected the MPU continuously delivers a control signal having a frequency of 20 Hz commanding to rotate the reel shaft alternately in the seatbelt retracting direction and in the seatbelt protracting direction at random time intervals of 30 to 300 sec to the DC motor driver for a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec at a step S. Thus retraction and protraction of the seatbelt are carried out alternately at irregular time intervals.

Then a flag S which when set to 1 indicates that the doze preventing function adding mode or the rough road traveling function adding mode has been selected is set to 1 at a step S followed by terminating the present processing. In this connection if the doze preventing function adding mode is selected the timer is started to measure the above random time intervals of 30 to 300 seconds. So long as the doze preventing function adding mode is not selected the timer is cleared.

On the other hand if it is determined at the step S that the doze preventing function adding mode has not been selected it is determined at a step S whether the occupant has caused the mode selector to select the rough road traveling function adding mode. If this mode has been selected the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted to fixedly hold the occupant to his seat.

If it is determined at the step S that the rough road traveling function adding mode has not been selected the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S and then determines at a step S whether the doze preventing function adding mode or the rough road traveling function adding mode was selected in the last time of mode selecting control that is whether the flag S was set to 1 in the last time of mode selecting control.

If it is determined at the step S that the flag S was not set to 1 the default mode continues to be selected followed by terminating the program. On the other hand if the flag S was set to 1 the flag S is reset to 0 at a step Step and the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted.

Then the current flowing to the DC motor is measured by the circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the measured current exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 1.4 amperes .

If the measured current does not exceed the predetermined value the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter the MPU judges that the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit and waits for a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec within which the occupant should fit the seatbelt to his body at a step S and upon the lapse of the predetermined time period delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S.

Then the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus upon the lapse of the predetermined time period step S when a predetermined amount of looseness should be already given to the seatbelt after the seatbelt starts to be protracted the MPU delivers a control signal to the DC motor driver to stop the rotation of the reel shaft step S followed by termination of the program.

According to the mode selecting control described above when the doze preventing function adding mode is selected the retraction and protraction of the seatbelt are alternately carried out at irregular time intervals to thereby enable preventing the occupant from dozing while driving the vehicle. Further when the rough road traveling function adding mode is selected the seatbelt is retracted to fix the occupant to his seat to thereby enable preventing the occupant from shaking even in traveling on a rough road and provide a safe driving condition.

First the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is protracted to be slackened.

Then the current flowing to the DC motor is measured by the circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the measured current is not smaller than a predetermined amount e.g. 0.24 amperes .

If the measured current is smaller than the predetermined amount the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former is not smaller than the latter the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S to thereby secure loosening of the seatbelt and inhibit retraction of the seatbelt due to the bias force of the bias force imparting means. Then the program is terminated.

According to the retraction stopping control when the current flowing to the DC motor is not smaller than the predetermined amount the rotation of the reel shaft is stopped to thereby secure loosening of the seatbelt and inhibit retraction of the seatbelt due to the bias force of the bias force imparting means.

First when the occupant has disconnected the tongue of the seatbelt from the buckle the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the sign of the same are measured by the circuit of the DC motor driver at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the measured terminal voltage exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 0.3 volts and at the same time the sign corresponds to the seatbelt retracting direction. The answer to this question is affirmative YES if the seatbelt has been retracted due to the bias force of the bias force imparting means and therefore retraction of the seatbelt through driving by the DC motor is not needed.

If the measured terminal voltage exceeds the predetermined value and at the same time the sign corresponds to the seatbelt retracting direction the processing returns to the step S whereas if the measured terminal voltage does not exceed the predetermined value or if the sign does not correspond to the seatbelt retracting direction that is if the seatbelt is no longer retracted due to the bias force of the bias force imparting means but retraction of the seatbelt by the driving force of the DC motor is needed it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the tongue of the seatbelt to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector .

If attaching of the seatbelt has been detected it is judged that although the tongue was once disconnected from the buckle the tongue has again been mounted onto the buckle and then the above described buckle attaching control step S is carried out whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted.

Then the current flowing to the DC motor is measured by the circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the measured current exceeds a predetermined amount e.g. 1.4 amperes .

If the measured current does not exceed the predetermined amount the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter the MPU judges that the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit and delivers a control signal commanding to stop the rotation of the reel shaft to the DC motor driver at a step S.

According to the seatbelt storing control described above when the seatbelt is no longer retracted by the bias force of the bias force imparting means but retraction of the seatbelt by the driving force of the DC motor is needed the answer is NO at the step S and at the same time the attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has not been detected the answer is NO at the step S the seatbelt is retracted by the driving force of the DC motor . Therefore after the seatbelt tongue has been disconnected from the buckle the seatbelt can be retracted without fail. As a result it can be avoided that the seatbelt tongue is caught in the door.

Although in the above seatbelt storing control if retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit such that the current flowing to the DC motor exceeds the predetermined value step S the control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to stop the rotation of the seatbelt step S alternatively the seatbelt may be protracted by the driving force of the DC motor for a predetermined time period so as to give a predetermined amount of slackness to the occupant and irrespective of whether the occupant thereafter protracts the seatbelt the seatbelt is again retracted to its limit and then protracted by the motor driving force so as to give a predetermined amount of slackness to the occupant to thereby eliminate an extra amount of looseness of the seatbelt and hence properly protect the occupant.

First the current i flowing to the DC motor is detected by the circuit C at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the detected current i exceeds a predetermined amount e.g. 1.4 amperes .

If the detected current i does not exceed the predetermined amount it is judged that the retraction of the seatbelt is being carried out normally and a time t elapsed after the start of the present control is reset to 0 at a step S followed by terminating the present processing. On the other hand if the detected current i exceeds the predetermined amount the elapsed time t is incremented by 1 at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the elapsed time t exceeds a predetermined time period e.g. 60 sec .

If the elapsed time t does not exceed the predetermined time period it is judged that the retraction of the seatbelt is being carried out normally followed by terminating the present processing whereas if the former exceeds the latter it is judged that the retraction of the seatbelt is being carried out abnormally and the supply of supply voltage to the DC motor from the battery Vb is stopped to stop the retraction of the seatbelt followed by terminating the present processing.

According to the seatbelt retraction failure detecting control described above when the current i flowing to the DC motor continuously exceeds the predetermined amount over the predetermined time period the answers are YES at the steps S and S it is judged that the retraction of the seatbelt is being carried out abnormally and then the supply of supply voltage to the DC motor is stopped step S to stop the retraction of the seatbelt whereby the occurrence of a fault due to the retraction of the seatbelt can be prevented.

As described above according to the first embodiment the MPU carries out the seatbelt protraction control buckle attaching control collision warning collision unavoidableness and doze warning control movement control mode selecting control retraction stopping control seatbelt storing control and seatbelt retraction failure control. As a result a comfortable seatbelt attaching environment can be provided and the occupant can be warned of danger to thereby positively protect the occupant.

The above kinds of control carried out by the MPU are executed at least one time after the occupant mounts the seatbelt onto his body and until he dismounts the seatbelt from his body.

The automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to the present embodiment may be provided at any of the driving seat the assistant driving seat and the back seats.

The values of the waiting time by the MPU terminal voltage across the DC motor and currrent flowing to the DC motor used in the present emobodiment as described above are given by way of example and not limitative.

Second to thirtieth embodiments of the invention will be described hereinbelow. In the description of these embodiments elements and parts as well as steps corresponding to those in the first embodiment described above are designated by identical reference numerals detailed description of which is omitted. In the following only those which differ from the first embodiment will be described.

The second embodiment is distinguished from the above described first embodiment only in that it is provided with a mechanism for stopping the retraction of the seatbelt and .

The reel shaft has a central shaft coupled to a central shaft of a retraction stopping gear which is rotatable in the same direction as the reel shaft and has an outer periphery thereof formed with a predetermined number of outer teeth. The gear has a teeth surface facing in the seatbelt retracting direction which extends almost normally to the seat belt and a teeth surface facing in the seatbelt protracting direction which extends at a gentle inclination relative to the seatbelt.

The gear has a stopper arm for stopping retraction of the seatbelt which is normally biased by a coiled spring or the like in such a direction that retraction of the seatbelt cannot be stopped by the stopper arm and lifted by the action of a stopper arm driving solenoid when retraction of the seatbelt is to be stopped. In the lifted position the stopper arm is in mesh with the outer teeth of the gear to stop the retraction of the seatbelt.

When the gear is rotated in the seatbelt protracting direction the seatbelt can be protracted by virtue of the above mentioned teeth profile of the gear even when the gear is in mesh with the stopper arm .

The solenoid driver actuates the stopper arm driving solenoid in response to a control signal from the MPU to lift up the stopper arm into mesh with the outer teeth of the retraction stopping gear to thereby stop the retraction stopping gear .

The mode selector delivers an output signal corresponding to the selected mode to the MPU which in turn delivers a control signal corresponding to the selected mode to the DC motor driver and the solenoid driver to control the seatbelt retractor .

In the present embodiment the MPU controls the electric retractor based upon a main control program which is basically identical with the control program of employed the first embodiment except for the buckle attaching control collision warning collision unavoidableness and doze warning control movement control mode selecting control and seatbelt storing control. In the following description only different points of these controls from the first embodiment will be described.

After waiting for the predetermined time period e.g. 1 sec at the step S the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to drive the stopper arm driving solenoid to the solenoid driver to thereby stop the rotation of the gear at the step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

Even by the above described buckle attaching control according to the present invention similar results to those obtained by the buckle attaching control of according to the first embodiment can be obtained.

If it is determined at the step S that the received signal is the second signal indicative of a collision being unavoidable the MPU delivers to the solenoid driver a control signal commanding to deenergize the stopper arm driving solenoid so as not to lift up the stopper arm and hence allow the retraction stopping gear to be rotatively driven at the step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

On the other hand if it is determined at the step S that the received signal is the first signal giving warning of danger of collision or the third signal giving warning against doze the MPU delivers to the solenoid driver a control signal commanding to deenergize the stopper arm driving solenoid so as not to lift up the stopper arm and hence allow the retraction stopping gear to be rotatively driven at the step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

After waiting for the predetermined time period e.g. 1 sec at the step S the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to energize the stopper arm driving solenoid to the solenoid driver to thereby stop the rotation of the retraction stopping gear at the step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

Even by the above described collision warning collision unavoidableness and doze warning control according to the present embodiment similar results to those obtained by the control of according to the first embodiment can be obtained.

After executing the step S the MPU delivers to the solenoid driver a control signal commanding to deenergize the stopper arm driving solenoid so as not to lift up the stopper arm and hence allow the retraction stopping gear to be rotatively driven at the step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

After waiting for the predetermined time period e.g. 1 sec at the step S the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to energize the stopper arm driving solenoid to the solenoid driver to thereby stop the rotation of the retraction stopping gear at the step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

Even by the movement control according to the present embodiment similar results to those obtained by the above described movement control according to the first embodiment can be obtained.

If it is determined at the step S that the rough road traveling function adding mode has been selected the MPU delivers to the solenoid driver a control signal commanding to deenergize the stopper arm driving solenoid so as not to lift up the stopper arm and hence allow the retraction stopping gear to be rotatively driven at the step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

After waiting for the predetermined time period e.g. 1 sec at the step S the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to energize the stopper arm driving solenoid to the solenoid driver to thereby stop the rotation of the retraction stopping gear at the step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

Even by the mode selecting control according to the present invention results similar to those obtained by the mode selecting control according to the first embodiment can be obtained.

First after the seatbelt tongue has been disconnected from the buckle the MPU delivers to the solenoid driver a control signal commanding to deenergize the stopper arm driving solenoid so as not to lift up the stopper arm and hence allow the retraction stopping gear to be rotatively driven at the step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S.

If it is determined at the step S that the measured terminal voltage exceeds the predetermined value and at the same time the sign corresponds to the seatbelt retracting direction it is determined at the step S whether attaching of the the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector within a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec after the MPU delivered to the solenoid driver the control signal commanding to deenergize the stopper arm driving solenoid so as not to lift up the stopper arm and hence allow the retraction stopping gear to be rotatively driven at the step S.

If it is determined that the attaching has been detected the aforedescribed buckle attaching control step S is executed whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the processing proceeds to the step S.

Even by the seatbelt storing control according to the present embodiment similar results to those obtained by the seatbelt storing control according to the first embodiment can be obtained.

As described above according to the second embodiment similarly to the first embodiment the MPU carries out the seatbelt protraction control buckle attaching control collision warning collision unavoidableness and doze warning control movement control mode selecting control retraction stopping control seatbelt storing control and seatbelt retraction failure control. As a result a comfortable seatbelt attaching environment can be provided and the occupant can be warned of danger to thereby positively protect the occupant.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a third embodiment of the invention includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor employed by the first embodiment except that the bias force imparting means is omitted and therefore illustration and description of the same are omitted.

The third embodiment is distinguished from the first embodiment in the manner of seatbelt protraction control. The seatbelt protraction control according to the third embodiment will be described hereinbelow.

First at a step S the terminal voltage V across the DC motor is measured by the voltage measuring circuit C while opposite terminals of the DC motor are open. It is determined at a step S whether the measured terminal voltage V exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 0.3 volts .

If the terminal voltage v is not higher than the predetermined value the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus retraction of the seatbelt is assisted.

In the following description it is assumed that Vk k 0 1 2 . . . represents the terminal voltage V across the DC motor and Vk Vk 1 represents a change amount V in the terminal voltage V. It is also assumed that the unit time time period up to time point in is 10 ms for example.

In over a time period a the terminal voltage Vk fluctuates in the form of a waveform. This is because the DC motor drives the reel shaft against the bias force of the bias force imparting means formed of the spiral spring or the like to assist protraction of the seatbelt by the occupant. On the other hand over a time period b in the figure the terminal voltage V exhibits a constant value that is it does not fluctuate. This is because the protraction of the seatbelt by the occupant is no longer carried out and accordingly the DC motor has stopped driving.

Referring back to time j and a suffix counter k for the terminal voltage Vk across the DC motor are reset at a step S and then the terminal voltage Vk is measured by the voltage measuring circuit C at a step S.

It is then determined at a step S whether the suffix counter assumes a value of 0. If it assumes 0 the count value of the suffix counter k is incremented by 1 at a step S. Then a time adjustment is carried out so as to measure the terminal voltage Vk at predetermined time intervals 10 ms at a step S followed by the processing returning to the step S. If it is determined at the step S that the suffix counter k does not assume 0 the change amount V Vk Vk 1 in the terminal voltage Vk per a predetermined time period 10 ms at a step S and the count value of the suffix counter k is incremented by 1 at a step S.

It is then determined at a step S whether the change amount V obtained at the step S is smaller than a predetermined amount e.g. 0.1 volts . If the change amount V exceeds the predetermined value that is if the protraction of the seatbelt is being carried out by the occupant the time j is reset at a step S and then it is determined at a step S that attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the processing returns to the step S whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the driving of the DC motor to the DC motor driver at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

If it is determined at the step S that the change amount V obtained at the step S is smaller than the predetermined amount that is the protraction of the seatbelt is not being carried out by the occupant the time j is incremented by 1 at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the time j exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 200 a threshold value of the time j . If the time j does not exceed 200 the determination of the step S is executed while if the former exceeds the latter the time j is reset at a step S and a control signal to stop the driving of the DC motor is delivered to the DC motor driver at a step S followed by the processing proceeding to the seatbelt storing control which is identical with the aforedescribed seatbelt storing control employed by the first embodiment and hence not described here.

As described above according to the present embodiment after the assistance to protraction of the seatbelt has been started step S a determination as to whether protraction of the seatbelt is being carried out is made based upon the change amount V in the terminal voltage Vk across the DC motor at predetermined time intervals 10 ms steps S to S . If the protraction of the seatbelt is not being carried out the answer is YES at the step S a determination as to whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected is repeated until the time j exceeds 200 that is until a time period 2 sec 10 ms 200 elapses after the above determination was first carried out step S . When the time period 2 sec has elapsed the control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to stop the driving of the DC motor step S followed by executing the seatbelt storing control. As a result if the occupant protracts the seatbelt without the intention of attaching the seatbelt onto his body it is possible to quickly retract the seatbelt to thereby perform the seatbelt storing operation in a manner closer to the occupant s intention and hence provide a comfortable seatbelt attaching environment.

Although in the present embodiment the change amount V Vk Vk 1 in the terminal voltage Vk across the DC motor is used in the determination as to whether protraction of the seatbelt by the occupant is being carried out alternatively the magnitude of the terminal voltage Vk the magnitude of current flowing to the DC motor or a change amount i in the current may be used in the above determination providing substantially the same results.

An automotive vehicle passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a fourth embodiment of the invention is identical in construction with the apparatus according to the first embodiment and illustration and description of the same are omitted. The fourth embodiment is distinguished from the first embodiment in the contents of control carried out by the MPU .

The seat has one lateral side edge thereof provided with a buckle secured to the seat for connecting with a tongue of a seatbelt. At the opposite lateral side of the seat one end of the seatbelt is fixed to a chassis of the vehicle by attaching means. When the tongue is attached to the buckle the seatbelt restrains and protects the occupant by a shoulder portion and a lap portion thereof. The seatbelt is retracted by the electric retractor through the tongue and a through portion thereof.

Control of a force of the electric retractor for retracting the seatbelt is carried out by controlling the driving force of the DC motor . When the retracting force of the electric retractor is large looseness of the shoulder portion and lap portion of the seatbelt can be removed while it is small looseness of the shoulder portion can be removed.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the same determination is repeatedly executed whereas if it has been detected the MPU delivers a PWM signal commanding to cause current i flow to the DC motor so as to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted to remove looseness of the shoulder portion and lap portion . The retracting force of the DC motor generated on this occasion is equal to the retracting force of the same obtained at a step S hereinafter referred to.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit based upon the current i flowing to the DC motor . If the retraction has not reached its limit the processing returns to the step S to continue the retraction of the seatbelt whereas if the retraction has reached its limit that is if the seatbelt has become fit to the occupant s body a PWM signal is delivered from the MPU commanding to cause the current i to flow to the DC motor to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction so as to give a predetermined amount of looseness to the seatbelt at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is protracted. The protracting force of the DC motor generated on this occasion is equal to the protracting force of the same obtained at a step S hereinafter referred to.

Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period t e.g. 1 sec has elapsed after the PWM was delivered at the step S based upon the value of the timer If the predetermined time period t has not elapsed that is if the predetermined amount of looseness has not yet been given the processing returns to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period t has elapsed it is determined at a step S whether a count value N of a counter is smaller than a predetermined value N e.g. 2 . The counter counts a number of times of execution of a process for removing an extra looseness of the seatbelt seatbelt retracting process executed at the step S hereinafter referred to and seatbelt protracting process executed at the step S hereinafter referred to . If the count value N is smaller than the predetermined value N it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period ts previously set to the timer has elapsed. The predetermined time period ts is set to a value corresponding to a time period over which the occupant should impede retraction of the seatbelt to set a proper amount of looseness and is set at a step S. The predetermined time period ts may be always set to a constant time period or may be set to a random time period each time it is set.

If it is determined at the step S that the count value N exceeds the predetermined value N or at the step S that the set predetermined time period ts has not elapsed it is determined at a step S whether protraction of the seatbelt has been made by the occupant based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor . Thus it is possible to determine whether protraction of the seatbelt has been carried out due to movement of the occupant with the seatbelt mounted on his body which takes place for example when the occupant once stops the vehicle and then slouches to look right and left ways for safety.

If no protraction of the seatbelt has been carried out the processing proceeds to a step S hereinafter referred to whereas if protraction of the seatbelt has been carried out it is determined at a step S whether the protraction of the seatbelt by the occupant has stopped based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor . If the protraction of the seatbelt by the occupant has not stopped the PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to cause the current i to flow to the DC motor so as to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted to remove looseness of the shoulder portion of the seatbelt. The retracting force of the DC motor obtained on this occasion is controlled by the MPU to a smaller value than the retracting force obtained at the step S. This is because the retraction of the seatbelt effected at the step S corresponds to protraction of the seatbelt which takes place for example when the occupant slouches to look right and left ways for safety and if on such an occasion the seatbelt is retracted with the same force as the retracting force obtained at the step S it gives a feeling of unnaturalness to the occupant.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the retraction of the seatbelt can still be carried out based upon the current i flowing to the DC motor . If the retraction of the seatbelt can still be carried out the count value N is cleared at a step S whereas if the retraction cannot be carried out that is if the occupant has not yet returned from his slouching position it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period t e.g. 5 sec has elapsed after the first affirmative determination result at the step S based upon the value of the timer . If the predetermined time period t has not elapsed the processing returns to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period t has elapsed the processing proceeds to the step S.

Then the PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to cause the current i to flow to the DC motor to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction so as to remove looseness of the shoulder portion and lap portion occurring due to the occupant slouching or the like at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit based upon the current i flowing to the DC motor . If the retraction has not reached its limit the processing returns to the step S to continue the retraction of the seatbelt whereas if the retraction has reached its limit that is the seatbelt has become fit to the occupant s body the PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to cause the current i to flow to the DC motor to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction so as to give a predetermined amount of looseness to the seatbelt at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is protracted.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the predetermined time period t has elapsed based upon the value of the timer . If the predetermined time period t has not elapsed that is the predetermined amount of looseness has not yet been given to the seatbelt and therefore the processing returns to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period t has elapsed it is determined at the step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has been detected the processing returns to the step S whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected that is if the seatbelt is not attached to the buckle seatbelt storing control is executed at a step S to control the DC motor so as to store the seatbelt in its retracted position followed by the processing returning to the step S. The seatbelt storing control is identical with the one described before with reference to of the first embodiment description of which is therefore omitted.

If it is determined at the step S that the predetermined time period ts has elapsed the time period ts is set for the next time of control at a step S and the count value N is incremented by 1 at the step S followed by the proceeding to the step S.

As described above according to the present embodiment after the attaching of the seatbelt the answer is YES at the step S the seatbelt is retracted to its limit and then protracted over a predetermined time period steps S to S to give a predetermined amount of slackness to the occupant and then irrespective of whether the occupant has protracted the seatbelt the answer is YES and NO at the step S the seatbelt is again retracted to its limit and then protracted over a predetermined time period steps S to S to give a predetermined amount of slackness to the occupant. As a result an extra looseness of the seatbelt can be removed to thereby properly protect the occupant.

The electric retractor includes a vehicle speed sensor and a collision predictor which are connected to the MPU but the mode selector the temperature sensor and the traveling condition detector in are omitted. Further the MPU has timers and provided therein in addition to the timer . The electric retractor does not have bias force imparting means as employed in the electric retractor .

The vehicle speed sensor senses the traveling speed of the automotive vehicle and delivers an output signal indicative of the sensed traveling speed to the MPU . The collision predictor determines whether there is a possibility of the vehicle colliding with an object lying ahead and whether the collision is unavoidable and delivers an output signal indicative of results of the determinations to the MPU .

First a counter n is set to 0 and a seatbelt storage flag is reset at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector .

If attaching of the seatbelt has been detected the timer is started at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether retraction of the seatbelt has been carried out based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor . If the retraction has been carried out the timer is stopped and cleared at a step S and the seatbelt storage flag is set at a step S followed by the processing returning to the step S. On the other hand if the retraction of the seatbelt has not been made it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period t e.g. 4 sec has elapsed based upon the value of the timer . If the predetermined time period t has not elapsed the processing returns to the step S whereas if it has elapsed the timer is stopped and cleared at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the seatbelt storage flag is in the set state.

If the seatbelt storage flag is set the same flag is reset at a step S and the seatbelt storing control of is executed at a step S followed by the processing returning to the step S.

If it is determined at the step S that the seatbelt storage flag is not set it is determined at a step S whether the count value of the counter n is 5 or more. If the count value is 5 or more the processing returns to the step S whereas it is less than 5 the seatbelt storing control is executed at a step S. After completion of the seatbelt storing control the count value of the counter n is incremented by 1 at a step S and then the processing returns to the step S.

If it is determined at the step S that attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector a timer interrupt triggered in response to the value of the timer is made effective at a step S whereby timer interrupt processing is executed at predetermined time intervals e.g. 0.1 sec as described hereinafter. Then seatbelt slackening control is executed so as to prevent the occupant from feeling a sense of oppression and give a proper amount of looseness to him.

First a PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit based upon the current flowing to the DC motor . Thus an improper amount of looseness of the seatbelt can be once completely removed.

If it is determined at the step S that the retraction of the seatbelt has not reached its limit the processing returns to the step S whereas if it has reached the limit a PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period t e.g. 1 sec has elapsed after the protraction of the seatbelt by the DC motor was started. Thus a proper amount of looseness is given to the occupant.

If it is determined at the step S that the predetermined time period t has not elapsed the processing returns to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period t has elapsed the protraction of the seatbelt by the DC motor is stopped at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

Referring again to it is determined at a step S whether protraction of the seatbelt has been made based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor . If protraction of the seatbelt has not been made the same determination is repeated whereas if protraction of the seatbelt has been made it is determined at a step S whether the protraction of the seatbelt has been completed based upon results of a comparison between the terminal voltage across the DC motor and a predetermined value e.g. 0.3 volts . If the protraction of the seatbelt has not been completed the same determination is repeated whereas if it has been completed it is determined at a step S whether the vehicle speed v exceeds a predetermined value v e.g. 10 km h based upon an output signal from the vehicle speed sensor .

If the vehicle speed v does not exceed the predetermined value v the same determination is repeated whereas if the former exceeds the latter the processing returns to the step S to again execute the seatbelt slackening control. By virtue of this control when the vehicle is reversed at a slow speed for parking for example the reel shaft is not normally rotated and therefore it can be prevented that the seatbelt is retracted to its limit while the occupant looks backward.

First upon the start of execution of the timer interrupt processing the timer interrupt is made ineffective at a step S. Then it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the counter n is reset to 0 and the seatbelt storage flag is reset at a step S and then the program jumps to a step S to execute the seatbelt storing control of the step S.

On the other hand if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected it is determined at a step S whether an output signal from the collision predictor has been received which indicates that a collision of the vehicle is unavoidable. If the output signal has been received the PWM signal is delivered to the DC motor driver over a predetermined time period t e.g. 4 sec which is measured by the timer to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S. Thus the occupant can be properly protected in the event of a collision of the vehicle. Then the timer interrupt is made effective at a step S and the processing proceeds to the step S.

If it is determined at the step S that the output signal indicative of a collision of the vehicle being unavoidable has not been received it is determined at a step S whether an output signal from the collision predictor has been received which indicates that there is a fear of a collision of the vehicle. If the output signal has been received a PWM signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to rotate the DC motor alternately in the seatbelt protracting direction and in the seatbelt retracting direction to vibrate the seatbelt and a vibration flag is set at a step S. The frequency of the vibration varies from 1 Hz to 10 kHz so as to provide a vibration which the occupant can easily feel as a warning. Then the processing returns to the step S while the vibration is continued.

If it is determined at the step S that the output signal indicative of the fear of a collision of the vehicle has not been received it is determined at a step S whether the seatbelt has been being vibrated from the state of the vibration flag. If the seatbelt has been being vibrated the vibration flag is reset and the vibration is stopped at a step S and then the processing proceeds to the step S. If the seatbelt has not been being vibrated the timer interrupt is made effective at a step S and then the program return to a step where the timer interrupt was input.

As described above according to the present embodiment if it is determined that the vehicle speed is below the predetermined value v step S the seatbelt is retracted to its limit but the seatbelt slackening control is not executed thereafter while if the vehicle speed v exceeds the predetermined value v the seatbelt slackening control is executed steps S and S to S . As a result it can be prevented that the seatbelt is retracted to its limit while the occupant is looking backward and a proper amount of looseness can be imparted to the occupant to thereby enable restraint and protection of the occupant in a proper manner.

The electric retractor includes a vehicle reverse detector a vehicle speed sensor and a door opening closing detector which are connected to the MPU but the mode selector the temperature sensor and the traveling condition detector in are omitted. Further the MPU is formed by a type HD6433337YF made by Hitachi and the DC motor is formed by a type DME44SA made by Japan Servo Motors. The electric retractor does not have bias force imparting means as employed in the electric retractor .

The vehicle reverse detector detects a reverse of the automotive vehicle and generates an output signal indicative of the reverse to the MPU . The door opening closing detector detects opening or closing of a door of the automotive vehicle and delivers an output signal indicative of the opening or closing to the MPU .

The MPU determines whether the seatbelt has been protracted from the terminal voltage across the DC motor determines whether retraction of the seatbelt has been completed from the current i flowing to the DC motor and calculates an amount of protraction and an amount of retraction of the seatbelt.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has been detected seatbelt slackening control is executed at a step S.

The seatbelt slackening control is identical with that described before with reference to description of which is therefore omitted.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the seatbelt has been protracted based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor . If the seatbelt has not been protracted the processing proceeds to a step S hereinafter referred to whereas if it has been protracted it is determined at a step S whether the protraction of the seatbelt has been terminated based upon the terminal voltage. If the protraction of the seatbelt has not been terminated the same determination is repeated whereas if it has been terminated it is determined at a step S whether the door is open based upon the output signal from the door opening closing detector .

If the door is closed it is determined at a step S whether the vehicle speed v of the automotive vehicle exceeds the predetermined value v e.g. 10 km h . If the former exceeds the latter the seatbelt slackening control is executed at a step S similarly to the step S. Then it is determined at the step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector .

If it is determined at the step S that the door is open it is determined at a step S whether the automotive vehicle is reversing based upon the output signal from the vehicle reverse detector . If the vehicle is not reversing the processing proceeds to the step S. By virtue of this control when the occupant opens the door during parking of the vehicle and protracts the seatbelt in order to fix a baggage in position with the seatbelt for example the seatbelt is retracted whereby it can be prevented that the seatbelt is caught in the door.

On the other hand if it is determined at the step S that the vehicle is reversing a PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to inhibit the DC motor from rotating that is inhibit retraction of the seatbelt at a step S and then the processing proceeds to the step S. Thus when the occupant reverses the vehicle for parking with the door being open for example the retraction of the seatbelt is inhibited whereby it can be prevented that the occupant is given a sense of unnaturalness providing a comfortable seatbelt attaching environment.

If it is determined at the step S that the vehicle speed v is below the predetermined value v the processing proceeds to the step S. Thus when the occupant once stops the vehicle and then slouches to look right and left ways for safety so that the seatbelt is protracted the retraction of the seatbelt is inhibited whereby it is possible to allow the occupant to ascertain the safety without being given a sense of unnaturalness.

If it is determined at the step S that attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector the processing returns to the step S whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the count value of the counter n which counts a number of times of retraction of the seatbelt to its limit is reset to 0 at a step S and the PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S followed by determining at a step S whether the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit based upon the current flowing to the DC motor . Thus an improper amount of looseness of the seatbelt can once be completely removed. If it is determined at the step S that the retraction of the seatbelt has not reached its limit the processing returns to the step S whereas if the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit the count value of the counter n is incremented by 1 at a step S and then it is determined at a step S whether the count value of the counter n reaches a predetermined value n e.g. 3 . This determination is made in view of a case that while the seatbelt is being retracted it is caught by an arm of the occupant to stop being retracted.

If it is determined at the step S that the count value of the counter n is below the predetermined value n the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former is equal to or larger than the latter the processing returns to the step S.

If it is determined at the step S that attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has not been detected it is determined at a step S whether the seatbelt is being protracted based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor . If the seatbelt is not being protracted the processing returns to the step S whereas if it is being protracted it is determined at a step S whether the protraction of the seatbelt has been terminated based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor . If the protraction of the seatbelt has not been terminated the same determination is repeated whereas if it has been terminated it is determined at a step S whether the door is open or closed based upon the output signal from the door opening closing detector .

If the door is open the lapse of a predetermined time period t e.g. 1 sec as a deferment time before storing the seatbelt is waited at a step S and the count value of the counter n is reset to 0 at a step S followed by the program proceeding to the step S. On the other hand if the door is closed the lapse of a predetermined time period t e.g. 5 sec as a deferment time before storing the seatbelt is waited at a step S and then the processing proceeds to the step S. The predetermined time period t is shorter than the predetermined time period t. By virtue of this control even when the occupant protracts the seatbelt without the intention of attaching it to his body and immediately then gets off the vehicle and closes the door for example the seatbelt can be stored in its retracted position and can be prevented from being caught in the door.

As described above according to the present embodiment when it is determined that then door is open the deferment time is given before storing the seatbelt which is shorter than the deferment time applied when the door is closed steps S and S . Thus the time period from the termination of protraction of the seatbelt to the completion of retraction of the seatbelt can be made shorter when the door is open. As a result it can be prevented that the seatbelt is caught in the door.

Although in the present embodiment the deferment time is changed based upon results of the determination as to whether the door is open or closed step S alternatively the speed of retraction of the seatbelt the force of retracting the seatbelt or the time interval from the start of retraction of the seatbelt to the time of termination of the retraction may be changed depending upon the results of the above determination. In this alternative case when the door is open the speed of retraction of the seatbelt is set to a higher value the force of retracting the seatbelt is set to a larger value or the time interval from the start of retraction of the seatbelt to the time of termination of the retraction is set to a shorter value.

The electric retractor includes a danger determining device a forward distance sensor and a doze detector which are connected to the MPU but the mode selector the temperature sensor and the traveling condition detector in are omitted. The electric retractor does not have bias force imparting means as employed in the electric retractor .

The forward distance sensor detects the distance from the present automotive vehicle to an object or obstacle lying ahead of the vehicle and the doze detector detects whether the driver dozes at the wheel or drives asleep. The forward distance sensor and the doze detector are connected to the danger determining device which determines a degree of danger of the automotive vehicle.

The forward distance sensor is provided with a laser radar which is adapted to receive and emit a laser beam. is a view useful in explaining the operation of the forward distance sensor .

The laser radar has a laser emitter which emits a laser beam forwardly of the present vehicle A and a laser receiver which receives a laser beam. The laser beam emitted from the laser emitter is reflected on an obstacle e.g a vehicle B running ahead of the present vehicle A and the reflected laser beam C is received by the laser receiver of the laser radar . The forward distance sensor measures time elapsed after the emission of the laser beam to the receipt of the reflected laser beam to detect the forward distance D to the obstacle from the measured time.

Referring back to the doze detector detects an amount of change in the steering angle of the steering arm determines that there is a possibility that the driver is driving asleep if the detected amount of change in the steering angle continues to fall within a predetermined range of e.g. 8 degrees over a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec and delivers a corresponding output signal to the danger determining device .

The danger determining device calculates a time differentiated value of the forward distance D based on the detected forward distance D from the forward distance sensor determines the relative speed with respect to the obstacle from the time differentiated value and determines a time period before a possible collision by dividing the detected forward distance D by the determined relative speed. Based upon the determined time period and the output signal from the doze detector the danger determining device judges the degree of danger.

The driving of the DC motor is controlled by the PWM signal as follows 1 Provided that when the danger degree determining device judges that the degree of danger is low normal rotative driving and reverse rotative driving of the DC motor are effected at a rate of 10 times per second for example 2 Provided that when the device judges that the degree of danger is high normal rotative driving and reverse rotative driving of the DC motor are effected at a rate of 20 times per second for example. In this manner as the degree of danger increases the frequency of normal rotative driving and reverse rotative driving of the DC motor is increased so that retraction and protraction of the seatbelt are carried out more frequently to thereby enable the occupant to the sufficiently alerted to the danger.

As a variation the driving of the DC motor may be controlled by the PWM signal as follows 1 Provided that when the danger degree determining device judges that the degree of danger is low normal rotative driving of the DC motor is effected for 10 ms then reverse rotative driving of the same is effected for 10 ms and then driving of the motor is delayed for 30 ms for example 2 Provided that when the device judges that the degree of danger is high normal rotative driving of the DC motor is effected for 10 ms then reverse rotative driving of the same is effected for 10 ms then normal rotative driving of the DC motor is effected for 10 ms and then driving of the motor is delayed for 10 ms for example. In this manner as the degree of danger increases the duty ratio of normal rotative driving and reverse rotative driving of the DC motor is increased thereby changing the pattern of retraction and protraction of the seatbelt to thereby enable the occupant to be sufficiently alerted to the danger.

As another variation the driving of the DC motor may be controlled by the PWM signal as follows 1 Provided that when the danger degree determining device judges that the degree of danger is low normal rotative driving of the DC motor is effected so as to fasten the seatbelt with a force of 10 N and then reverse rotative driving of the same is effected so as to release or slacken the seatbelt with a force of 10 N for example. 2 Provided that when the device judges that the degree of danger is high normal rotative driving of the DC motor is effected so as to fasten the seatbelt with a force of 20 N and then reverse rotative driving of the same is effected so as to release the seatbelt with a force of 20 N for example. In this manner as the degree of danger is higher the fastening force and releasing force of the seatbelt by normal rotative driving and reverse rotative driving of the DC motor are increased to thereby enable the occupant to be sufficiently alerted to the danger.

As described above according to the present embodiment when the danger degree determining device judges that the degree of danger has changed from low to high i the frequency of normal rotative driving and reverse rotative driving of the DC motor is increased ii the duty ratio of normal rotative driving and reverse rotative driving of the DC motor is increased or iii the fastening force and releasing force of the seatbelt by normal rotative driving and reverse rotative driving of the DC motor are increased thereby changing the degree or manner of warning given to the occupant according to the degree of danger to thereby enable alerting the occupant to the danger sufficiently.

Although in the present embodiment the degree of danger is divided into zero low and high it may be divided into a larger number of degrees. Further although the degree of danger is determined based upon the time before collision and the possibility of doze it may be determined based upon either the time before collision or the possibility of doze.

Further when the danger degree determining device judges that the degree of danger has changed from low to high two or all of the above manners of control i to iii of the DC motor may be used in combination.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to an eighth embodiment of the invention includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor employed by the first embodiment except that the bias force imparting means is omitted and therefore illustration and description of the same are omitted.

The eighth embodiment is distinguished from the first embodiment in the contents of control executed by the MPU . The contents of control according to the eighth embodiment will be described hereinbelow.

First when attaching of the seatbelt to the occupant s body is detected retraction or winding of the seatbelt onto the reel shaft is started by the reel shaft with a constant seatbelt retraction driving force and this retraction is continued until the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit time period t . During this winding the urging force which the occupant receives from the seatbelt gradually increases while the retracting speed of the seatbelt onto the reel shaft gradually decreases.

Thereafter when the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit time point a the reel shaft is reversely rotated to start protracting the seatbelt with a constant seatbelt protracting driving force. The expression the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit means that the DC motor ceases to rotate in the seatbelt retracting direction. This protraction is to be continued until the occupant is given a predetermined amount of looseness.

In this control since when the retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft reaches its limit after the attaching of the seatbelt the reel shaft is reversely rotated to protract the seatbelt the acceleration of protraction of the seatbelt from the reel shaft suddenly increases so that the protracting motion of the seatbelt can be locked by the seatbelt locking mechanism .

To avoid this a control signal for controlling the retracting and protracting speeds of the seatbelt onto and from the reel shaft is sent from the MPU to the DC motor driver .

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected a control signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction at a predetermined rotational speed at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted so that the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases while the speed of retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft progressively decreases.

The MPU is adapted to change the duty ratio of the control signal for driving the DC motor to thereby change the rotational speed of the reel shaft .

Then the current i flowing to the DC motor is detected from current flowing through the resistance r by the current detecting circuit C at a step S. It is determined at a step S whether the detected current i exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 1.0 ampere . If the former does not exceed the latter the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter a control signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to further reduce the rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction to thereby progressively decrease the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt at a step S. On this occasion the timer measures time elapsed after the above control signal starts to be delivered to the DC motor driver .

Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec has elapsed based upon the value of the timer . If the predetermined time period has not elapsed that is the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt which is progressively decreasing has not yet fully decreased the processing returns to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period has elapsed that is the driving has fully decreased and then the seatbelt has already become fit to the occupant s body and the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit a control signal is sent from the MPU to the DC motor driver to increase the rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction at a step S to thereby control the driving force for protracting the seatbelt by the reel shaft so as to progressively increase. By this control the seatbelt is protracted so that the urging force or oppression that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively decreases and the seatbelt retracting speed of the reel shaft progressively increases. On this occasion the timer measures time elapsed after the above control signal starts to be delivered to the DC motor driver .

Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec has elapsed based upon the value of the timer . If the predetermined time period has not elapsed that is the driving force for protracting the seatbelt by the reel shaft which is progressively increasing has not yet fully increased the processing returns to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period has elapsed that is the driving force has fully increased to such a level that a predetermined amount of looseness is given to the occupant a control signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to stop the driving of the DC motor so as to stop the seatbelt protracting driving of the reel shaft at a step S followed by terminating the program

In the present embodiment as shown in when attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft is started with a constant magnitude of driving force and then the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases and the seatbelt retracting speed of the reel shaft progressively increases.

Subsequently when the current i flowing to the DC motor exceeds the predetermined value 1.0 ampere the control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to further decrease the rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction to progressively decrease the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt time period t . During this time period the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases but the rate of increase of the urging force is smaller as compared with that at the start of the retraction of the seatbelt.

Subsequently the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit time point e . Then the control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to further decrease then rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction so that the driving force for protracting the seatbelt by the reel shaft is progressively increased. When a predetermined of looseness has been given the present processing is terminated time period t . During this time period the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively decreases.

As described above according to the present embodiment when attaching of the seatbelt to the occupant has been detected retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft is started with a constant magnitude of driving force and thereafter when the current i flowing to the DC motor exceeds a predetermined value 1.0 ampere the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is controlled to progressively decrease and after the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit the driving force for protracting the seatbelt by the reel shaft is controlled to progressively increase. Therefore the disadvantage with the conventional passenger restraint and protection apparatus can be eliminated that the acceleration of protraction of the seatbelt suddenly increases and even exceeds a threshold value above which the seatbelt becomes locked during protraction. As a result the seatbelt can never be locked during protraction and therefore the occupant can be released from a state where he receives a large force of oppression providing a comfortable seatbelt attaching environment.

Although in the present embodiment the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt and the driving force of the reel shaft for protracting the seatbelt are controlled by changing the duty ratio of the control signal for driving the DC motor alternatively these driving forces may be controlled by changing the voltage of the battery Vb or by providing a variable resistor between the battery Vb and the DC motor and controlling the magnitude of current i flowing to the DC motor by changing the value of the variable resistor.

The ninth embodiment is distinguished from the eighth embodiment described above mainly in the contents of the seatbelt attaching control executed by the MPU according to the present embodiment in attaching the seatbelt to the occupant.

The present embodiment includes an electric retractor which is distinguished from the electric retractor of the first embodiment only in that a DC motor driver is employed in place of the DC motor driver .

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if it has been detected a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction at a predetermined rotational speed is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted so that the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases and the seatbelt retracting speed of the reel shaft progressively decreases.

Then an amount of current i flowing to the DC motor is detected by the current detecting circuit C from the value of current flowing through the resistance r at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the detected current i exceeds a predetermined amount e.g. 1.0 ampere . If the former does not exceed the latter the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter a control signal commanding to further decrease the rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seat retracting direction is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to thereby cause the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt to progressively decrease at a step S. On this occasion the timer measures time elapsed after the control signal starts to be delivered to the DC motor driver .

Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec has elapsed. If it has not elapsed that is the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt which is progressively decreasing has not yet fully decreased the processing returns to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period has elapsed that is the driving has fully decreased and then the seatbelt has already become fit to the occupant s body and the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit a control signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to stop the driving of the DC motor so as to stop the seatbelt retracting driving of the reel shaft at a step S followed by terminating the program.

In the present embodiment as shown in when attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft is started with a constant magnitude of driving force and then the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases and the seatbelt retracting speed of the reel shaft progressively decreases.

Subsequently when the current i flowing to the DC motor exceeds the predetermined value 1.0 ampere the control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to further decrease the rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction to progressively decrease the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt time period t . During this time period the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases but the rate of increase of the urging force is smaller as compared with that at the start of the retraction of the seatbelt.

Subsequently the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit time point f . Then the control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to stop the driving of the DC motor . Thus the seatbelt retraction by the reel shaft is stopped and thereafter protraction of the seatbelt is effected due to a restitution force of the occupant s body and clothes urged by the seatbelt to give a predetermined amount of looseness to the occupant. Consequently the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively decreases.

As described above according to the present embodiment upon detection of attaching of the seatbelt to the occupant retraction of the seatbelt is started with a constant magnitude of seatbelt driving force by the reel shaft and thereafter when the current i flowing to the DC motor exceeds a predetermined amount e.g. 1.0 ampere the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is controlled to progressively decrease and when the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to stop the driving of the DC motor . Therefore the disadvantage with the conventional passenger restraint and protection apparatus such that the acceleration of the protraction of the seatbelt suddenly increases and even exceeds a threshold value above which the seatbelt becomes locked during protraction can be eliminated. As a result the seatbelt can never be locked during protraction and therefore the passenger can be released from a state where he receives a large force of oppression providing a comfortable seatbelt attaching environment.

Although in the present embodiment the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt and the driving force for protracting the seatbelt by the reel shaft are controlled by changing the duty ratio of the control signal for driving the DC motor alternatively these driving forces may be controlled by changing the voltage of the battery Vb or by controlling the magnitude of current i flowing to the DC motor by changing the value of a variable resistor provided between the battery Vb and the DC motor .

The tenth embodiment is distinguished from the eighth embodiment described above mainly in the contents of the seatbelt attaching control executed by the MPU in attaching the seatbelt to the occupant.

The present embodiment includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor of the first embodiment.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if it has been detected a control signal commanding to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction at a predetermined rotational speed is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted so that the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases and the seatbelt retracting speed of the reel shaft progressively decreases.

Then an amount of current i flowing to the DC motor is detected by the current detecting circuit C from the value of current flowing through the resistance r at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the detected current i exceeds a predetermined amount e.g. 3.0 amperes . If the former does not exceed the latter the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter that is the seatbelt has become fit to the occupant s body and the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit time elapsed after the current i exceeds the predetermined amount 3.0 amperes is measured by the timer at a step S. Then it is determined at a step S whether the elapsed time has reached a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec . If the former does not exceed the latter the processing returns to the step S. On this occasion the driving force for retracting the seatbelt is held at a value assumed at the start of retraction of the seatbelt and the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt has the maximum value with the retracting speed and protracting speed being both equal to zero.

When it is determined at the step S that the predetermined time period has elapsed a control signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to increase the rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting speed at a step S to protract the seatbelt with a constant magnitude of driving force. Thus the seatbelt is protracted so that the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively decreases and the seatbelt protracting speed of the reel shaft progressively increases. On this occasion the timer measures time elapsed after the control signal starts to be delivered to the DC motor driver .

Upon starting of the protraction of the seatbelt the acceleration of seatbelt protraction is constant but the acceleration applied during the retraction of the seatbelt is not then applied and accordingly the seatbelt is not locked by the seatbelt locking mechanism during protraction.

Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec has elapsed based upon the value of the timer . If it has not elapsed the same determination is repeated whereas if it has elapsed that is the occupant has been given a predetermined amount of looseness a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to stop the DC motor to thereby stop the seatbelt protraction by the reel shaft at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

In the present embodiment as shown in when attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft is started with a constant magnitude of driving force and then the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases and the seatbelt retracting speed of the reel shaft progressively decreases.

Subsequently when the current i flowing to the DC motor exceeds the predetermined value 3.0 amperes the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit time point g . Over the predetermined time period 3 sec after the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit the driving force is maintained at a value assumed at the start of retraction when the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt is the maximum with the seatbelt retracting speed and seatbelt protracting speed being both zero.

After the lapse of the predetermined time period 3 sec after the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit time point h the control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to increase the rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seatbelt protracting direction to protract the seatbelt with a constant magnitude of driving force. When a predetermined amount of looseness has been given thereafter the protraction control is terminated. After the lapse of the predetermined time period 3 sec after the retraction of the seatbelt reached its limit time point h the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively decreases.

As described above according to the present embodiment after a predetermined time period 3 sec has elapsed after the retraction of the seatbelt reached its limit and the seatbelt retracting speed and seatbelt protracting speed both become zero it is controlled such that the seatbelt is protracted with a constant magnitude of driving force. Therefore the acceleration applied during the retraction of the seatbelt is not then applied so that the acceleration of protraction of the seatbelt does not exceed a threshold value above which the seatbelt can be locked during protraction and accordingly the seatbelt is never locked by the seatbelt locking mechanism during protraction and therefore the occupant can be released from a state where he receives a large force of oppression providing a comfortable seatbelt attaching environment.

The eleventh embodiment is distinguished from the ninth embodiment described above mainly in the contents of the seatbelt attaching control executed by the MPU in attaching the seatbelt to the occupant.

The present embodiment includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor of the ninth embodiment.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction at a predetermined rotational speed at a step S. Thus the seatbelt is retracted so that the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases and the seatbelt retracting speed of the reel shaft progressively decreases.

Then an amount of current i flowing to the DC motor is detected by the current detecting circuit C from the value of current flowing through the resistance r at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the detected current i exceeds a predetermined amount e.g. 3.0 amperes . If the former does not exceed the latter the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter that is the seatbelt has become fit to the occupant s body and the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit time elapsed after the current i exceeds the predetermined amount 3.0 amperes is measured by the timer at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the elapsed time has reached a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec . If the former has not reached the latter the processing returns to the step S. On this occasion the driving force for retracting the seatbelt is held at a value assumed at the start of retraction of the seatbelt and the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt is the maximum with the retracting speed and protracting speed being both equal to zero.

When it is determined at the step S that the predetermined time period has elapsed a control signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to stop the DC motor to thereby stop the seatbelt retraction by the reel shaft at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

In the present embodiment as shown in when attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft is started with a constant magnitude of driving force and then the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases and the seatbelt retracting speed of the reel shaft progressively decreases.

Subsequently when the current i flowing to the DC motor exceeds the predetermined value 3.0 amperes the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit time point j . Over 3 seconds after the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit the driving force is maintained at a value assumed at the start of retraction when the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt is the maximum with the seatbelt retracting speed and seatbelt protracting speed being both zero.

After the lapse of the predetermined time period 3 sec after the retraction of the seatbelt reaches its limit time point k the control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to stop the driving by the DC motor . Thus the retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft is stopped and thereafter protraction of the seatbelt is effected due to a restitution force of the occupant s body and clothes urged by the seatbelt to give a predetermined amount of looseness to the occupant. Consequently the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively decreases.

As described above according to the present embodiment after a predetermined time period 3 seconds has elapsed after the retraction of the seatbelt reached its limit and the seatbelt retracting speed and seatbelt protracting speed both become zero a control signal commanding to stop the driving of the DC motor is delivered to the DC motor driver . Therefore the acceleration applied during the retraction of the seatbelt is not then applied so that the acceleration of protraction of the seatbelt is given only by the restitution force of the occupant s body and clothes urged by the seatbelt and hence does not exceed a threshold value above which the seatbelt can be locked during protraction and accordingly the seatbelt is never locked by the seatbelt locking mechanism during protraction and therefore the occupant can be released from a state where he receives a large force of oppression providing a comfortable seatbelt attaching environment.

The present embodiment includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor of the eighth embodiment.

In the present embodiment as shown in when release of the seatbelt is detected retraction of the seatbelt is started with a constant magnitude of driving force by the reel shaft . The MPU determines whether the retraction of the seatbelt is just about to be terminated time point n based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor .

If the retraction of the seatbelt is just about to be terminated time point n a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to decrease the rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction so as to progressively decrease the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt. On this occasion the timer measures time elapsed after the start of delivery of the control signal to the DC motor driver .

Then it is determined whether the elapsed time has reached a predetermined time period e.g. 1.5 sec . If the former has not reached the latter the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt which is progressively decreasing has not fully decreased the measurement of the elapsed time is continued whereas if the predetermined time period has elapsed that is the driving force has fully decreased time point o a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to stop the driving of the DC motor followed by terminating the present processing. Thus the retraction of the seatbelt is terminated.

As described above according to the present embodiment immediately before the termination of retraction of the seatbelt the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is controlled so as to progressively decrease. As a result a so called end locking phenomenon can be prevented that the speed of retraction of the seatbelt suddenly becomes zero upon termination of retraction of the seatbelt causing locking of the seatbelt during subsequent protraction. Therefore the seatbelt can never be locked during protraction.

The thirteenth embodiment of the invention is distinguished from the above described fifth embodiment in the seatbelt slackening control.

The present embodiment has an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor of the fifth embodiment description of which is therefore omitted.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected it is determined at a step S whether slackening of the seatbelt is needed. The slackening of the seatbelt is needed when the seatbelt has been deviated from a proper position for example if i the vehicle is braked while traveling at a predetermined speed or a higher speed and then the vehicle speed drops below a predetermined speed or the vehicle stops to be braked ii the collision predictor once predicts that there is a fear of collision and subsequently predicts that there is no fear of collision or iii the seatbelt is protracted by the occupant and subsequently the seatbelt comes into a retractable state.

If it is determined at the step S that the slackening of the seatbelt is not needed the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if it is determined that the slackening is needed a PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit based upon the current flowing to the DC motor . Thus an improper amount of looseness of the seatbelt is once completely removed.

If it is determined at the step S that the retraction of the seatbelt has not reached its limit the processing returns to the step S whereas if it is determined that the retraction has reached its limit a PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction at a step S followed by determining at a step S whether the seatbelt has been locked by the seatbelt locking mechanism during protraction. More specifically if an amount of fluctuation in the terminal voltage across the DC motor is below a predetermined value during rotation of the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction it is determined that the seatbelt has been locked during protraction. Alternatively if the current flowing to the DC motor exceeds a predetermined current amount or an amount of fluctuation in the same is below a predetermined value it may be determined that the seatbelt has been locked during protraction.

If it is determined at the step S that the seatbelt has been locked during protraction in order to release the locked state and then give a predetermined looseness to the seatbelt again the processing returns to the step S. The driving force employed for the retraction of the seatbelt executed by the step S at this time is set to a larger value than the driving force employed when it is determined that slackening of the seatbelt is needed at the step S in order to release the seatbelt from its locked state.

The seatbelt can be locked during protraction for example when the seatbelt is retracted with an increased retracting force in response to a determination that there is a fear of collision of the vehicle and subsequently it is determined that the fear of collision has disappeared to carry out a slackening operation i.e. slackening of the seatbelt is determined to be needed the increased retracting force is reduced to a smaller value so that the restitution force of the occupant s body or the like causes a slight protraction of the seatbelt which in turn causes locking of the seatbelt. In such a case if the seatbelt is retracted with the above mentioned increased retracting force larger than the one before the locking of the seatbelt the locking of the seatbelt can be released enabling execution of the slackening operation again.

If it is determined at the step S that the seatbelt has not been locked during protraction it is determined at a step S whether the amount of protraction of the seatbelt has reached a first predetermined amount e.g. 10 cm based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor .

If the protraction amount has not reached the first predetermined amount the processing returns to the step S to continue the protraction of the seatbelt whereas if the former has reached the latter the PWM signal is again delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver to cause rotation of the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction for caution s sake at a step S in case that locking of the seatbelt during protraction has not been properly detected.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the amount of retraction of the seatbelt has reached a second predetermined amount e.g. 5 cm based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor . If the former has not reached the latter the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former has reached the latter the present processing is terminated.

As described above according to the present embodiment when slackening of the seatbelt is needed the answer is YES at the step S the seatbelt is retracted to its limit the answer is YES at the step S and then to give a predetermined amount of looseness the seatbelt is protracted step S and if during the protraction the seatbelt is locked the answer is YES at the step S the seatbelt is retracted to release the locking and give a predetermined of looseness again step S and if the seatbelt is not locked during the protraction after the amount of protraction of the seatbelt reaches a first predetermined amount the seatbelt is retracted by a second predetermined amount steps S and S . Thus the present embodiment is constructed such that the occupant can be given a predetermined amount of looseness without fail and unnecessary locking of the seatbelt is released. As a result the present embodiment can provide a comfortable seatbelt attaching environment and properly protect the occupant.

The electric retractor includes a DC DC converter an auxiliary power supply a reverse current blocking device and a vehicle power supply installed in the automotive vehicle which are connected to the MPU but the mode selector the temperature sensor and the traveling condition detector in are omitted. Further the electric retractor does not have bias force imparting means as employed in the electric retractor .

Connected to the DC motor driver are the vehicle power supply which is formed e.g. of a battery for supplying supply power required for driving the DC motor and the reverse current blocking device which is formed e.g. of a diode.

The auxiliary power supply which is formed e.g. of a capacitor is connected to the reverse current blocking device and also connected to the MPU via the DC DC converter . The reverse current blocking device serves to prevent energy stored in the auxiliary power supply from flowing to the vehicle power supply or to the DC motor driver and permits the energy to be supplied to the MPU via the DC DC converter . The auxiliary power supply stores energy supplied from the vehicle power supply and supplies the energy over a predetermined time period after stoppage of supply of the energy from the vehicle power supply . For example in the event of a collision of the vehicle the auxiliary power supply supplies energy stored therein to the MPU over 100 ms for example after the collision. The DC DC converter converts output voltage from the vehicle power supply to a voltage value suitable for operation of the MPU e.g. 5 volts.

The MPU includes a RAM and an EEPROM non volatile ROM for storing a bit string indicative of a kind of control of the electric retractor and a ROM . The MPU determines whether the seatbelt has been protracted based upon the sign of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and determines whether retraction of the seatbelt has been terminated based upon the current i flowing to the DC motor .

Except for those described above the electric retractor is identical in construction with the electric retractor of the first embodiment description of which is therefore omitted.

Next description will be made of a summary of operation of the electric retractor as well as details of the bit string indicative of the kind of control of the electric retractor and the terminal voltage across the DC motor .

When the seatbelt is protracted a potential difference is generated between the terminals of the DC motor which corresponds to the protracting speed. The seatbelt locking mechanism has a WSI Webbing Sensitive Inertia function which locks the seatbelt during protraction when the acceleration of protraction of the seatbelt exceeds a predetermined value. The seatbelt locking mechanism has a VSI Vehicle Sensitive Inertia function which locks the seatbelt during protraction when acceleration applied to the vehicle exceeds a predetermined value. The seatbelt locking mechanism locks the seatbelt only after the reel shaft has rotated in the seatbelt protracting direction by a predetermined amount. On this occasion the terminal voltage across the DC motor rises along a gradient corresponding to the seatbelt protracting speed and suddenly drops immediately such that the seatbelt is locked during protraction as shown in . The MPU grasps a waveform of the terminal voltage across the DC motor as shown in and stores a value of the terminal voltage assumed from a time point 100 ms before the seatbelt is locked during protraction to a time point 100 ms after the seatbelt is locked during protraction in the EEPROM via the RAM together with the kind of control of the electric retractor .

The kind of control of the electric retractor includes a seatbelt attaching assisting control which is triggered when protraction of the seatbelt by the occupant in attaching the seatbelt to his body is detected to control the DC motor so as to facilitate protraction of the seatbelt a seatbelt oppression removing control which is triggered when the seatbelt tongue is attached to the buckle to control the DC motor to retract the seatbelt and then control the DC motor so as to give a predetermined amount of looseness to the occupant after the seatbelt has become fit to the occupant s body and the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit a movement control which is triggered when the occupant has moved to slightly protract after attaching the seatbelt onto his body to control the DC motor so as to facilitate the protraction of the seatbelt and a seatbelt storing control which is triggered when the seatbelt has been protracted but not attached to the occupant or when the seatbelt tongue has been disconnected from the buckle to control the DC motor so as to store the seatbelt in the retracted position.

The terminal voltage and control kind area has areas for storing an address counter values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor respectively each area consisting of 200 rows as shown in . The contents stored in the areas are transferred to the EEPROM and stored therein.

The area for storing the kind of control of the electric retractor is formed of a bit string of 4 bits as shown in . When the least significant bit b assumes 1 that is the bit string is 0001 it indicates the seatbelt attaching auxiliary control when the bit b assumes 1 that is the bit string is 0010 it indicates the seatbelt oppression removing control and when the bit b assumes 1 that is the bit string is 0100 it indicates the movement control and when the most significant bit b assume that is the bit string is 1000 it indicates the seatbelt storing control.

First values in the terminal voltage and control kind area of the RAM are cleared at a step S and it is determined at a step S whether the seatbelt has been protracted. If the seatbelt has not been protracted the same determination is repeated whereas if the seatbelt has been protracted time interrupt processing hereinafter described with reference to is rendered effective at a step S.

Then the bit string of 0001 is set into the control kind area at a step S followed by executing the seatbelt attaching assisting control at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the bit string of 1000 is set into the control kind area at a step S followed by executing the seatbelt storing control at a step S and rendering the timer interrupt processing ineffective at a step S and then the processing returns to the step S.

On the other hand if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected the bit string of 0010 is set into the control kind area at a step S followed by executing the seatbelt oppression removing control at a step S.

Thereafter it is determined at a step S whether the seatbelt has been protracted. If the seatbelt has been protracted the bit string of 0100 is set into the control kind area at a step S and followed by executing the movement control at a step S and then the processing returns to the step S whereas if the seatbelt has not been protracted it is determined at a step S whether disconnection of the seatbelt tongue from the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector .

If disconnection of the seatbelt has been detected the processing proceeds to the step S whereas if disconnection of the seatbelt has not been detected the processing proceeds to the step S.

First the MPU temporarily saves the status of working of the control being executed in the save area of the RAM at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the seatbelt has been locked during protraction by the seatbelt locking mechanism based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor . If the seatbelt has not been locked during protraction that is there is no accident of the vehicle the voltage measuring circuit C is actuated to measure the terminal voltage across the DC motor at a step S and an address is read out from the RAM at a step S. In this case an address FF00 is read out from the RAM .

Then a value of the terminal voltage across the DC motor measured at the step S and the kind of control of the electric retractor previously set by the main control are stored in the terminal voltage and control kind area at the readout address location of FF00 at a step S. In the example of in this case the terminal voltage is 0.5 volts and the kind of control is 0001 i.e. the seatbelt attaching assisting control.

After the storing at the step S the address is incremented by 1 at a step S. In the example the address is shifted from FF00 to FF01 .

Then it is determined at a step S whether the address is larger than a predetermined address FF99 for example. If the former is larger than the latter for example if the address is FF100 the first address FF00 is read out and set at a step S to store the address FF00 in the RAM at a step S. On the other hand if the address is not larger than the address FF99 for example if the address is FF10 the address FF10 is stored in the RAM at the step S. Then the working status of the control temporarily saved at the step S is read out or restored at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

If it is determined at the step S that the seatbelt has been locked during protraction that is the vehicle has encountered an accident the terminal voltage across the DC motor is measured by the voltage measuring circuit C at a step S and the measured terminal voltage value and the kind of control of the electric retractor are stored in the terminal voltage and control kind area of the RAM at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 100 ms has elapsed after the seatbelt was locked during protraction. If the predetermined time period has not elapsed a time adjustment is carried out so as to store the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor at time intervals of 1 ms for example at a step S followed by the processing returning to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period has elapsed values of the terminal voltage and the kind of control obtained over a predetermined time period before and after the seatbelt was locked during protraction e.g. over 100 ms as well as the address just before the locking of the seatbelt e.g. FF60 are transferred to the EEPROM and stored therein at a step S. Then the working status of the control temporarily saved at the step S is restored at the step S followed by terminating the present processing.

The reason why the address just before the locking of the seatbelt is transferred to the EEPROM at the step S is that it is possible to accurately read out from the address just before the locking of the seatbelt the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor over a predetermined time period e.g. over 100 ms. For example if the address FF60 is the address just before the locking of the seatbelt the contents of the RAM at addresses from FF60 to FF00 and from FF99 to FF61 are read out from the RAM so that the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor over the predetermined time period i.e. 100 ms can be accurately read out.

As described above according to the present embodiment values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor over a predetermined time period before and after locking of the seatbelt during protraction are transferred to the EEPROM and stored therein step S . As a result the contents of the RAM can be accurately read out after an accident to thereby enable accurate determination of the operative state of the automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus and the occupant state in the event of a collision of the vehicle or a like accident.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a fifteenth embodiment of the invention is distinguished from the above described fourteenth embodiment in the range of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor to be stored in the EEPROM . More specifically while in the fourteenth embodiment values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor obtained over a predetermined time period before and after locking of the seatbelt during protraction e.g. 100 ms are stored in the EEPROM in the fifteenth embodiment values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor obtained after a signal indicative of a collision being unavoidable is received from the MPU and until a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec elapses thereafter are stored in the EEPROM .

The electric retractor includes a distance sensor and an MPU which constitute a traveling condition detector . Except for this the electric retractor is identical in construction with the electric retractor .

Next description will be made of a summary of the operation of the electric retractor as well as details of a bit string indicative of the kind of control of the electric retractor and the terminal voltage across the DC motor .

When the signal indicative of unavoidableness of a collision is received from the MPU the MPU grasps a waveform of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and stores values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor obtained over a predetermined time period after receipt of the control signal for example over a time period until 3 seconds elapse after receipt of the signal in the EEPROM via the RAM .

The kind of control of the electric retractor includes controls similar to those of the fourteenth embodiment i.e. the seatbelt attaching assisting control the seatbelt oppression removing control the movement control and the seatbelt storing control.

A main control executed by the MPU according to the present embodiment is similar to or identical with the main control of employed by the fourteenth embodiment description of which is therefore omitted.

First the MPU temporarily saves the status of working of the control being executed in the save area of the RAM at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the signal indicative of unavoidableness of a collision has been received from the MPU . If the signal has not been received the status of working of control temporarily saved at the step S is restored at a step S followed by terminating the present processing. On the other hand if the signal has been received the voltage measuring circuit C is actuated to measure the terminal voltage across the DC motor at a step S and the measured terminal voltage value and the kind of control of the electric retractor are stored in the terminal voltage and control kind area of the RAM at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec has elapsed after receipt of the signal from the MPU based upon the value of the timer . If the predetermined time period has not elapsed a time adjustment is carried out so as to store the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor at time intervals of 10 ms at a step S followed by returning to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period has elapsed values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor as well the kind of control of the electric retractor obtained after the receipt of the signal indicative of collision unavoidableness and until a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec elapses thereafter are transferred to the EEPROM and stored therein at a step S. Then the working status of control temporarily saved at the step S is restored at the step S followed by terminating the present processing.

As described above according to the present embodiment values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor being executed obtained before a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec elapses after receipt of a signal indicative of collision unavoidableness from the MPU are transferred to and stored in the EEPROM step S . As a result the contents of the EEPROM can be accurately read out after an accident to thereby enable accurate determination of the operative state of the automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus and the occupant state in the event of a collision of the vehicle or a like accident.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a sixteenth embodiment of the invention is distinguished from the above described fifteenth embodiment in the range of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor to be stored in the EEPROM . More specifically while in the fifteenth embodiment values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor obtained after a signal indicative of a collision being unavoidable is received from the MPU and until a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec elapses thereafter are stored in the EEPROM in the sixteenth embodiment values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor obtained over a predetermined time period e.g. 100 ms before and after a signal indicative of a collision being unavoidable is received from a collision sensor hereinafter referred to are stored in the EEPROM .

A main control executed by the MPU according to the present embodiment is similar to or identical with the main control of employed by the fourteenth embodiment description of which is therefore omitted.

First the MPU temporarily saves the status of working of the control being executed in the save area of the RAM at a step S.

Then the MPU determines whether the signal indicative of collision unavoidableness has been received from the collision sensor at a step SA. If the signal indicative of collision unavoidableness has not been received the processing proceeds to a step S. The steps S to S are identical with the steps S to S in and therefore description of them is omitted.

If it is determined at the step SA that the signal indicative of collision unavoidableness has been received from the collision sensor that is if the vehicle has encountered a collision the processing proceeds to a step S. The step S to a step S are identical with the steps S to S in and therefore description of them is omitted.

As described above according to the present embodiment values of the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the kind of control of the electric retractor being executed obtained over a predetermined time period e.g. 100 ms before and after receipt of a signal indicative of collision unavoidableness from the collision sensor are transferred to and stored in the EEPROM step S . As a result the contents of the EEPROM can be accurately read out after an accident to thereby enable accurate determination of the operative state of the automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus and the occupant state in the event of a collision of the vehicle or a like accident for use of the same in investigating the cause of the accident.

Although in the above described fourteenth to sixteenth embodiments the terminal voltage across the DC motor is stored in the EEPROM current flowing to the DC motor may be stored in the EEPROM or a like memory providing substantially the same results.

The electric retractor includes an airbag and pretensioner controller an airbag and a pretensioner and gas generators and but the mode selector the temperature sensor and the traveling condition detector in are omitted. The electric retractor does not have bias force imparting means as employed in the electric retractor .

In the electric retractor the airbag and pretensioner controller which controls the airbag and the pretensioner is connected to the MPU and the airbag and the pretensioner which operate to prevent the occupant from colliding against equipment within the vehicle compartment upon a collision of the vehicle are connected to the airbag and pretensioner controller .

The airbag has a plurality of gas generators . The pretensioner rapidly winds up the seatbelt to protect the occupant upon a collision of the vehicle and has a plurality of gas generators . The pretensioner is coupled to the central shaft of the reel shaft via the reel shaft pulley .

When gas generated from the gas generators is introduced into the gas chamber the pressure within the gas chamber rises to urgingly move the rack downward as viewed in . This causes the pinion to rotate in unison with the movement of the rack to cause the reel shaft coupled to the pinion to rotate in the seatbelt retracting direction whereby the seatbelt is rapidly retracted upon a collision of the vehicle.

Referring again to the airbag and pretensioner controller receives a pressure control signal and a timing control signal from the MPU and in response to these control signals sets and changes the actuation time and expansion pressure of the airbag or the actuation time of the pretensioner and the force of the pretensioner for retracting the seatbelt.

Except for those described above the electric retractor is identical in construction with the electric retractor description of which is therefore omitted.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected it is determined at a step S whether the seatbelt has been protracted.

If it is determined at the step S that the seatbelt has not been protracted the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if the seatbelt has been protracted the rotational speed of the reel shaft is detected at a step S. The rotational speed of the reel shaft is proportional to the terminal voltage across the DC motor with its terminals open and therefore the rotational speed of the reel shaft is detected based upon the terminal voltage across the DC motor .

Then it is determined at a step S whether the detected rotational speed of the reel shaft is higher than a predetermined value e.g. 5 revolutions per sec . If the former is not higher than the latter it means that the occupant has moved after attaching the seatbelt onto his body and therefore the present processing is immediately terminated. On the other hand if the reel shaft speed is higher than the predetermined value it means that the vehicle has collided a correction value T for the actuation times of the the airbag and the pretensioner is calculated by the use of the following formula 5 and a correction value P for the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner by the use of the following formula 6 at a step S. The timer starts measuring time elapsed after the collision of the vehicle 2 11 1 5 where K1 and K2 represent a first coefficient and a second coefficient respectively K1 0 and K2 0 and v represents the rotational speed of the reel shaft . 2 1 1 1 0.6 where a1 and a2 represent a first coefficient and a second coefficient respectively a1 0 and a2 0 .

Signals indicative of the correction values T P calculated as above are delivered to the airbag and pretensioner controller at a step S.

According to the above formulas 5 and 6 in the event of a strong collision of the vehicle the reel shaft rotational speed v is high so that the calculated correction value T of the actuation times of the airbag and the pretensioner is large long and also the calculated correction value P of the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner is large. On the other hand in the event of a weak collision of the vehicle the reel shaft rotational speed v is low so that the calculated correction value T of the actuation times of the airbag and the pretensioner is small short and also the calculated correction value P of the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner is small.

Then the airbag and pretentioner controller calculates a desired value T of the actuation times of the airbag and the pretensioner by the use of the following formula 7 and actuates the gas generators and of the airbag and the pretensioner based upon the calculated desired actuation time value T.

Further the airbag and pretensioner controller calculates a desired value P of the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner and actuates the gas generators and of the airbag and the pretensioner based upon the calculated desired value P 7 where T represents a predetermined value of the actuation times of the airbag and the pretensioner . 8 where P represents a predetermined value of the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner .

According to the above formula 7 in the event of a strong collision of the vehicle the calculated correction value T of the actuation times of the airbag and the pretensioner is long from the above formula 5 and accordingly the calculated actuation time T of the airbag and the pretensioner is short. Therefore the airbag and pretensioner controller sets the igniting timing of the gas generators and to advanced timing. By thus controlling even in the case where the protracting speed of the seatbelt is so high that the occupant is very likely to collide against equipment within the vehicle compartment the airbag and the pretensioner are quickly actuated to properly protect the occupant. On the other hand in the event of a weak collision of the vehicle the calculated correction value T of the actuation times of the airbag and the pretensioner is short from the above formula 5 and accordingly the calculated actuation time T of the airbag and the pretensioner is long. Therefore the airbag and pretensioner controller sets the igniting timing of the gas generators and to relatively retarded timing. By thus controlling in the event of a weak collision of the vehicle the igniting timing of the gas generators can be set to a retarded value than in the conventional apparatus to thereby give an appropriate amount of impact to the occupant and hence properly protect the occupant in the event of a collision of the vehicle.

According to the above formula 8 in the event of a strong collision of the vehicle the calculated correction value P of the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner is large from the above formula 6 and accordingly the calculated desired value P of the expansion pressure and seatbelt retracting force is small. Therefore the airbag and pretensioner controller actuates only one gas generator if two gas generators are actuated in the event of a collision of the vehicle in the conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus so as to decrease the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner to a smaller value than in the conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus whereby impact applied to the occupant is reduced. On the other hand in the event of a weak collision of the vehicle the calculated correction value P of the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner is small from the above formula 6 and accordingly the calculated desired value P of the expansion pressure and seatbelt retracting force is large. Therefore the airbag and pretensioner controller actuates three gas generators so as to increase the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner to a larger value than in the conventional automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus. By thus controlling in the event of a weak collision of the vehicle the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner can be set to a larger value than in the conventional apparatus to thereby give an appropriate magnitude of pressure and force to the occupant and hence properly protect the occupant in the event of a collision of the vehicle.

By virtue of the control according to the steps S and S and the formulas 5 to 8 even in the event that the protracting speed of the seatbelt is so high that the occupant is very likely to collide against equipment within the vehicle compartment the airbag and the pretensioner quickly operate to properly protect the occupant upon a collision of the vehicle. Further the desired value P of the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner can be set to a smaller value than in the conventional apparatus to thereby reduce impact applied to the occupant and hence properly protect the occupant upon a collision of the vehicle.

Further when the protracting speed of the seatbelt is low the igniting timing of the gas generators can be set to a retarded value than in the conventional apparatus to thereby give an appropriate amount of impact to the occupant and the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner can be set to a larger value than in the conventional apparatus to thereby reduce impact applied to the occupant and hence properly protect the occupant upon a collision of the vehicle.

After execution of the step S a correction value F of the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is calculated by the use of the following formula 9 at a step S 2 1 1 9 where b1 and b2 represent a first coefficient and a second coefficient respectively b1 0 and b2 0 .

According to the above formula 9 in the event of a strong collision of the vehicle the rotational speed v of the reel shaft is high and accordingly the calculated correction value F of the driving force of the reel shaft is small and on the other hand in the event of a weak collision of the vehicle the rotational speed v of the reel shaft is low and accordingly the calculated correction value F is large.

Then a desired driving force F of the reel shaft is calculated from the calculated correction value F by the use of the following formula 10 and the airbag and pretensioner controller drives the reel shaft based upon the calculated driving force F at a step S 10 where F represent a predetermined value of the driving force of the reel shaft .

To drive the reel shaft with the driving force F the MPU sets the duty ratio of a control signal to be delivered to the DC motor driver to set the terminal voltage across the DC motor .

According to the above formula 10 in the event of a strong collision of the vehicle the calculated correction value F of the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is small from the above formula 9 and accordingly the calculated desired driving force F of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is large. Therefore the EA function a function of causing the reel shaft to rotate in the direction of protracting the seatbelt when a tension in excess of a prescribed value is applied to the seatbelt immediately after a collision of the automotive vehicle so as to control the tension to or below the prescribed value which causes the reel shaft to rotate in the direction of protracting the seatbelt when a tension in excess of a prescribed value is applied to the seatbelt immediately after a collision of the automotive vehicle can operate to protract the seatbelt without being terminated halfway i.e. at a time point when it is desired that the same function should be still exhibited since a substantial tension applied to the seatbelt is reduced by the large driving force F of the reel shaft . Thus the EA function can effectively absorb impact applied to the occupant to thereby properly protect the occupant in the event of a strong collision of the vehicle. On the other hand in the event of a weak collision of the vehicle the calculated correction value F of the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is large from the above formula 9 and accordingly the calculated desired driving force F of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is small. Therefore the EA function can operate to protract the seatbelt without fail since a substantial tension applied to the seatbelt is increased by the small driving force of the reel shaft . Thus the EA function can effectively absorb impact applied to the occupant to thereby properly protect the occupant in the event of a weak collision of the vehicle.

Next it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 2 sec has elapsed after the collision based upon the value of the timer . If the predetermined time period has not elapsed the same determination is repeated whereas if the predetermined time period has elapsed the driving of the reel shaft is stopped at a step S followed by terminating the present processing. To stop the driving of the reel shaft the MPU delivers a control signal commanding to stop the driving of the DC motor to the DC motor driver .

As described above according to the present embodiment the desired value. T of the actuation times of the airbag and the pretensioner and the desired value P of the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner are variably set according to the terminal voltage across the DC motor and the rotational speed v of the reel shaft steps S and S and formulas 5 to 8 . As a result even when the protracting speed of the seatbelt is so high that the occupant is very likely to collide again equipment within the vehicle compartment as in the event of a strong collision of the vehicle the airbag and the pretensioner can be quickly actuated and further the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner are set to a smaller value to thereby reduce impact applied to the occupant and hence properly protect the occupant in the event of a collision of the vehicle.

Further when the retracting speed of the seatbelt is low as in the event of a weak collision of the vehicle the igniting timing of the gas generators can be set to a retarded value than in the conventional apparatus to thereby give an appropriate amount of impact to the occupant and further the expansion pressure of the airbag and the seatbelt retracting force of the pretensioner can be set to a larger value than in the conventional apparatus to thereby reduce impact applied to the occupant and hence properly protect the occupant upon a collision of the vehicle.

Furthermore the driving force F of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt can be variably set according to the terminal voltage across the DC motor or the rotational speed v of the reel shaft steps S and S and formulas 9 and 10 . As a result impact applied to the occupant can be effectively absorbed to thereby properly protect the occupant in the event of a collision of the vehicle.

Although in the present embodiment the rotational speed v of the reel shaft is detected from the terminal voltage of the DC motor with its terminals open this is not limitative but alternatively the rotational speed v of the reel shaft may be detected by a rotational speed sensor which may be provided on the central shaft of the reel shaft .

Further although in the present embodiment the is rotational speed v of the reel shaft is used for the above described control alternatively a retracting speed sensor may be provided at an outlet port for the seatbelt to thereby directly detect the protracting speed of the seatbelt providing substantially the same results.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to an eighteenth embodiment of the invention includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor except that the bias force imparting means is omitted description of which is therefore omitted.

A summary of control processing fault diagnosis executed by the MPU according to the present embodiment will be first described below.

The fault diagnosis according to the present embodiment is carried out by the following two methods a and b which are executed independently of each other and when it is determined by either one of the methods that there is a fault it is judged that the seatbelt locking mechanism is faulty 

 a When no fault in the seatbelt locking mechanism is detected it is checked whether the seatbelt locking mechanism functions normally while the reel shaft is given a rotational speed in the seatbelt protracting direction at which the seatbelt can be locked during protraction and if the mechanism does not function normally it is determined that there is a fault.

 b When no fault in the seatbelt locking mechanism is detected it is checked whether the seatbelt locking mechanism does not function while the reel shaft is given a rotational speed in the seatbelt protracting direction at which the seatbelt cannot be locked during protraction and if the mechanism functions it is determined that there is a fault.

Details of the control processing will now be described with reference to . is a flowchart showing a fault diagnostic program executed by the MPU which corresponds to the method a .

First to quickly protract the seatbelt in attaching the seatbelt to the occupant s body a control signal commands rotation of the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction at a high speed i.e. a control signal having a duty ratio required for such a high speed rotation is delivered to the DC motor driver at a step S. Responsive to this control signal the DC motor driver rotates the DC motor at a high rotational speed in the seatbelt protracting direction. The reel shaft then rotates in the seatbelt protracting direction at a high speed in unison with the rotation of the DC motor . If the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal it locks the reel shaft to stop when the latter rotates at the above high speed.

Then the current i flowing to the DC motor is detected based upon current flowing through the resistance r by the current detecting circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S. It is determined at a step S whether the detected current i exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 5 amperes .

If the detected current i exceeds the predetermined value that is the DC motor continues to be energized for rotation with the reel shaft in the locked state it is determined at a step S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is functioning normally followed by terminating the present processing.

On the other hand if the detected current i is below the predetermined value that is the DC motor continues to be energized for rotation with the reel shaft not properly locked it is determined at a step S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is functioning abnormally and then a warning is given to the occupant by means of a display device or a warning light not shown to warn him of the abnormality of the seatbelt locking mechanism at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

First to slowly protract the seatbelt to give a predetermined amount of looseness to the seatbelt after the seatbelt is attached to the occupant and made fit to his body a control signal commands rotation of the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction at a low speed i.e. a control signal having a duty ratio required for such a low speed rotation is delivered to the DC motor driver at a step S. Responsive to this control signal the DC motor driver rotates the DC motor at a low speed in the seatbelt protracting direction. The reel shaft then rotates in the seatbelt protracting direction at a low speed in unison with the rotation of the DC motor . If the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal it does not lock the reel shaft when the latter rotates at the above low speed.

Then the current i flowing to the DC motor is detected based upon current flowing through the resistance r by the current detecting circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S. It is determined at a step S whether the detected current i is below a predetermined value e.g. 3 amperes .

If the detected current i is below the predetermined value that is the DC motor continues to be energized for rotation with the reel shaft in the unlocked state it is determined at a step S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is functioning normally followed by terminating the present processing.

On the other hand if the detected current i exceeds the predetermined value that is the DC motor continues to be energized for rotation with the reel shaft in the locked state it is determined at a step S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is functioning abnormally and then a warning is given to the occupant by means of the display device or the warning light to warn him of the abnormality of the seatbelt locking mechanism at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

In the present control processing fault diagnosis only when it is determined at both of the steps S and S in that the seatbelt locking mechanism is functioning normally it is finally determined that the same mechanism is normal while when it is determined at either the step S in or the step S in that the seatbelt locking mechanism is functioning abnormally it is immediately finally determined that the same mechanism is abnormal. Alternatively only when it is determined at both of the steps S and S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is abnormal it may be finally determined that the same mechanism is abnormal to avoid frequent warning due to noise or the like.

As described above according to the present embodiment a control signal commanding to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction at a high speed is delivered to the DC motor driver and based upon results of a determination as to whether current then flowing to the DC motor exceeds a predetermined value it is determined that the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal or abnormal. Further a control signal commanding to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction at a low speed is delivered to the DC motor driver and based upon results of a determination as to whether current then flowing to the DC motor is below a predetermined value it is determined that the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal or abnormal. Further the abnormality of the seatbelt locking mechanism is finally determined based upon the above two determinations. As a result fault diagnosis of the seatbelt locking mechanism can be accurately achieved.

Further since the results of the determinations steps S and S are notified via the display device or warning light steps S and S it is possible to examine the cause of the fault and quickly take measures to repair the seatbelt locking mechanism.

Although in the present embodiment fault diagnosis is made based upon results of the two kinds of determinations a plurality of kinds of control signals commanding different high rotational speeds for example and or a plurality of kinds of control signals commanding different low rotational speeds for example may be delivered to the DC motor driver to carry out fault diagnosis based upon more than two kinds of determinations.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a nineteenth embodiment of the invention includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor of the above described eighteenth embodiment description of which is therefore omitted. The present embodiment is distinguished from the eighteenth embodiment in the manner of fault diagnosis.

A summary of control processing fault diagnosis executed by the MPU according to the present embodiment will be first described below.

The fault diagnosis according to the present embodiment is carried out by the following two methods c and d which are executed independently of each other and when it is determined by either one of the methods that there is a fault it is judged that the seatbelt locking mechanism is faulty 

 c When no fault in the seatbelt locking mechanism is detected it is checked whether the seatbelt locking mechanism functions normally while the reel shaft is given a rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction at which the seatbelt can be locked during protraction and if the mechanism does not function normally it is determined that there is a fault.

 d When no fault in the seatbelt locking mechanism is detected it is checked whether the seatbelt locking mechanism does not function while the reel shaft is given a rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction at which the seatbelt cannot be locked during protraction and if the mechanism functions it is determined that there is a fault.

Details of the control processing will now be described with reference to . is a flowchart showing a fault diagnostic program executed by the MPU which corresponds to the method c .

First to quickly protract the seatbelt in attaching the seatbelt on the occupant s body a control signal commands rotation of the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction at a high rotational speed i.e. a control signal commanding a change from a low degree of rotational acceleration to a desired high degree of rotational acceleration is delivered to the DC motor driver at a step S. More specifically the MPU gradually increases the duty ratio of the control signal and responsive to this control signal the DC motor driver changes the rotational acceleration of the DC motor from a low degree of rotational acceleration to a high degree of rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction. The reel shaft then gradually increases in rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction in unison with the rotational acceleration of the DC motor . If the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal it locks the reel shaft when the rotational acceleration of the reel shaft changes from the low degree of rotational acceleration to the desired high degree of rotational acceleration.

Then the current i flowing to the DC motor is detected based upon current flowing through the resistance r by the current detecting circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S. It is determined at a step S whether the detected current i exceeds a predetermined value e.g. 5 amperes .

If the detected current i exceeds the predetermined value that is the DC motor continues to be energized for rotation with the reel shaft in the locked state the duty ratio of the control signal delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver is detected at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the detected duty ratio falls within a range between a first predetermined value e.g. 60 and a second predetermined value e.g. 70 . This is for determining whether the duty ratio of the control signal is included within a range of duty ratio within which the duty ratio should fall in changing the rotational acceleration of the DC motor from the low degree of rotational acceleration to the desired high degree of rotational acceleration when the seatbelt locking mechanism functions normally.

If it is determined that the duty ratio falls within the above range it is determined at a step S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal followed by terminating the present processing.

On the other hand if it is determined that the duty ratio does not fall within the range between the first predetermined value and the second predetermined value it is determined at a step S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is abnormal and then a warning is given to the occupant by means of a display device or a warning light not shown to warn him of the abnormality of the seatbelt locking mechanism at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

If it is determined at the step S that the detected current i is below the predetermined value that is the DC motor continues to be energized for rotation with the reel shaft in the unlocked state the duty ratio of the control signal is further increased at a step S. Then it is determined at a step S whether the duty ratio of the control signal is the maximum i.e. 100 and if it is the maximum the processing proceeds to the step S whereas if it is not the maximum the processing returns to the step S.

In the figure a point A represents a duty ratio detected at the step S after it is determined at the step S that the detected current i exceeds the predetermined value e.g. 5 amperes . The duty ratio at the point A is 65 which falls within the range between the first and second predetermined values 60 70 the answer is YES at the step S . Therefore in this case it is determined that the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal step S .

On the other hand a point B represents a duty ratio detected at the step S after it is determined at the step S that the detected current i is below the predetermined value 5 amperes then the duty ratio is increased step S again the current i is detected step S and it is determined that the detected current i exceeds the predetermined value. The duty ratio at the point B is 80 which falls out of the range between the first and second predetermined values. Therefore in this case it is determined that the seatbelt locking mechanism is abnormal step S .

First to slowly protract the seatbelt to give a predetermined amount of looseness to the seatbelt after the seatbelt is attached to the occupant and made fit to his body a control signal commands rotation of the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction at a low speed i.e. a control signal commanding a change from a high degree of rotational acceleration to a desired low degree of rotational acceleration is delivered to the DC motor driver at a step S. More specifically the MPU gradually decreases the duty ratio of the control signal and responsive to this control signal the DC motor driver changes the rotational acceleration of the DC motor from a high degree of rotational acceleration to a low degree of rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction. The reel shaft then gradually decreases in rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction in unison with the rotational acceleration of the DC motor . If the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal it does not lock the reel shaft when the rotational acceleration of the reel shaft changes from the high degree of rotational acceleration to the desired low degree of rotational acceleration.

Then the current i flowing to the DC motor is detected based upon current flowing through the resistance r by the current detecting circuit C of the DC motor driver at a step S. It is determined at a step S whether the detected current i is below a predetermined value e.g. 5 amperes .

If the detected current i is below the predetermined value that is the DC motor continues to be energized for rotation with the reel shaft in the unlocked state the duty ratio of the control signal delivered from the MPU to the DC motor driver is detected at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the detected duty ratio falls within a range between a first predetermined value e.g. 30 and a second predetermined value e.g. 40 . This is for determining whether the duty ratio of the control signal is included within a range of duty ratio within which the duty ratio should fall in changing the rotational acceleration of the DC motor from the high degree of rotational acceleration to the desired low degree of rotational acceleration when the seatbelt locking mechanism functions normally.

If it is determined that the duty ratio falls within the above range it is determined at a step S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal followed by terminating the present processing.

On the other hand if it is determined that the duty ratio does not fall within the range between the first predetermined value and the second predetermined value it is determined at a step S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is abnormal and then a warning is given to the occupant by means of the display device or the warning light to warn him of the abnormality of the seatbelt locking mechanism at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

If it is determined at the step S that the detected current i exceeds the predetermined value that is the DC motor continues to be energized for rotation with the reel shaft in the locked state the duty ratio of the control signal is further decreased at a step S. Then it is determined at a step S whether the duty ratio of the control signal is the minimum i.e. 0 and if it is the minimum the processing proceeds to the step S whereas if it is not the minimum the processing returns to the step S.

In the figure a point C represents a duty ratio detected at the step S after it is determined at the step S that the detected current i is below the predetermined value 5 amperes . The duty ratio at the point C is 35 which falls within the range between the first and second predetermined values 30 40 the answer is YES at the step S . Therefore in this case it is determined that the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal step S .

On the other hand a point D represents a duty ratio detected at the step S after it is determined that the detected current i exceeds the predetermined value 5 amperes step S then the duty ratio is decreased step S again the current i is detected step S and it is determined that the detected current i is below the predetermined value 5 amperes . The duty ratio at the point D is 20 which falls out of the range between the first and second predetermined values. Therefore in this case it is determined that the seatbelt locking mechanism is abnormal step S .

In the present control processing fault diagnosis only when it is determined at both of the steps S and S in that the seatbelt locking mechanism is functioning normally it is finally determined that the same mechanism is normal while when it is determined at either the step S in or the step S in that the seatbelt locking mechanism is functioning abnormally it is immediately finally determined that the same mechanism is abnormal. Alternatively only when it is determined at both of the steps S and S that the seatbelt locking mechanism is abnormal it may be finally determined that the same mechanism is abnormal to avoid frequent warning due to noise or the like.

As described above according to the present embodiment a control signal which causes a change in the rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction from a low degree of rotational acceleration to a desired high degree of rotational acceleration is delivered to the DC motor driver the duty ratio of the control signal is detected and depending upon whether the detected duty ratio falls within a range between first and second predetermined values it is determined whether the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal or abnormal. On the other hand a control signal which causes a change in the rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction from a high degree of rotational acceleration to a desired low degree of rotational acceleration is delivered to the DC motor driver the duty ratio of the control signal is detected and depending upon whether the detected duty ratio falls within a range between first and second predetermined values it is determined whether the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal or abnormal. Since the fault diagnosis is made based upon results of the above two kinds of determinations accurate fault diagnosis of the seatbelt locking mechanism can be achieved.

Further since the results of the determinations steps S S S and S are notified via the display device or warning light steps S and it is possible to examine the cause of the fault and quickly take measures to repair the seatbelt locking mechanism.

Although in the present embodiment fault diagnosis is made based upon results of the two kinds of determinations a plurality of kinds of control signals commanding to cause changes in the rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction from different degrees of low rotational acceleration to different degrees of high rotational acceleration for example and or a plurality of kinds of control signals commanding to cause changes in the rotational acceleration in the seatbelt protracting direction from different degrees of high rotational acceleration to different degrees of low rotational acceleration for example may be delivered to the DC motor driver to carry out fault diagnosis based upon more than two kinds of determinations.

Although in the above described eighteenth and nineteenth embodiments fault diagnosis of the seatbelt locking mechanism is carried out based upon the current i flowing to the DC motor and the duty ratios of control signals delivered to the DC motor driver alternatively fault diagnosis of the seatbelt locking mechanism may be carried out based upon output signals from sensors which sense whether the reel shaft is rotating whether the reel shaft pulley is rotating whether the DC motor pulley is rotating and or whether the power transmission belt is operating.

Further fault diagnosis of the seatbelt locking mechanism may be carried out by detecting acceleration applied to the vehicle during deceleration from the terminal voltage across the DC motor or other parameters and determining whether the seatbelt locking mechanism operates in response to the detected acceleration. More specifically when the acceleration applied to the vehicle exceeds a predetermined magnitude if the seatbelt locking mechanism operates it is determined that the seatbelt locking mechanism is normal while if the seatbelt locking mechanism does not operate it is determined that the seatbelt locking mechanism is abnormal. On the other hand when the acceleration applied to the vehicle is below a predetermined magnitude if the seatbelt locking mechanism operates it is determined that the mechanism is abnormal while if the seatbelt locking mechanism does not operate it is determined that the mechanism is normal.

Even by thus carrying out fault diagnosis of the seatbelt locking mechanism based upon acceleration applied to the vehicle accurate fault diagnosis of the seatbelt locking mechanism can be achieved.

Furthermore the acceleration applied to the vehicle may be detected by an acceleration sensor provided in the vehicle.

Although in the eighteenth and nineteenth embodiments results of the determinations as to abnormality of the seatbelt locking mechanism are notified by means of a display device or a warning light alternatively any other type of warning device may be provided to give a warning when abnormality of the seatbelt locking mechanism is detected as a result of the fault diagnosis.

An electric retractor provided in an automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a twentieth embodiment of the invention includes an A D converter not shown and a PWM signal output device not shown which are provided in the MPU . The A D converter converts the terminal voltage across the DC motor and current flowing to the DC motor to digital signals and the PWM signal output device delivers a PWM signal for controlling the current flowing to the DC motor to the DC motor driver . The terminals P to P of the DC motor driver in are connected to the A D converter.

The MPU receives voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF and based upon these voltage signals detects the current i flowing to the DC motor and an amount of change i in the current i with time. Further the MPU receives voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF and based upon these voltage detects the terminal voltage across the DC motor and an amount of change v in the terminal voltage with time. Then the MPU causes the PWM signal output device to deliver the PWM signal based upon the detected amounts of change i and v to the DC motor driver to control the current i flowing to the DC motor . The amounts of change i and v are parameters representative of a driving state and stopped state of the DC motor .

Except for those described above the electric retractor is identical in construction with the electric retractor description of which is therefore omitted.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected it is determined at a step S whether the magnitude v of the terminal voltage across the DC motor exceeds a predetermined value v e.g. 0.3 volts as taken with the sign corresponding to the seatbelt protracting direction.

If the magnitude v of the terminal voltage is below the predetermined value v the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter the PWM signal is delivered from the PWM signal output device to cause the current i to flow to the DC motor so as to facilitate protraction of the seatbelt at a step S. The amount of current i which is caused to flow to the DC motor at the step S is merely for facilitating protraction of the seatbelt that is for assisting the protraction of the seatbelt but is not sufficient to cause rotation of the reel shaft for itself. Then the reel shaft is rotated due to the seatbelt protraction assistance by the current i and the occupant s seatbelt protracting motion. Delivery of the PWM signal carried out at a step S hereinafter referred to is also for facilitating protraction of the seatbelt.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the amount of change i in the current i is below a predetermined value i e.g. 5 amperes sec and at the same time the former has been continuously below the latter over a predetermined time period t e.g. 3 sec . This determination is for determining whether the occupant has been continuously protracting the seatbelt or has stopped protracting the seatbelt after once protracting the same.

If it is determined at the step S that the amount of change i in the current i exceeds the predetermined value i or the former has not been continuously below the latter over the predetermined time period t the answer is NO at the step S it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the processing returns to the step S whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected the processing proceeds to a step S hereinafter referred to.

If it is determined at the step S that the amount of change i in the current i is below the predetermined value i and at the same time the former has been continuously below the latter over the predetermined time period t the answer is YES at the step S the PWM signal output device is caused to deliver the PWM signal to the DC motor driver to cause the current i to flow to the DC motor so as to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction in order to store the seatbelt which has been protracted in its retracted position at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the amount of change i in the current i is below the predetermined value i and at the same time the former has been continuously below the latter over a predetermined time period t e.g. 2 sec . If the amount of change i in the current i exceeds the predetermined value i or the former has not been continuously below the latter over the predetermined time period t the answer is NO at the step S the processing returns to the step S whereas if the amount of change i in the current i is below the predetermined value i and at the same time the former has been continuously below the latter over the predetermined time period t the answer is YES at the step S it is judged that the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit and then the PWM signal output device is caused to deliver a PWM signal commanding not to permit the current i to flow to the DC motor to the DC motor driver to thereby stop the driving of the DC motor at a step S followed by the processing returning to the step S.

If it is determined at the step S that the attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected the PWM signal output device is caused to deliver a PWM signal commanding to permit the current i to flow to the DC motor to the DC motor driver to thereby rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt retracting direction at the step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the amount of change i in the current i is below the predetermined value i and at the same time the former has been continuously below the latter over a predetermined time period t e.g. 0.1 sec . If the amount of change i in the current i exceeds the predetermined value i or the former has not been continuously below the latter over the predetermined time period t the answer is NO at the step S the processing returns to the step S whereas if the amount of change i in the current i is below the predetermined value i and at the same time the former has been continuously below the latter over the predetermined time period t the answer is YES at the step S it is judged that the seatbelt has become fit to the occupant and thus the retraction of the seatbelt has reached its limit and then the PWM signal output device is caused to deliver a PWM signal commanding to permit the current i to flow to the DC motor to the DC motor driver to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction so as to give a predetermined amount of looseness to the occupant at a step S. The amount of current i which is permitted to flow at the step S is sufficient to rotate the reel shaft for itself.

Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period t e.g. 1 sec has elapsed after the PWM signal was delivered at the step S based upon the value of the timer . If the predetermined time period t has not elapsed the processing returns to the step S whereas if it has elapsed then a predetermined amount of looseness has been given to the occupant and then the PWM signal output device is caused to deliver a PWM signal to the DC motor driver to permit the current i to flow to the DC motor so as to rotate the DC motor in the seatbelt protracting direction in order to stop the retraction of the seatbelt by the bias force of the bias force imparting means formed e.g. of a spiral spring acting upon the seatbelt in the retracting direction at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the processing returns to the step S whereas attaching of the seatbelt has been detected it is determined at a step S whether the amount of change v in the terminal voltage across the DC motor exceeds a predetermined value v e.g. 10 volts sec .

If the amount of change v in the terminal voltage across the DC motor does not exceed the predetermined value v the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former exceeds the latter it is judged that protraction of the seatbelt has been made by the occupant after attaching the seatbelt to his body and then the PWM signal output device is caused to deliver a PWM signal to the DC motor driver to permit the current i to flow to the DC motor so as to facilitate protraction of the seatbelt at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the amount of change i in the current i is below the predetermined value i and at the same time the former has been continuously below the latter over a predetermined time period t e.g. 0.3 sec . If the amount of change i in the current i exceeds the predetermined value i or the former has not been continuously below the latter over the predetermined time period t the answer is NO at the step S the processing returns to the step S whereas if the amount of change i in the current i is below the predetermined value i and at the same time the former has been continuously below the latter over the predetermined time period t the answer is YES at the step S it is judged that the protraction of the seatbelt by the occupant has ceased and then the PWM signal output device is caused to deliver a PWM signal commanding not to permit the current i to flow to the DC motor to the DC motor driver to stop the driving of the DC motor at a step S.

Then it is determined at a step S whether the magnitude v of the terminal voltage across the DC motor exceeds a predetermined value v e.g. 0.3 volts as taken with the sign corresponding to the seatbelt protracting direction.

If the magnitude v of the terminal voltage exceeds the predetermined value v it is judged that protraction of the seatbelt has been again carried out by the occupant and then the processing returns to the step S in order to assist the protraction of the seatbelt whereas if the magnitude v of the terminal voltage does not exceed the predetermined value v it is determined at a step S whether retraction of the seatbelt due to the bias force of the bias force imparting means is being carried out that is whether the magnitude v of the terminal voltage across the DC motor exceeds a predetermined value v e.g. 0.1 volts as taken with the sign corresponding to the seatbelt retracting direction.

If the magnitude of the terminal voltage across the DC motor exceeds the predetermined value v the processing returns to the step S whereas if the former does not exceed the latter it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period t e.g. 1 sec has elapsed after the driving of the DC motor was stopped at the step S. If the predetermined time period t has not elapsed the processing returns to the step S whereas if the predetermined time period t has elapsed the processing returns to the step S.

As described above according to the present embodiment the current i flowing to the DC motor is controlled based upon results of the detection by the buckle connection detector the amount of change i in the current i with time and the amount of change v in the terminal voltage v with time. Therefore an expensive displacement detecting device is not required to control the driving of the DC motor . As a result the manufacturing cost can be reduced and the construction of the automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus can be simplified.

Further the MPU can directly detect the amount of change i in the current i with time and the amount of change v in the terminal voltage v with time and hence can achieve more accurate control of the DC motor.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a twenty first embodiment of the invention includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor except that the IFs IF and IF of the DC motor driver do not have capacitors C description of which is therefore omitted.

The MPU is comprised of a digital filtering block high pass filter for extracting only pulsating components from voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF a counting block for counting a number of times the extracted pulsating components rises a predetermined voltage v e.g. 1 volt from a level below the predetermined voltage a protraction retraction amount calculating block for calculating an amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt based upon a count value obtained by the counting block a digital filtering block low pass filter for removing only pulsating components from the voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF and a motor rotational direction detecting block for detecting whether the rotational direction of the DC motor is in the seatbelt protracting direction or in the seatbelt retracting direction based upon the sign of the voltage signals with pulsating components removed therefrom.

Next the operation of these blocks of the electric retractor for calculating the protraction amount or the retraction amount of the seatbelt will be described.

When the seatbelt has been protracted by the occupant or retracted by the bias force imparting means formed e.g. of a spiral spring the reel shaft is rotated and the rotation is transmitted through the reel shaft pulley the DC motor pulley and the power transmission belt to the rotary shaft of the DC motor to rotate the same whereby an electromotive force is generated. The A D converter samples the resulting voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF every predetermined time period.

In the digital filtering block the voltage signal from the IF IF is subtracted from the voltage signal from the IF IF and the resulting difference voltage is subjected to high pass filtering to extract only pulsating components therefrom. The counting block counts the number of times the extracted pulsating components rises above the predetermined value v from a level below the same and a signal indicative of the count value is delivered to the protraction retraction amount calculating block .

On the other hand in the digital filtering block the voltage signal from the IF IF is subtracted from the voltage signal from the IF IF and the resulting difference voltage is subjected to low pass filtering to remove only pulsating components therefrom. The resulting voltage signal free of pulsating components is delivered to the motor rotational direction detecting block which in turn detects whether the rotational direction of the DC motor is in the seatbelt protracting direction or in the seatbelt retracting direction based upon the sign of the voltage signals free of pulsating components and delivers a signal indicative of results of the detection to the protraction retraction amount calculating block .

In the protraction retraction amount calculating block the count value from the counting block is multiplied by a predetermined value e.g. 10 cm 1 count and the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt is calculated based upon the resulting product and the signal indicative of the detected rotational direction of the DC motor from the motor rotational direction detecting block .

As described above according to the present embodiment the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt is calculated based upon a count value indicative of the number of times the pulsating components of the voltage difference signal obtained by subtracting the voltage signal from the IF IF from the voltage signal from the IF IF i.e. terminal voltage across the DC motor rise above the predetermined voltage v from a level below the same and the rotational direction of the DC motor detected based upon the sign of the voltage signals free of pulsating components from the IFs IF and IF. As a result the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt can be detected with ease and with high accuracy.

Although in the present embodiment the number of times the pulsating components of the voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF rise above the predetermined voltage v from a level below the same is counted a number of times the pulsating components drop below a predetermined voltage v e.g. 1 volt from a level above the same may be counted and a signal indicative of the counted number of times may be delivered to the protraction retraction amount calculating block providing substantially the same results.

Although in the present embodiment the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt is calculated a count value per unit time e.g. 2 counts 1 sec may be multiplied by a predetermined value e.g. 10 cm 1 count to obtain a product indicative of the seatbelt protracting or retracting speed 10 cm 1 count 2 counts 1 sec 20 cm 1 sec and thus the seatbelt protracting or retracting speed may also be detected.

A twenty second embodiment of the invention is identical with the above described twenty first embodiment except for the contents of arithmetic processing executed by the MPU and therefore only description of the arithmetic processing according to the present embodiment will be described hereinbelow.

The MPU is comprised of an integrating block for time integrating the terminal voltage across the DC motor a protraction retraction amount calculating block for calculating the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt from an output from the integrating block a digital filtering block for removing only pulsating components from the voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF and a motor rotational direction detecting block for detecting whether the rotational direction of the DC motor is in the seatbelt protracting direction or in the seatbelt retracting direction based upon the sign of the voltage signals with pulsating components removed therefrom.

Next the operation of these blocks of the electric retractor according to the present embodiment for calculating the protraction amount or the retraction amount of the seatbelt will be described.

In the integrating block the voltage signal from the IF IF is subtracted from the voltage signal from the IF IF and the resulting voltage difference signal is subjected to time integration. The resulting integral value is proportional to the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt because the DC motor generates an electromotive force of a magnitude proportional to the rotational speed thereof and hence a value obtained by time integrating the terminal voltage across the DC motor e.i. the difference voltage obtained by subtracting the voltage signal from the IF IF from the voltage signal from the IF IF is proportional to the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt. Thereafter the integrating block delivers the integral value to the protraction retraction amount calculating block .

The processing by the digital filtering block is identical with the processing described above with respect to the twenty first embodiment description of which is therefore omitted.

In the protraction retraction amount calculating block the integral value from the integrating block is multiplied by a predetermined value and the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt is calculated based upon the resulting product and a signal indicative of the detected rotational direction of the DC motor from the motor rotational direction detecting block .

As described above according to the present embodiment the terminal voltage across the DC motor is time integrated to obtain an integral value and the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt is calculated based upon the integral value and the rotational direction of the DC motor detected based upon the sign of the voltage difference signal obtained by subtracting the voltage signal from the IF IF from the voltage signal from the IF IF i.e. terminal voltage across the DC motor and having pulsating components thereof removed. As a result the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt can be detected with ease and with high accuracy.

A twenty third embodiment of the invention is identical with the above described twenty first embodiment except for the contents of arithmetic processing executed by the MPU and therefore only description of the arithmetic processing according to the present embodiment will be described hereinbelow.

The MPU is comprised of an FFT processing block for subjecting the voltage difference signal obtained by subtracting the voltage signal from the IF IF from the voltage signal from the IF IF to fast Fourier transform FFT to thereby obtain a frequency spectrum a frequency analysis block for calculating a frequency component of pulsating components of the terminal voltage across the DC motor from the frequency spectrum a protraction retraction amount calculating block for calculating an amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt from an output from the frequency analysis block a digital filtering block for removing only pulsating components from the voltage signals from the IFs IF and IF and a motor rotational direction detecting block for detecting whether the rotational direction of the DC motor is in the seatbelt protracting direction or in the seatbelt retracting direction based upon the sign of the voltage signals with pulsating components removed therefrom.

Next the operation of these blocks of the electric retractor according to the present embodiment for calculating the protraction amount or the retraction amount of the seatbelt will be described.

In the FFT processing block the voltage difference signal obtained by subtracting the voltage signal from the interface circuit IF from the voltage signal from the interface circuit IF is subjected to fast Fourier transform FFT to thereby obtain a frequency spectrum. In the frequency analysis block a frequency component of pulsating components of the terminal voltage across the DC motor is calculated from the frequency spectrum. The calculated frequency components are proportional to the protracting or retracting speed of the seatbelt. The calculated frequency component is delivered to the protraction retraction amount calculating block .

The processing by the digital filtering block is identical with the processing described above with respect to the twenty first embodiment description of which is omitted.

In the protraction retraction amount calculating block the frequency component from the frequency analysis block is multiplied by a predetermined value and the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt is calculated based upon the resulting product and a signal indicative of the detected rotational direction of the DC motor from the motor rotational direction detecting block .

As described above according to the present embodiment the voltage difference signal obtained by subtracting the voltage signal from the IF IF from the voltage signal from the IF IF is subjected to fast Fourier transform FFT to thereby obtain a frequency spectrum from which a frequency component of pulsating components of the terminal voltage across the DC motor is calculated and the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt is calculated based upon the calculated frequency component and the rotational direction of the DC motor detected based upon the sign of the voltage difference signal obtained by subtracting the voltage signal from the interface circuit IF from the voltage signal from the IF IF i.e. terminal voltage across the DC motor and having pulsating components thereof removed. As a result the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt can be detected with ease and with high accuracy.

The seatbelt protraction retraction amount calculating processes of the twenty first to twenty third embodiments may be used in suitable combination to thereby calculate the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt with more ease and higher accuracy.

Connected to a supply voltage input terminal of the electric retractor are one of contacts of a relay an emitter of a transistor a supply voltage input terminal of the temperature sensor which detects temperature in the vicinity of the DC motor or the temperature of the DC motor itself and an anode of a diode .

The other contact of the relay one end of a coil of the relay and a collector of the transistor are connected to a positive terminal of a battery with the other end of the coil of the relay being connected to one end of a resistance .

The other end of the resistance is connected to one end of an ignition switch for starting the engine of the vehicle with the other end of the ignition switch being grounded. A negative terminal of the battery is grounded.

Connected to the MPU are the electric retractor buckle connection detector temperature sensor ignition switch and a base of the transistor such that the MPU monitors and controls the electric retractor temperature sensor ignition switch and transistor .

The electric retractor may be replaced by any other electric retractor such as the electric retractor in .

The control operation of the automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to the present embodiment constructed as above will now be described with reference to .

First when the ignition switch is off no current flows from the battery to the coil of the relay with the contacts being open whereby no supply voltage is delivered from the battery to the electric retractor MPU and buckle connection detector .

Thereafter when the ignition switch is turned on current flows from the battery to the coil of the relay to close the contacts whereby supply voltage is delivered from the battery to the electric retractor 100 MPU and buckle connection detector . Then the MPU detects voltage applied to the ignition switch to thereby monitor on and off states of the ignition switch .

The temperature sensor delivers a signal indicative of the detected temperature in the vicinity of the DC motor or the temperature of the DC motor itself to the MPU and the buckle connection detector detects whether the seatbelt tongue has been attached to the buckle or released from the buckle and delivers a signal indicative of results of the detection to the MPU .

Upon receiving a signal indicating that the seatbelt tongue has been released from the buckle the MPU delivers a control signal to the DC motor driver so as to apply supply voltage V which is expressed by the following formula 11 to the DC motor . over a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec 11 where VB represents the output voltage from the battery initial value 12 volts k a control coefficient e.g. 2.7 T time elapsed after release from the buckle and r a temperature coefficient.

Thereafter the MPU delivers to the DC motor driver a control signal having a cycle of 2 seconds for example in such a manner as to inhibit the supply voltage V from being applied to the DC motor for a predetermined time period e.g. 1.9 sec and upon the lapse of the predetermined time period allow supply voltage V of 4 volts to be applied to the DC motor for a predetermined time period e.g. 0.1 sec and then again inhibit the supply voltage V from being applied to the DC motor for the above mentioned predetermined time period e.g. 1.9 sec . The delivery of the control signal is continued until the ignition switch is turned off. By this control the supply voltage V applied to the DC motor changes as shown in in such a manner that first the supply voltage V is 0 volts for 1.9 seconds then rises to and is held at 4 volts for 0.1 seconds and again drops to and is held at 0 volts for 1.9 seconds. In this way the supply voltage is applied to the DC motor in a manner changing in a cycle of 2 seconds for example.

According to the above described control by the MPU the seatbelt is slowly retracted to eliminate the disadvantage with the conventional apparatus that since supply voltage of a predetermined value continues to be applied to the DC motor in storing the seatbelt the seatbelt is suddenly retracted by the DC motor such that the seatbelt tongue can be hit against the side window pane.

Next when the ignition switch is turned off supply of current from the battery to the coil of the relay is stopped whereby the contacts of the relay are opened with a time lag of 10 ms for example and accordingly the delivery of supply voltage from the battery to the electric retractor MPU and buckle connection detector is stopped.

As described above according to the present embodiment the MPU controls the application of the supply voltage to the DC motor in such a cyclic manner that the supply voltage V is progressively decreased from a rate value of 12 volts for example for a first predetermined time period e.g. 3 seconds as time elapses after release of the seatbelt tongue from the buckle then is decreased to and held at a predetermined low level e.g. 0 volts for a second predetermined time period e.g. 1.9 seconds and then increased to and held at a predetermined high level e.g. 4 volts for a third predetermined time period e.g. 0.1 seconds and thereafter the same cyclic control of the supply voltage is repeated with a cycle of 2 seconds for example.

As a result the seatbelt can be slowly brought into a retracted position while eliminating the above mentioned disadvantage with the conventional apparatus.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a twenty fifth embodiment is identical in construction with the apparatus according to the above described twenty fourth embodiment description of which is therefore omitted.

The present embodiment is distinguished from the twenty fourth embodiment in the manner of control executed by the MPU in supplying the supply voltage to the electric retractor .

The control operation of the present embodiment will now be described only with respect to those which are different from the manner of control of the twenty fourth embodiment.

Upon receiving a signal indicating that the seatbelt tongue has been released from the buckle the MPU delivers an ON OFF control signal having a reference frequency of 20 kHz and a duty ratio D expressed by the following formula 12 to the DC motor driver over a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec so as to apply a predetermined supply voltage V to the DC motor 100 12 where a represents a control coefficient e.g. 23.3 .

Thus the predetermined supply voltage is applied to the DC motor in an on off manner with a frequency corresponding to the duty ratio determined by the above formula 12 .

As shown in the duty ratio of the ON OFF control signal delivered to the DC motor driver is progressively decreased with elapsed time T after release of the seatbelt tongue from the buckle according to the formula 12 .

Thereafter as shown in the MPU sets and holds the duty ratio to and at 0 for 1.9 seconds and then sets and holds the duty ratio to and at 30 for 0.1 seconds followed by again setting and holding the duty ratio to and at 0 for 1.9 seconds. In this way the ON OFF control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver with the duty ratio cyclically changing in a cycle of 2 seconds.

By the above control of the duty ratio supply voltage which gradually decreases in response to the ON OFF control signal having a duty ratio progressively decreased from 100 to 30 with the lapse of time for a first predetermined time period 3 sec after release of the seatbelt from the buckle and then no supply voltage is applied to the DC motor for a second predetermined time period 1.9 seconds then the supply voltage is applied to the DC motor at a voltage corresponding to the duty ratio of 30 of the ON OFF control signal for a third predetermined time period 0.1 seconds and then again no supply voltage is applied to the DC motor for the second predetermined time period 1.9 seconds and thereafter the same cyclic control of the supply voltage is repeated.

According to the above described control by the MPU the seatbelt is slowly retracted so that the aforementioned disadvantage with the conventional apparatus can be eliminated.

As described above according to the present embodiment the MPU controls the duty ratio of the ON OFF control signal delivered to the DC motor driver in such a cyclic manner that the supply voltage V of a predetermined value is applied to the DC motor in an on off manner with a frequency corresponding to the duty ratio of the control signal which is progressively decreased for a first predetermined time period e.g. 3 seconds as time elapses after release of the seatbelt tongue from the buckle then set to and held at a predetermined low duty ratio e.g. 0 for a second predetermined time period e.g. 1.9 seconds and then set to and held at a predetermined high duty ratio e.g. 30 for a third predetermined time period e.g. 0.1 seconds and thereafter the same cyclic control of the duty ratio is repeated with a cycle of 2 seconds for example. As a result the seatbelt can be slowly brought into a retracted position while eliminating the above mentioned disadvantage with the conventional apparatus.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a twenty sixth embodiment is identical in construction with the apparatus according to the above described twenty fourth embodiment description of which is therefore omitted.

The present embodiment is distinguished from the twenty fourth embodiment in the timing of supplying the supply voltage to the electric retractor .

The control operation of the present embodiment will now be described only with respect to those which are different from the manner of control of the twenty fourth embodiment.

In the present embodiment even after turning off of the ignition switch supply of the supply voltage to the electric retractor the DC motor driver etc. is continued for a predetermined time period within which retraction of the seatbelt can be completed by the electric retractor after release of the seatbelt from the buckle to thereby carry out retraction of the seatbelt by the electric motor when the seatbelt is released from the occupant after turning off of the ignition switch. This can prevent the seatbelt tongue from being caught in the door.

Simultaneously upon turning off of the ignition switch the MPU delivers a high level signal to the base of the transistor to turn the same on whereby supply voltage from the battery is supplied via the transistor to the electric retractor MPU buckle connection detector and temperature sensor .

Then upon receiving a signal indicating that the seatbelt tongue has been released from the buckle the MPU carries out the control of application of the supply voltage to the DC motor in the same manner as described with respect to the twenty fourth embodiment and with reference to that is by progressively decreasing the supply voltage applied to the DC motor for a predetermined time period e.g. 3 seconds after release of the seatbelt tongue from the buckle and then carrying out the above described cyclic control of the supply voltage applied to the DC motor .

When the predetermined time period within which the retraction of the seatbelt can be completed by the electric retractor has elapsed after the MPU delivered the high level signal to the base of the transistor the MPU delivers a low level signal to the base of the transistor to turn the same off whereby the supply of the supply voltage to the electric retractor DC motor driver etc. is stopped. Thus the battery can be prevented from being wastefully consumed and deteriorated.

As described above according to the present embodiment also after the ignition switch is turned off the supply voltage is delivered to the electric retractor DC motor driver etc. so that after release of the seatbelt from the occupant the retraction of the seatbelt is carried out by the electric retractor to thereby prevent the seatbelt tongue from being caught in the door to be damaged. Further on this occasion the control of application of the supply voltage to the DC motor in the same manner as described with respect to the twenty fourth embodiment by progressively decreasing the supply voltage applied to the DC motor for a predetermined time period after release of the seatbelt tongue from the buckle and then carrying out the cyclic control of the supply voltage applied to the DC motor the same results as those obtained by the twenty fourth embodiment as mentioned above can be obtained.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a twenty seventh embodiment of the invention includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor description of which is therefore omitted.

The MPU is required to detect whether the rotative driving of the DC motor is stopped in order to ascertain that the seatbelt has been wound up and completely retracted in its proper retracted position as well as that the seatbelt has become fit to the occupant s body. Further protracting of the seatbelt by the occupant is made against the bias force of the spiral spring provided inside the pulley for the reel shaft which acts upon the seatbelt in the seatbelt retracting direction. The MPU is also required to detect whether the rotative driving of the DC motor is stopped in order to ascertain that the protracting of the seatbelt by the occupant is not being carried out.

As a manner of determining the stoppage of the DC motor it is employed to detect whether the value of current flowing to the DC motor exceeds a predetermined value and determine that the rotative driving of the DC motor is stopped if the detected current value exceeds the predetermined value.

Further as a manner of more exactly determining the stoppage of the DC motor it is employed to vary the above mentioned predetermined value in response to environmental conditions under which the DC motor is operated.

First when the DC motor is not rotatively driven that is neither protraction of the seatbelt nor retraction of the same is being carried out supply voltage applied to the DC motor is measured at a step S and then based upon the measured supply voltage a value ik of current that should flow to the DC motor when the DC motor has been stopped is calculated at a step S. The current value ik is used as a threshold value for determining whether the DC motor has shifted from a rotatively driven state to a stopped state. A reference value of the supply voltage to be applied to the DC motor and a reference value of the threshold current value ik are stored in a memory within the MPU . If the supply voltage measured at the step S is higher than the reference value of the supply voltage the threshold current value ik is calculated to a value larger than the reference value thereof whereas if the supply voltage measured at the step S is lower than the reference value of the supply voltage the threshold current value ik is calculated to a value smaller than the reference value thereof.

Then it is determined at a step S whether driving of the DC motor for retracting the seatbelt is required. If the driving is not required the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if the driving is required a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to rotate the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S whereby the seatbelt is retracted.

Then current i flowing to the DC motor is detected from current flowing through the resistance r by the current detecting circuit C at a step S and then it is determined at a step S whether the detected current i is larger than the threshold current value ik. If the detected current i exceeds the threshold current value ik that is if the seatbelt has not been retracted to its limit and has not become completely fit to the occupant s body and accordingly the DC motor has not shifted from a rotatively driven state to a stopped state the processing returns to the step S whereas if the detected current i exceeds the threshold current value ik that is if the seatbelt has been retracted to its limit and has become completely fit to the occupant s body and accordingly the DC motor has shifted from a rotatively driven state to a stopped state the present processing is terminated.

As described above according to the present embodiment even when the supply voltage applied to the DC motor varies due to environmental conditions under which the DC motor is operated the supply voltage is measured step S . Based upon the measured supply voltage the threshold current value ik for determining whether the DC motor has shifted from a rotatively driven state to a stopped state is calculated step S and thereafter it is determined whether the current i flowing to the DC motor is larger than the calculated threshold current value ik. Since the threshold current value ik is set based upon the supply voltage detected when the DC motor is not rotatively driven the determination as to whether the DC motor is actually stopped can be made with accuracy irrespective of environmental conditions under which the DC motor is operated. The threshold current value ik may be set based upon the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the DC motor or the temperature of the DC motor itself instead of or together with the supply voltage.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a twenty eighth embodiment of the invention includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor description of which is therefore omitted.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to rotate the DC motor so as to cause rotation of the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S whereby the seatbelt is retracted. On this occasion the timer measures time elapsed after the control signal starts to be delivered to the DC motor driver .

Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 3 sec has elapsed after the control signal started to be delivered to the DC motor driver . If the predetermined time period has elapsed a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to stop the driving of the DC motor whereby the DC motor is stopped to stop the retraction of the seatbelt by the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction. It is assumed that on this occasion the seatbelt is not locked by the seatbelt locking mechanism . Further on this occasion the timer measures time elapsed after the control signal for stopping the driving of the DC motor starts to be delivered to the DC motor driver .

Then it is determined at a step S whether protraction of the seatbelt has been made. If protraction of the seatbelt has not been made the seatbelt protraction control of described before is executed followed by terminating the present processing.

If protraction of the seatbelt has not been made the supply voltage applied to the DC motor is measured at a step S. Then based upon the measured supply voltage the threshold current value ik is calculated at a step S. Then it is determined at a step S whether a predetermined time period e.g. 10 sec has elapsed after the control signal for stopping the driving of the DC motor started to be delivered to the DC motor driver . If the predetermined time period has not elapsed the processing returns to the step S whereas if it has elapsed a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to again drive the DC motor to cause rotation of the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S whereby the seatbelt is retracted.

Then the current i flowing to the DC motor is detected from current flowing through the resistance r by the current detecting circuit C at a step S and then it is determined at a step S whether the detected current i is larger than the threshold current value ik. If the detected current i is below the threshold current value ik that is if the seatbelt has not been retracted to its limit and has not completely become fit to the occupant s body so that the DC motor has not shifted from a rotatively driven state to a stopped state the processing returns to the step S whereas if the detected current i exceeds the threshold current value ik that is if the DC motor has shifted from the rotatively driven state to a stopped state the present processing is terminated.

As described above according to the present embodiment even when the supply voltage applied to the DC motor varies due to environmental conditions under which the DC motor is operated the supply voltage is measured step S and based upon the measured supply voltage the threshold current value ik for determining whether the DC motor has shifted from a rotatively driven state to a stopped state is calculated step S and thereafter it is determined whether the current i flowing to the DC motor is larger than the calculated threshold current value ik. Since the threshold current value ik is set based upon the supply voltage detected when the DC motor is not rotatively driven the determination as to whether the DC motor is actually stopped can be made with accuracy irrespective of environmental conditions under which the DC motor is operated. The threshold current value ik may be set based upon the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the DC motor or the temperature of the DC motor itself instead of or together with the supply voltage.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a twenty ninth embodiment of the invention includes an electric retractor which is identical in construction with the electric retractor description of which is therefore omitted.

First it is determined at a step S whether attaching of the seatbelt tongue to the buckle has been detected by the buckle connection detector . If attaching of the seatbelt has not been detected the present processing is immediately terminated whereas if attaching of the seatbelt has been detected the supply voltage applied to the DC motor is measured at a step S and based upon the measured supply voltage a threshold current value im for determining whether the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is to be progressively decreased from a rotatively driven state is calculated at a step S. A reference value of the threshold current value im as well as the reference value of the supply voltage to be applied to the DC motor are stored in the memory within the MPU . If the supply voltage measured at the step S is higher than the reference value of the supply voltage the threshold current value im is calculated to a value larger than the reference value thereof whereas if the supply voltage measured at the step S is lower than the reference value of the supply voltage the threshold current value im is calculated to a value smaller than the reference value thereof.

Then a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to drive the DC motor to cause rotation of the reel shaft at a predetermined rotational speed in the seatbelt retracting direction at a step S whereby the seatbelt is retracted so that the urging force that the occupant receives from the seatbelt progressively increases and accordingly the seatbelt retracting speed of the reel shaft progressively decreases.

Then the current i flowing to the DC motor is detected from current flowing through the resistance r by the current detecting circuit C at a step S and then it is determined at a step S whether the detected current i is larger than the threshold current value im. If the detected current i is below the threshold current value im the processing returns to the step S whereas if the detected current i exceeds the threshold current value im a control signal is delivered to the DC motor driver to further decrease the rotational speed of the reel shaft in the seatbelt retracting direction so as to progressively decrease the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt at a step S followed by terminating the present processing.

As described above according to the present embodiment even when the supply voltage applied to the DC motor varies due to environmental conditions under which the DC motor is operated the supply voltage is measured step S . Based upon the measured supply voltage the threshold current value im for determining whether the driving force of the reel shaft for retracting the seatbelt is to be progressively decreased from a current value is calculated step S . and thereafter it is determined whether the current i actually flowing to the DC motor is larger than the calculated threshold current value im. Since the threshold current value im is set based upon the supply voltage detected when the DC motor is not rotatively driven the determination as to whether the DC motor is actually stopped can be made with accuracy irrespective of environmental conditions under which the DC motor is operated. The threshold current value im may be set based upon the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the DC motor or the temperature of the DC motor itself instead of or together with the supply voltage.

Although in the twenty seventh to twenty ninth embodiments described above the current i flowing through the resistance r is detected from current flowing through the resistance r this is not limitative but any other suitable method may be used to detect the current i.

An automotive passenger restraint and protection apparatus according to a thirtieth embodiment of the invention includes an electric retractor which is an improved version of the electric retractor and includes each one pair of reel shaft pulleys motor pulleys power transmission belts DC motors and DC motor drivers.

The seatbelt retractor has a frame in which is rotatably mounted a reel shaft takeup shaft for retracting and protracting a seatbelt. Secured to an end of the reel shaft is a known seatbelt locking mechanism which is adapted to lock or stop the seatbelt from being protracted when a predetermined or higher degree of deceleration is applied to an automotive vehicle in which the present apparatus is installed or when the seatbelt is protracted at a predetermined or higher degree of acceleration.

The reel shaft has a central shaft coupled to a central shaft of a first reel shaft pulley and a central shaft of a second reel shaft pulley . The first reel shaft pulley is coupled to a first DC motor pulley via a first power transmission belt . The second reel shaft pulley is coupled to a second DC motor pulley via a second power transmission belt .

The first reel shaft pulley and the first DC motor pulley each have an outer periphery thereof formed with a predetermined number of outer teeth while the first power transmission belt has an inner periphery thereof formed with a predetermined number of inner teeth which are in mesh with the outer teeth of the first reel shaft pulley and the first DC motor pulley .

Similarly the second reel shaft pulley and the second DC motor pulley each have an outer periphery thereof formed with a predetermined number of outer teeth while the second power transmission belt has an inner periphery thereof formed with a predetermined number of inner teeth which are in mesh with the outer teeth of the second reel shaft pulley and the second DC motor pulley .

The first DC motor pulley has a central shaft thereof coupled to a first DC motor and the second DC motor pulley has a central shaft thereof coupled to a second DC motor such that the rotation of the first DC motor is transmitted to the reel shaft via the first DC motor pulley and the rotation of the second DC motor is transmitted to the reel shaft via the second DC motor pulley .

The first and second DC motors are each fixed to the frame at at least two points and are connected to an MPU Micro Processing Unit via respective first and second DC motor drivers . The first and second DC motor drivers control the first and second DC motors respectively based upon PWM signals from the MPU .

The first and second DC motor drivers both have a construction which is identical with the construction of the DC motor driver shown in description of which is therefore omitted.

The MPU has a built in timer for measuring time. Connected to the MPU are a buckle connection detector which detects whether the seatbelt has been attached to the buckle or disconnected therefrom and delivers a signal indicative of results of the detection to the MPU and a collision predictor which predicts a possible collision of the vehicle.

The collision predictor has a distance sensor provided therein which detects the distance between the present automotive vehicle and an object lying ahead of the vehicle and delivers a signal indicative of the detected distance to the collision predictor . The collision predictor calculates a collision unavoidableness distance dd m by the use of the following formula 14 and when the calculated distance dd is larger than the distance indicated by the signal from the collision sensor the collision predictor delivers a signal indicative of a collision being unavoidable to the MPU 14 where Vr represents relative speed m sec and td response delay of the driver e.g. 0.5 to 2 sec. .

First when the first DC motor is energized or rotatively driven while the second DC motor is kept deenergized in a non driven state the reel shaft is rotated by the rotating first DC motor and the second DC motor is caused to rotate in unison with the rotation of the reel shaft . On this occasion since the gear ratio between the first reel shaft pulley and the first DC motor pulley is set to the same value as the gear ratio between the second reel shaft pulley and the second DC motor pulley the rotational speed of the first DC motor which is rotatively driven is the same as the second DC motor which is not energized for rotation.

While the first DC motor is energized to be rotatively driven and the second DC motor is not energized for rotation but merely rotated in unison with the rotation of the reel shaft if the seatbelt is protracted by the occupant the MPU compares the DC motor terminal voltage or pulsating components contained therein between the first DC motor and the second DC motor and if the compared terminal voltage or pulsating components are equal between the first and second DC motors the MPU determines that the electric retractor is normal but if they are not equal the MPU determines that there is an abnormality in the electric retractor. The gear ratio between the first reel shaft pulley and the first DC motor pulley may be set to a different value from the gear ratio between the second reel shaft pulley and the second DC motor pulley . In this case by using a correction coefficient or the like dependent upon the difference in gear ratio the same fault diagnosis as above can be carried out.

Alternatively it may be determined that a driving system associated with the first DC motor is abnormal if the terminal voltage across the first DC motor or current flowing to the first DC motor is below a predetermined value e.g. 5 volts or 3 amperes even when a PWM signal is delivered from the MPU to the first DC motor driver . A driving system associated with the second DC motor may be diagnosed as to abnormality in a similar manner to the above.

Further alternatively a PWM signal may be delivered to the first DC motor driver to rotatively drive the first DC motor with a predetermined driving force and it may be determined whether the terminal voltage across the second DC motor which is then not energized or rotatively driven or pulsating components therein show a value corresponding to the predetermined driving force to thereby determine abnormality based upon results of the determination. In addition to this fault diagnosis conversely the first DC motor may be kept deenergized in a non driven state and the second DC motor energized to be rotatively driven and then the same determination as above may be carried out to thereby achieve fault diagnosis with higher reliability.

Next when the signal indicative of collision unavoidableness is delivered from the collision predictor to the MPU the MPU delivers a PWM signal to both of the first and second DC motor drivers to rotatively drive the first and second DC motors to retract the seatbelt with a large retracting force.

Assuming that the maximum value of the driving force for retracting the seatbelt that is required when the signal indicative of a collision being unavoidable from the collision predictor is received by the MPU is 100 N the maximum value of the driving force of each of the first and second DC motors may be set to 70 N. Then the maximum value of the combined driving force of the first and second DC motors and exceeds 100 N and therefore then the respective driving forces of the first and second DC motors have only to be adjusted so that the maximum value of the combined driving force becomes equal to 100 N. The first and second DC motors can be designed to be compact in size and light in weight and manufactured at a low cost.

Further for example if the first DC motor has a degraded driving force due to aging change or the like the ratio of driving force between the first and second DC motors may be changed by adjusting the pulse width of at least one of the PWM signals delivered to the respective DC motor drivers by the MPU so that the ratio of driving force of the second DC motor which is larger than that of the first DC motor whereby the driving force of the first DC motor can be utilized to the fullest extent. For example if the maximum value of the driving force of the first DC motor has decreased to 30 N the driving force of the second DC motor is set to the maximum value of 70 N when the signal indicative of a collision being unavoidable from the collision predictor is received to thereby enable securing a driving force required for retracting the seatbelt.

As described above according to the present embodiment when the driving force of the first DC motor has a degraded driving force for example the ratio of driving force between the first and second DC motors by adjusting the pulse width of at least one of PWM signals for the first and second DC motors delivered to the respective DC motor drivers by the MPU such that the ratio of driving force of the second DC motor becomes larger to thereby enable utilizing the driving force of the first DC motor to the fullest extent and hence fully exhibiting the driving force for retracting the seatbelt that is possessed by the first and second DC motors.

When the driving force of the first DC motor alone for example is sufficient to retract the seatbelt the second DC motor may be kept from being driven but used as a sensor for sensing the amount of protraction or retraction of the seatbelt.
