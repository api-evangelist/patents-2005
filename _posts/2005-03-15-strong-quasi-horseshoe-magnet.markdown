title: Strong quasi horseshoe magnet
abstract: A permanent magnet assembly, for engaging a generally planar surface of a ferromagnetic object to affix items of interest thereto, includes a shell of a magnetic material. The shell has a portion of either a magic sphere or a magic cylinder and a cavity and the shell terminates in a surface that is generally planar for engaging a ferromagnetic object. The permanent magnet assembly also has an insert located in the cavity. A method of fabricating the permanent magnet assembly is also presented.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used imported sold and licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America without the payment of any royalty thereon or there for.

The present invention relates generally to simple permanent magnets and more particularly to simple permanent magnets having an increased magnetic force.

There is considerable use for simple permanent magnets of the horseshoe and bar magnet varieties. Common uses include simple paper anchors on refrigerators field modifiers for more complex magnet systems the retrieval of iron and other magnetic objects location indicators for surgical implements and machine shop anchors and dogs. Generally these magnets are very limited in the strength of the magnetic field that they can generate.

Examples of permanent magnets having a relatively high field strength but that extends within an interior cavity of the magnet include permanent magnets configured in the form of a magic sphere or a magic cylinder. U.S. Pat. No. 5 216 401 describes each of these permanent magnet structures.

One way to further increase the field strength located within an interior cavity of a magic sphere or magic cylinder type of a permanent magnet is to employ a magnetic insert. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 382 936 5 428 334 and 5 428 335 each of which are incorporated by reference herein describe a permanent magnet assembly comprising a cylindrical or spherical shell of magnetic material having a hollow central cavity. The shell is permanently magnetized to produce a magnetic field within the central cavity and a magnetic insert is disposed in the central cavity to enhance the magnetic field therein.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a permanent magnet assembly for engaging a generally planar surface of a ferromagnetic object to affix items of interest thereto comprises a shell of a magnetic material. The shell comprises a portion of either a magic sphere or a magic cylinder and a cavity and the shell terminates in a surface that is generally planar for engaging a ferromagnetic object. The permanent magnet assembly also comprises an insert located in the cavity.

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention a method of fabricating a permanent magnet assembly for engaging a generally planar surface of a ferromagnetic object to affix items of interest thereto comprises providing a shell of a magnetic material that comprises a portion of either a magic sphere or a magic cylinder and wherein the shell also comprises a cavity and terminates in a surface that is generally planar for engaging a ferromagnetic object and locating an insert in the cavity.

The present invention concerns a permanent magnet assembly that has a significant increase in magnetic field strength over that of prior art horseshoe and bar magnets. In one embodiment the permanent magnet assembly may comprise a modified magic sphere or magic cylinder which provides for a relatively large magnetic field that extends away from the magnet rather than internal to it. In this way the permanent magnet assembly may function as a powerful lifting or securing magnet that is many times stronger than a prior art horseshoe or bar magnet while maintaining a relatively small structural mass and bulk.

Referring now to a permanent magnet assembly in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is illustrated generally at . In this embodiment the permanent magnet assembly comprises a shell and an insert which together may be attracted to an item of interest such as a plate . The shell may be composed of a magnetic material such as a cobalt rare earth or a rare earth iron and may comprise an arcuate portion diagrammatically shown in cross section of e.g. a magic sphere or a magic cylinder as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 216 401 and incorporated herein by reference. Briefly and in accordance with a magic sphere or cylinder the shell is composed of a magnetic material that is permanently magnetized in a direction such that the remanence varies continuously about a polar angle of the shell. The shell is shown for illustrational purposes as that of a portion of a magic sphere although it will be appreciated that a magic ring or cylinder may instead be employed to form a horseshoe like outer configuration.

The shell may also comprise a generally flat portion and a cavity . The insert may be configured to fit within the cavity and may also include a generally flat portion . The insert may comprise a ferromagnetic material such as iron. The plate is shown for illustrational purposes and may represent a portion of a refrigerator door or other such surface to which it is desired to releasably affix items not shown such as exemplary homework assignments or other items that would heretofore require a fastener.

The magnetization of the shell is represented in direction by arrows that may rotate in direction about the periphery of the shell and a uniform magnetic field represented by arrow is disposed within the cavity .

For a better understanding of the present invention and the magnetic field extending from and about the shell it may be first useful to describe the magnetization of a magic sphere as shown in and thereafter describe the combination of a magic sphere and a magnetic insert as shown in . It will be appreciated that a magic cylinder is similarly combinable with a magnetic insert to form a horseshoe like magnet although for brevity this is not described in detail.

Referring to a cross section of a magic sphere having a shell including a cavity is shown. A magnetization of the shell is represented by arrows and disposed within the cavity is a uniform field H represented by arrow which may be found by equation 1 . 4 3 r r 1 where 

The total force F of attraction to a passive material such as plate may be found under a known principle of virtual work by taking a derivative of energy stored in the gap . Accordingly the force F then may be represented by the energy density in the gap multiplied by a cross sectional area A of the gap as reflected in equation 2 . 8 A 2 where 

In view of the foregoing and referring again to the force F of attraction for the insert using for example an r r 2 r 1 cm for the flat portions and and an average field B that may be approximately 25 000 Gauss and or 2.5 Teslas for the permanent magnet assembly may be found by equation 3 25000 8 1 3 176 Pounds.

Next a force F of attraction exerted by the shell may be found given that an area of the flat portion may be found by r r 2 1 3 . Thereafter the force F by the shell may be determined by equation 4 . 25000 8 3 4 528 Pounds

In sum the total force F of attraction for the example permanent magnet assembly is 528 176 or 704 pounds. It will be appreciated that the dimensions of the example permanent magnet may be reduced to provide for a suitable total force of attraction depending on the application.

Referring now to a solid conventional permanent magnet comprising a hemispherical shape and being attracted to a plate is shown. The permanent magnet has a direction of magnetization represented by arrows and produces an anti image and magnetic field in the direction of arrows . The permanent magnet may comprise the same material as that of the shell described above and r 2 cm.

The total force F of attraction for the example permanent magnet assembly may compared to the force F of attraction of the solid conventional permanent magnet that is of the same dimension and material magnetized arrows perpendicular to the base which found by equations 5 and 6 . 2 3 5 

While the present invention has been described in connection with what are presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to these herein disclosed embodiments. Rather the present invention is intended to cover all of the various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
