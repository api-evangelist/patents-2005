Individual die packaged as separate components offer little inherent anti tamper protection when sensitive information needs to be passed between the components. In the past to improve the protection of the die and the interfaces between the die individual die have been directly applied to a single substrate and packaged as a multi chip module MCM system in package SiP . Next an over coating or over mold was applied to the MCM to improve the security of the sensitive data internal to the MCM on die and between the die . In some instances these over coatings and over molds detrimentally impacted the cost manufacturability and reliability of the MCM. In other instances these over coatings and over molds did not significantly improve the security of the MCM. Additionally this packaging technique could result in a rather large module ranging in size from over a square inch to several square inches.

An alternate approach is to combine all of the individual die into a single ASIC as a system on chip SoC design. SoC designs offer a high degree of inherent anti tamper protection and size reduction but may present significant risk to the design and development team. The combination of all the functions needed to create the SoC may be extremely complex. There may be incompatibilities between the memory needed or other features of the die and the die manufacturers capabilities. Additionally a single error in the ASIC may cost 250 000 for a metalization layer change to 1 000 000 for a complete respin to correct.

Another alternative approach is to stack the die within a single package. Current stacked die packaging techniques address size reduction but most offer little inherent anti tamper protection. Packaging options for stacked die packages come in many forms. The two basic options for intra package interconnect is bond wiring and bumping flip chip packaging . Wire bonding may connect the die to a laminate substrate using small wires from the top active face of the die down to the substrate. Multiple die are then stacked on top of each other and wire bonded down to a substrate. A flip chip package may basically include a thin core laminate substrate with the die inverted and soldered down using solder bumps on the die. The active face of the die may be directly connected to the substrate using a small solder bump. Multiple substrates are then stacked on top of each other either by ball grid array attachment or by wire bonding them down to a single bottom substrate. Wafer level flip chip technology is being developed. This technique refers to the direct attaching of a flip chip die to the active surface of a custom designed ASIC.

One feature is directed to forming a device by attaching a die to a silicon based circuit carrying substrate. The silicon based circuit carrying substrate may carry a plurality of die and or may be connected to other silicon based circuit carrying substrates which themselves may be carrying a die or a plurality of die.

Another feature is directed to forming a device that offers inherent anti tamper protection. Anti tamper protection does not necessarily mean that tampering can be prevented altogether but rather that the ability to tamper is hindered by the construction of the device. One method of providing anti tamper protection involves configuring a multi layer device in a manner that hinders access to die carrying the sensitive information.

These devices may have application to any number of different types of systems where protection of sensitive information is desired. Such systems may include GPS location determining devices communications devices and or other types of devices.

Other principle features and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the drawings the detailed description and the appended claims.

An electronic device may include a silicon circuit carrying substrate that is configured to carry one or more die. The silicon circuit carrying element may allow for a greater density of die and or smaller packages to be formed using the die. According to some embodiments the substrate comprises conductive traces having a line width of less than about 500 or about 200 microns. According to some of these embodiments the substrate comprises conductive traces having a line width of less than about 30 or about 15 microns.

The electronic device may include more than one silicon circuit carrying substrate and if so the silicon circuit carrying substrates may be closely coupled to each other.

An electronic device such as a device including a silicon circuit carrying substrate may be packaged in a manner that allows a higher degree of inherent anti tamper protection. The inherent anti tamper protection offered by the manner in which the device is packaged may reduce the need to rely on protective over coatings and over molds to prevent tampering with the die that are to be protected.

One method of protecting the die from tampering is to package the die in an area that is difficult to access without tampering with and or at least partially destroying the package particularly if it requires tampering with an active face of the die. The device may include the ability to monitor whether the package has been tampered with and may be configured to take precautionary measures e.g. removing data from the device halting operation of the device etc. in response to detection of tampering.

To achieve protection from tampering with a die an electronic device may include a first substrate connected to the die and a second substrate closely coupled to e.g. directly connected to or separated by few intervening bodie from the first substrate. The die is located between the two substrates. The close coupling of the first substrate and the second substrate makes access to the die more difficult without tampering with the connection between the two substrates. The device may also include underfill and or other potting material which material may create a stronger physical bond between the die the first substrate and the second substrate. Further the loss of interconnect between the first substrate and the second substrate may result in the device detecting the tampering and taking precautionary measures e.g. removing data from the device halting operation of the device etc. .

This information may be contained in one or more die which is are protected from tampering as discussed above.

A banking system may further include a mechanism for remote data entry a means to transmit the data and a server.

The GPS device may further include an antenna and or a receiver configured to receive data which data would likely be received from GPS satellites.
