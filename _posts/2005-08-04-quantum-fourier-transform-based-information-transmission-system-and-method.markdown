This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 598 537 filed Aug. 4 2004 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

This invention relates in general to methods and apparatus for processing compression and transmission of data using the quantum Fourier transform QFT and in particular to high information density transmission of acoustic data.

While quantum computing holds the prospect of rendering classically intractable computations feasible and open communication bandwidth to near infinite levels difficulties persist in preserving quantum coherence and the development of quantum computing algorithms. In spite of theoretical calculations showing enormous efficiency increases for quantum computers relative to classical computers such improvements have not been forthcoming in practice. The societal implications of data compression and transmission based on quantum computing algorithms are considerable. Transmission of voice image video and holographic signals in a lossy extremely highly compressed format would impact nearly every field of human endeavor.

Thus there exists a need for a system and process for quantum computing algorithm manipulation of data.

A method of data compression and transmission include splitting a wave function representative of an input data set into an arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state and a comparator wave function state the comparator wave function state being transmitted to a detector. A quantum Fourier transform is performed on the arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state to yield a quantum computational product. A quantum Hadamard transform is performed on the quantum computational product to yield one of two possible quantum particle outputs. The input data set is reconstructed based upon the coincident arrival of the comparator wave function state and one of the two quantum particle outputs. Data compression and transmission is performed on either a quantum computer or a digital computer. An optical bench with appropriate electronics is particularly well suited to function as a quantum computer for the compression and transmission of data corresponding to sound.

A data communication system operating on quantum computation principles includes a light source having a photon output coding an input data set. A Type I or Type II nonlinear crystal converts the photon output into an entangled photon output. An arbitrarily oriented polarization state is assured by passing the entangled photon output through a polarization modulator and a phase modulator. A polarization interferometer performs a controlled phase shift transform on the arbitrarily oriented polarization state as an interferometer output. A halfway plate then performs a quantum Hadamard gate transform to generate one of two possible photon states from the interferometer output thus completing the operations required for a quantum Fourier transform. Coincidence electronics reconstruct the input data set a distance from the light source. The reconstruction is based on the coincident arrival of the one of two possible photon states and at least one of the entangled photon output or the interferometer output.

The present invention has utility in data transmission. A quantum computing algorithm for processing data is detailed that has greater than classical efficiency when run on a quantum computer. It is appreciated that the present invention as a method for data compression and transmission is operative in a classical digital computing environment although without the superior speed and information storage properties of qubits that are realized on a quantum computer. While the present invention is hereafter detailed in the context of sound compression and transmission it is appreciated that data corresponding to any number of media are equally well suited for transmission in a highly compressed and lossy manner. Data set types other than sound readily transmitted according to the present invention illustratively include images video holograms digital instrument output and numerical streams.

The present invention includes a system for the transmission and reconstruction of a data set through the employ of a quantum Fourier transform QFT operation on qubits coding the data set.

The system of the present invention prepares a wave function in a quantum state representing the amplitudes of a given data set. G. L. Long Y. Sun 64 014303 2001 . A series of optical elements are provided to act as quantum operators followed by a measurement to implement the quantum Fourier transform. R. B. Griffiths C. S. Niu 76 3328 3231 1996 . While an optical bench is preferred as the platform for generating and performing operations on qubits it is appreciated that three plus qubit quantum computers are known to the art based on ion trapping and the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer.

An inventive quantum computing system has been developed for data processing. The data set amplitudes such as sound amplitudes are represented by a quantum wave function. The wave function is in turn coded into the qubits of quantum particles. Preferably the quantum particles are photons but trapped ions or magnetic spin states are also operative herein.

In the practice of the present invention on a classical computer the data series that for illustrative purposes is a sound is broken into a series of segments each represented by the number of qubits that the classical computer can store and compute. In a quantum computer the quantum particles preferably photons are operated on by optical components to perform the inventive method steps.

The method of the present invention relies on the use of qubits in a quantum computer or the simulation of qubits in a classical computer. Qubits are superpositions of ones and zeros where both simultaneously exist. Photons that define the wave function are subjected to a quantum Fourier transform operation. In the process the photons are measured thereby destroying the quantum state but providing the measured probability in terms of the wave function and its complex conjugate P 1 

An inverse Fourier transform FT is then applied to the square root of the measured probability to recover a lossy intelligible data compression in the form of quantum particle detection. It is appreciated that the inverse Fourier transform is either a classical or quantum transform. A classical fast Fourier transform is readily performed by optical bench elements or through a classical computer program. The forward and inverse transforms are conducted using a relatively small sample of the wave function Fourier modes which has the property of preserving much of the intelligibility of the data while providing a compression and communication efficiency. Using the quantum computing simulation of a classical computer according to the present invention a sound data set is intelligibly reproduced with a lossy compression factor over a classical computation. Computational efficiency with the present invention increases in the case of an increasing set of qubits. In practice the inventive method allows for the transmission of information over a long path using a small number of photons. Data transmission with a small number of photons carrying the data in a quantum particle form is amenable to free optical path transmission through air or vacuum through optical fibers and via satellite transmission. As a result a first location remote from a second location is retained in communication therebetween with the transmission of a comparatively small number of qubits of quantum particles relative to the data exchanged. Photons are amenable to transit in an environment exposed to climactic weather between the locations. It is appreciated that co linear transmission of a comparator wave function state and an information carrying state facilitates long range data transmission.

According to the present invention a data set is modeled by or in the form of a wave function. By way of example a sound is characterized by intensity amplitudes at uniformly spaced intervals 2 where

A superimposed quantum form is applied to the sound data set to facilitate quantum computer manipulation. To accomplish the quantification data amplitudes are equated to a wave function in the form of a series

To account for the quantum superposition the quantum data is organized in terms of a conventional quantum binary tree. A prior art quantum binary tree is depicted as a branching between 0 and 1 outcomes for successive steps in . The outcomes of the successive steps sum to the values 0 through 2 1 where n is the number of qubits. The means of obtaining the 0 or 1 depends on the specific experimental and corresponding simulation implementation. There are several conventional rules that are possible for determining the 0 or 1 value. For example a 0 state may correspond to a horizontal measurement and the 1 may correspond to a vertical measurement or the reverse may be true. In general the series of qubit measurements are prepared such that each value of the state preparation is conditioned to determine the 0 or 1 at each branch. An alternate qubit architecture operative herein is termed winner take all. In the simulation depicted in n qubit measurements are made. The n value is determinative of the first branch. The 2are divided into two parts lower 0 to 2 2 1 and higher indices 2 2 to 2 1. The side with the greatest sum of the indices measured determines the path of the first branch. The second level branch has one half the number of indices of the first branch. Consecutive indices assigned are from the selected half from the first branch. The same process is used for the second branch level as from the first branch but with half of the indices. This process repeats until all the branching is determined and the selected single index is determined. The quantum binary tree depicted in prior art for three qubits provides an index space of eight. The quantum binary tree is expandable to n qubits which is equivalent to an index space of 2over which transforms such as the QFT operate.

The quantum superposition amplitudes at any qubit level in the binary tree are constructed from sound amplitudes

Superpositions of qubits are used to store and process data such as sound. The amplitude of the data can be stored as the amplitudes of a superposed quantum state . 15 where kis the eigenstate of . The term can be decomposed as a direct product of qubits q q . . . q 16 which compacts storage requirements by a factor of log 2 relative to a classical computation. A data set of size 2can be stored and operated on in n quantum bits. Mathematical transforms can also be performed on the quantum stored signal with the associated computational savings.

According to the present invention data compression and transmission are preferably performed using photons as quantum particle qubits. Various system configurations are depicted in accompanying where like numerals described with reference to subsequent figures correspond to previously detailed elements.

Referring now to an inventive system is depicted generally at . A data encoder converts the data set to a set of photonic qubits that satisfies the expression of Equation 15 and triggers a light source accordingly. Preferably the light source is a laser. Exemplary lasers operative herein illustratively include Nd YAG ion lasers diode lasers excimer lasers dye lasers and frequency modified lasers. Photons emitted from the light source are optionally passed through a spatial filter . Filter converts the photons in an image space domain to a spatial frequency domain and serves the purpose of removing for example stripe noise of low frequency and or high frequency noise. The noise associated with system fluctuations illustratively including line noise powering the light source thermal gradients detector noise and inherent quantum noise. The photons having passed through spatial filter are then passed through a Type II nonlinear optics crystal . Type II nonlinear optic crystals are well known to the art and illustratively include potassium dihydrogen phosphate potassium titanyl phosphate beta barium borate cesium lithium borate and adamantyl amino nitro pyridine. A dichroic mirror is used to selectively reflect out of the beam path those photons that have changed wavelength as a result of passing through the crystal . A beam stop blocks the path of photons . The entangled photons are split by interaction with a polarization beam splitter . The entangled photons are split into a known photon state and a comparator wave function state . The comparator wave function state is directed onto a single photon counting module by an optional mirror set . It is appreciated that a reorganization of beam paths in the system obviates the need for mirror set . The detection of the comparator wave function state by the single photon counting module is fed to coincidence electronics and is used to reconstruct the data set. The known photon state is then passed through a polarization modulator and a phase modulator . Exemplary polarization phase modulators illustratively include liquid crystals Kerr cells and Pockel cells. Preferably a series of two liquid crystal devices and a quarter wave plate are used to achieve arbitrary polarization. Upon the known photon state interacting with the polarization and phase modulators and respectively the known photon state is transformed into an arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state based on the data set signal being transformed and any previously measured photon state if any is known. The arbitrarily oriented elliptical polarization state is optionally reflected from a mirror and then enters a polarization interferometer depicted generally at . The interferometer depicted has the geometry of a polarization Mach Zehnder interferometer and includes a polarization beam splitter that transmits one portion to a phase modulator resulting in a phase shift in the light component reaching polarization beam splitter relative to the other polarization component . Polarization beam splitter recombines beam components and to complete a controlled phase shift transform on the recombined state from the interferometer . Ancillary mirrors collectively numbered are provided to reflect light in desired directions. The controlled phase shift transformed light component representing a recombined phase state then interacts with a half wave plate oriented at 22.5 degrees in order to implement a quantum Hadamard gate transformation therein and thus complete a quantum Fourier transform. The half wave plate provides a qubit prioritized input to a polarization beam splitter .

In the QFT a number of photons each with prepared qubit states are sent sequentially through quantum controlled phase transforms followed by quantum Hadamard transforms. The state preparation is accomplished by setting the values of the phase and setting the photons to particular elliptical polarization values.

The Hadamard transform is a quantum transform operating on one qubit at a time. The Hadamard gate transform is given as

The initial state of each photon qubit is conditioned on the measured values of each photon that went before.

A single photon is operated upon by a Hadamard transform with the effect of Hadamard transforms on multiple photons representing an entire wave function is represented by the combined Hadamard transform.

The total wave function made of arbitrary superposed states is operated on by the combined Hadamard transform 19 where HI . . . I. 20 Here the direct product of the identities is repeated until all of the qubits are taken into account.

Single photon counting modules and count individual photons with a given polarization and report a counting event to coincidence electronics . Only when coincidence is noted between a photon counting event at module and or between module and module is the count considered a valid probability density function measurement. The probability density function is defined by P 21 and sets the number of times on the average that a photon lands in an indexed space interval. For n qubits there are 2indexed space intervals.

A determination as to the polarization of each photon is provided by signal measurement at one of the single photon counting modules and . The polarization of each photon is measured at the end of the photon path through the Hadamard gate and electro optics. If horizontal 0 then no phase operations applies to the remaining qubits. Otherwise a controlled phase operation Ris applied to remaining operations. The Rset is defined as

The term n represents the distance between the nindices of the binary tree levels under consideration 23 

The output of an inventive system is provided to a buffer store. From the buffer store it may be provided to an output device on either a real time or delayed basis as still images video images movies audio sound representations and the like.
