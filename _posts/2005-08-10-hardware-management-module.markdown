Modular platform systems are typically used in areas where reliability is increased and cost reduced by the use of interoperable pieces or hardware. Such interoperable hardware may include modular platform shelves or chasses. These modular platform shelves include one or more backplanes that receive and couple to other interoperable hardware such as circuit boards or boards . These boards may include but are not limited to blades carrier boards processing boards interconnects etc. Other interoperable hardware that a backplane may receive and couple to include components such as fans power equipment modules PEM field replaceable units FRUs alarm boards etc.

Generally modular platform system architectures require a set of manageability features in order to manage interoperable hardware in a modular platform shelf. Manageability features may include for example negotiating power budgets between boards and or components monitoring and controlling cooling hot swap management sequencing power up and power down processes alerting on errors and other capabilities that may be related to security.

Dedicated hardware solutions exist to perform most of the hardware manageability features or functions on interoperable hardware. One solution has each modular platform shelf implement a set of mandatory shelf manageability features as described for example in an industry standard known as the PCI Industrial Computer Manufacturers Group PICMG Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture ATCA Base Specification PICMG 3.0 Rev. 1.0 published Dec. 30 2002 and or later versions of the specification the ATCA specification . Thus for example in an ATCA modular platform system or rack that includes a plurality of modular platform shelves or chasses each shelf in the system may include one or more dedicated hardware management modules. Each hardware management module may reside on a board coupled to a backplane within each modular platform shelf to implement the set of mandatory hardware management functions.

As mentioned in the background modular platform systems are typically used in areas where reliability is increased and cost reduced by the use of interoperable hardware. However using dedicated hardware resources at each modular platform shelf to perform most hardware management functions may add substantially to the cost of operating and maintaining a modular platform system. Although industry standards such as ATCA dictate the management functions that are to be performed on each shelf the way these functions are implemented may vary. As a result the various hardware implementations may create interoperability issues and thus reduce the reliability of these types of modular platform systems. Consequently the use of dedicated hardware resources at each modular platform shelf may negatively impact the cost effectiveness and reliability of a modular platform system.

In one example network may be a network accessible only by modular platform shelves and via the communication links depicted in . In another example network may also be accessible to elements remote to modular platform system . This remote access for example may be via network coupling to wired and or wireless local area networks LANs metropolitan area networks MANs wide area networks WANs or the like.

In one implementation modular platform shelves and each include one or more board interfaces resident on a backplane within a modular platform shelf. These board interfaces for example may receive and couple a board to the backplane. depicts the modular platform shelves having boards received and coupled to these interfaces. For example modular platform shelf includes boards modular platform shelf includes boards and modular platform shelf includes boards . Although this disclosure is not limited to the number of boards and or board interfaces depicted in . Modular platform shelves and may also include one or more component interfaces not shown that may receive and couple a component e.g. PEM FRU fan alarm board etc. to a backplane within these modular platform shelves.

In one implementation modular platform shelf includes boards that support one or more hardware management modules e.g. hardware management modules . Hardware management modules for example may perform hardware management for all modular platform shelves in modular platform system . This hardware management may include but is not limited to monitoring board interfaces resident on backplanes within modular platform shelfs detecting when a board is received and coupled to a board interface and performing one or more management functions on the board. These hardware management functions are described in greater detail below when describing .

In one example hardware management modules and reside on boards and respectively. These boards may be in communication via backplane with one or more boards coupled to network communication links. For example depicts communication links and coupled to boards and respectively. As a result management modules and may couple to network via these boards. Boards may be for example switch boards that facilitate the routing of data and or instructions between modular platform shelf and elements within modular platform system or to elements remotely located outside of modular platform system .

In another example hardware management modules couple to network directly through backplane . For this example communication link couples to a management bus within backplane . This management bus may couple directly to hardware management module . As a result communication link may serve as a direct link to network for hardware management module 

In one example modular platform shelves and include one or more network enabled shelf management controllers NShMCs that are network enabled by coupling to and or being resident on a switch board coupled to network . Boards in shelf and boards may be boards coupled to network via communication links as depicted in . also depicts these boards as including resident NShMCs and These NShMCs may also couple to network via communication links and through backplanes and respectfully.

In one implementation NShMCs facilitate the management of boards received and coupled to board interfaces resident on a given backplane in modular platform system . Hardware management modules and may communicate through network to NShMCs located on modular platform shelves and . This communication may facilitate the monitoring of board interfaces resident on backplanes and by hardware management modules and . As a result these hardware management modules may detect via one or more NShMCs when a board is received and coupled to a board interface on backplanes and and then perform one or more management functions.

In one implementation modular platform system may be operated in compliance with the ATCA specification although this disclosure is not limited to ATCA compliant modular platform systems. In this implementation communication links and may be part of a base fabric located within backplanes and respectively. This base fabric may use 10 100 1000 BASE T Ethernet communication protocols Ethernet to forward data and or instructions between network and the modular platform shelves containing these backplanes. Ethernet associated communication protocols for example as described in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE standard 802.3 2002 IEEE Standard for Information technology Telecommunications and information exchange between systems Local and metropolitan area networks Specific requirements Part 3 Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection CSMA CD Access Method and Physical Layer Specifications published August 2002 and or later versions of the standard the Ethernet standard .

In another implementation communication links and may couple to a management bus located within backplanes and . One example of a management bus is described in the ATCA specification as an Intelligent Platform Management Bus IPMB . According to the ATCA specification an IPMB may be capable of providing out of band communication between boards and or other components received and coupled to a modular platform shelf or a backplane within a modular platform shelf e.g. backplane . This out of band communication may facilitate the management of boards and or components received and coupled to a backplane. An ATCA IPMB complies and or is compatible with the Intelligent Platform Management Bus Communications Protocol Specification Document Revision 1.0 published Nov. 15 1999 and or later versions of the standard the IPMB standard . Additionally an example communication protocol that may be used when communicating via an IPMB is described in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface IPMI Standard detailed in Intelligent Platform Management Interface Specification Second Generation Document Revision 1.0 dated Feb. 12 2004 published by Intel Hewlett Packard NEC and Dell and or later versions of the standard the IPMI standard . In other examples out of band communication is achieved for non ATCA modular platforms via a management bus such as a multi drop serial bus.

In one example hardware management module and or may forward data and or instructions destined for NShMCs in modular platform shelves and . The data and or instructions may be routed first over a management bus in backplane to communication link coupled to network . Network may contain a switch not shown to facilitate this routing of data and or instructions over communication links coupled to management buses within each backplane in modular platform system .

Hardware management module may be implemented as one or more of an application specific integrated circuit ASIC special function controller or processor field programmable gate array FPGA other hardware device and firmware or software to perform at least the functions described in this disclosure.

In one example board may be an ATCA compliant board where communication channels include a board management bus not shown that couples to a management bus in backplane . In this example board management controller may be an ATCA Intelligent Platform Management Controller IPMC and management bus an IPMB for an ATCA complaint modular platform shelf . In addition communication channels may include communication links to a base fabric not shown in backplane that may use Ethernet communication protocols to forward data and or instructions to network for example via communication links or coupled to boards or

Hardware manager module may include a predefined and or user definable set of manageability functions. To that end hardware management module may be capable of implementing one or more management policies as may be defined by a user which may be operable to determine which components of modular platform system may provide hardware management functionality to boards and or components within modular platform system . For example hardware management module may include one or more management policies within a memory e.g. memory responsive to and or accessible by hardware management module . A management policy may be in the form of a table in the memory. These policies may dictate which hardware management module in modular platform system is an active or master and which hardware management module is the standby or backup hardware management module for modular platform system .

In one implementation hardware management module includes management policies which indicate it is the active hardware management module of modular platform system . In addition hardware management module in board may include management policies which may indicate it is the standby hardware management module. In one example hardware management module transmits heartbeats to network e.g. through communication channels backplane and communication links or . These heartbeats may be in the form of data packets transmitted using various communication protocols e.g. IPMI Ethernet . Hardware management module may monitor these heartbeats e.g. receiving and reading heartbeat data packets via communication links in backplane and its management policies may include instructions to dynamically e.g. during run time take over the role of the active hardware management module if the heartbeats are delayed or can t be detected.

In one example one or more NShMCs in a modular platform system also include management policies e.g. in a memory responsive to and or accessible to an NShMC that enable a recognition of what hardware management modules are active e.g. through network broadcasts . For example NShMC monitors network for network broadcasts e.g. data packets transmitted via communication links or that may indicate that hardware management module is the active hardware management module and that hardware management module is the standby hardware management module.

In one example NShMC monitors the heartbeats of hardware management module and or . In this example NShMC s management policies may include instructions to dynamically take over the role of the active hardware management module if the is monitored heartbeats are delayed or can t be detected.

In one implementation each board may include a board management controller similar to that described for board . Board management controller may forward data and or instructions between boards and or components coupled to management bus . For example board may forward data and or instructions to board . These instructions for example may include management and or control instructions received either remotely e.g. from hardware management module or received from another board coupled to backplane .

In one example modular platform shelf may also include a PEM capable of providing power to modular platform shelf a fan to provide cooling of modular platform shelf an alarm board to provide visual notifications of fault conditions in modular platform shelf and a FRU . FRU for example may be a component to provide additional functionality to shelf e.g. additional input output connections memory storage or power . As depicted in these components may be coupled to management bus .

In one example modular platform shelf operates in compliance with the ATCA specification. In that regard management bus may be an Intelligent Platform Management Bus fPMB and board management controller may be an IPMC. However this disclosure is not limited to ATCA compliant modular platform systems.

Although not shown in the modular platform shelf may also include other communication links using out of band management and or control communication protocols for example serial communication protocols e.g. Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter UART and or other communication protocols.

In one implementation modular platform shelf also includes one or more NShMCs for example NShMC on board and NShMC on board . NShMC for example may facilitate hardware management module s hardware management of boards and or components received and coupled to modular platform shelf . NShMC may be implemented in software or firmware or a combination of both.

Although NShMC is shown in as residing on board and NShMC is shown as residing on board it is equally contemplated that NShMCs may reside on other boards and or other components of modular platform shelf . For example one or more NShMCs may alternatively reside in one or more integrated circuits field programmable gate arrays FPGA control logic or processors residing on or responsive to any other board and or component received and coupled to backplane .

In one embodiment NShMC may facilitate hardware management module by monitoring board and or component interfaces on backplane via management bus . NShMC may be capable of detecting when a board and or component couples to backplane e.g. by monitoring interface impedance levels . Thus NShMC may facilitate hardware management module s performance of one or more shelf management functions.

In one example as mentioned previously NShMC may be network enabled. For example a network interface resident on boards and may enable NShMC to couple to network via communication link and to forward data and or instructions from other boards modules or components coupled to network e.g. hardware management module . This network interface may comply for example with Ethernet associated communication protocols and or other network communication protocols.

In one example modular platform shelf operates in compliance with the ATCA specification. As mentioned above in one example communication links may be part of a base fabric located within backplanes and may use Ethernet communication protocols to forward data and or instructions to network . In this example NShMC communicates with hardware management module via communication link coupled to the base fabric in backplane . NShMC may include a base fabric interface not shown to translate or bridge any Ethernet related communication protocols. This bridging for example may enable NShMC to bridge Ethernet communications received from hardware management module to IPMI protocols. These IPMI protocols may then be used to forward data and or instructions to facilitate the management of boards and or components coupled to management bus in backplane .

In one example boards and or modules e.g. hardware management module in an ATCA compliant modular platform system e.g. modular platform system are capable of communicating IPMI messages over communication link to NShMC . For example hardware management module or connects with NShMC over a Remote Management Control Protocol RMCP session to send IPMI messages directed at the NShMC and or other boards received and coupled to backplane . For an RMCP defined session the NShMC may include an interface to perform all of the RMCP defined session management functionalities discover messages that may require the NShMC to facilitate or perform one or more hardware management functions performed by the hardware management module and or decide if the IPMI message needs to be forwarded to NShMCs on other boards. If forwarded for example these NShMCs may also facilitate and or perform at least a portion of the one or more management functions.

In one example interface includes instructions capable of interfacing hardware management module to board management controller . Interface may also permit hardware management module to exchange data and or instructions with one or more components and or boards coupled to modular platform shelf via management bus . Interface may also provide a communication path for one or more other board management controllers e.g. on boards and or other components e.g. PEMs fans FRUs alarm boards etc. within modular platform system . As a result interface may be operable to communicate requests and information to the hardware management module for management and or control of modular platform system . Interface may include a UART type interface block transfer BT interface a KCS keyboard controller style interface and or other interfaces.

In one implementation an NShMC interface is capable of providing an interface between the hardware management module and one or more NShMCs within modular platform system . NShMC interface may be capable of exchanging data and information using communications protocols that comply or are compatible with those used by the NShMCs over communication links in modular platform system e.g. Ethernet over communication links or IPMI and RMCP over communication link .

In one example a local area network LAN interface is provided. LAN interface is capable of communicating messages over LAN communication protocols. For example management clients can connect with the hardware management module over an RMCP session to send messages directed at the hardware management module e.g. through a base fabric communication link or to be bridged over to a management bus on the backplane e.g. management bus in backplane . For an RMCP defined session the LAN interface may perform all of the RMCP defined session management functionalities discover messages that may be forwarded to hardware management layers capable of processing requests and or decide if the message needs to be bridged over to communication protocols used on management bus e.g. IPMI .

Other specialized interfaces may also be utilized. For example since the hardware management module may be deployed on different hardware configurations i.e. in different components on board one such configuration could be a dedicated hardware management configuration. In this case the specialized interface may be provided through a specific hardware driver that provides connectivity to the management bus and may also provide an interface to the Interface Abstraction Layer . This driver may provide the same functionality as provided by a KCS driver which may provide consistent functionality across multiple hardware interface drivers by abstracting out specifics of hardware interaction.

In one implementation the interface abstraction layer provides a programming interface to the hardware management module regardless of the type of hardware or software interface coupled to the interface abstraction layer and exchanges commands and data with one or more different interfaces . As a result the interface abstraction layer may allow the hardware management module to reside on any hardware and may operate to abstract out the underlying hardware interface used to obtain access to management bus and board controller . Hence while providing flexible interaction with different hardware interfaces to perform management functions interface abstraction layer may permit other functionalities of the hardware management architecture . The interface abstraction layer may also provide message formatting message tracking and response matching for requests.

The interface abstraction layer may also perform additional functions. For example interface abstraction layer determines if a request needs to be formatted as a local request to board management controller or as a message that needs to be bridged by the board management controller over to management bus . Interface layer may also include application programming interfaces APIs to provide integration of a plurality of different hardware interfaces into the hardware management module . It should be noted that since the architecture may provide a flexible and scalable framework the same model can be extended to provide manageability functions for different hardware platforms beyond modular platform systems.

In one implementation the hardware management abstraction layer provides an interface layer for the instrumentation stack . The hardware management abstraction layer may provide an abstraction through an API that may be capable of communicating with instrumentation stack which can either reside on a memory e.g. memory or on a remote computing resource. This mechanism permits for example a relatively small bandwidth board controller and or mezzanine card and or processor to provide a subset of hardware management functionality while the rest of the instrumentation resides on a network management system e.g. coupled to network . The instrumentation stack may provide health tracking of each board correlation of errors and or other capabilities.

In one example the hardware management abstraction layer provides a programming interface to the instrumentation stack . Having a programming interface at the hardware management abstraction layer may allow the hardware management module to reside on any hardware entity in communication with this programming interface. Thus hardware management module may interact with the instrumentation stack regardless of where the hardware management module resides.

In one implementation the hardware management module may be implemented on a board such as a processing blade but the instrumentation stack resides on another board. Alternatively hardware management module may reside on a dedicated processor e.g. a service processor on a board and the instrumentation stack resides on another processor e.g. a host processor of the same board.

In one example the instrumentation stack layer capable of communicating with one or more interfaces such as a command line interface CLI simple network management protocol SNMP interface customer information model CIM interface and hyper text transfer protocol HTTP and others interface . The instrumentation stack may also provide a programming interface and a proprietary interface may also be implemented that may be used in a particular operating environment and or may be selectively enabled remotely as a service that may be purchased for a certain period of time.

In one implementation hardware management architecture is implemented within the components illustrated in . In other implementations hardware management architecture is implemented within NShMCs as illustrated in . In yet other implementations hardware management architecture is implemented remotely by network management systems coupled to modular platform system through network .

In one example an initialization function is performed by IPMCs e.g. board controller on ATCA compliant boards received and coupled to modular platform system . These IPMCs may initialize themselves and or receive commands to initialize from other boards or components e.g. via a management bus or network . This initialization may enable the IPMC to obtain policy data to indicate if the board is to perform hardware management for the modular platform shelf and or at least portions of the modular platform system. If the board is instructed by way of policy data to perform hardware management the policy data may also indicate which component s on the board which includes and or support a hardware management module e.g. processor IPMC mezzanine card chipset controller .

In one implementation a processor e.g. processor is designated to provide hardware management. The IPMC in this implementation may be capable of providing instructions to one or more boards in modular platform system that may require remote access e.g. through network . Once initialized the processor that is designated to provide hardware management as may be indicated in policy data setting may begin hardware management functions to the boards and or components in modular platform system . This initialization process may permit boards that boot off a network to communicate with remote storage devices to obtain access to their operating system images from the network.

Communication with such remote storage devices may comply or be compatible with an Ethernet or Internet Protocol IP and or other communication protocols.

In one example boards and or components received and coupled to interfaces on modular platform system contains information or data that characterizes various configuration parameters. This information in one example is referred to by the ATCA specification as FRU information. In one implementation the initialization function may enable the hardware management module to detect one or more boards and or components containing FRU information. This FRU information may include information to be used for power sequencing power budgeting addressing and determining interface or slot descriptions. This FRU information may be accessible over an IPMB in a backplane within a modular platform shelf.

In one ATCA implementation FRU information management function may scan for IPMI enabled boards and or components at known IPMB address ranges using the GetDeviceID IPMI command or the BroadcastGetDeviceID IPMI command. On successful discovery of IPMI enabled boards and or components at a given IPMB address a response to a GetAddresslnfo IPMI command may indicate if the board and or component provides FRU information. On discovery of FRU information FRU information management function may read the FRU information from this board and or component. This FRU information may include a power description record that describes the power needs of the board and or component. Hardware management module may use this information to manage power budgets within a modular platform shelf and or the modular platform system.

In one implementation additional FRU information from the board and or component may include backplane point to point interface descriptor records. These descriptor records may describe connectivity requirements for the board and or component. This information may be used for fabric compatibility functionality described below .

Hot swap management functionality may also be provided by the hardware management module . In one example hot swap management functionality enables hardware management module to manage the hot swap process of one or more boards and or components in an ATCA modular platform shelf and or system. Boards and or components can be received and coupled to an interface resident on a backplane or request for extraction at any point in time. In one implementation this may include communication of various hot swap states to hardware management module . This communication may occur over a management bus IPMB within a backplane and then onto network via communication links or or or a combination of these communication links.

In one implementation a hot swap state machine not shown as described in the ATCA specification may be used for state transitions and communicating the hot swap states between a hardware management module and the boards and or components in modular platform system . This state machine may govern the process of insertion extraction activation de activation and surprise extraction of boards and or components.

In one example power management functionality is also provided by the hardware management module . Power management functionality may include determining a total amount of power available to boards and or components for modular platform system and monitoring power consumption of at least one of the boards and or components. Power management functionality may also include adjusting power consumption of at least one of the boards and or components. For example if the power consumption of the board and or component rises above certain power consumption thresholds power management functionality reduces the power to that board and or component.

In one implementation power management functionality may make a determination of the power available on a given modular platform shelf and or the entire modular platform system. Power management functionality may then assign a power budget to one or more boards and or components and maintain the power budget assignment at the modular platform shelf or system level.

In one example FRU information related to one or more boards and or components provide information on the total power available the number of power feeds available and which boards and or components are powered by these feeds. This information may be used by power management functionality to determine if there is enough power available in a given modular platform shelf and or modular platform system. Power management functionality based on this determination may then enable each board or component received and coupled to a backplane within the modular platform system.

In one example fabric compatibility functionality is also provided by hardware management module . Fabric compatibility functionality may determine signaling compatibility between boards received and coupled to interfaces on a backplane. This may include determining the signaling types Ethernet Infiniband Fiber channel PCI Express Advanced Switching Rapid IO etc and enabling the boards to communicate if the boards have compatible signaling types.

In one example cooling management is also provided by hardware management module . Cooling management may ensure adequate cooling within each modular platform shelf and or an entire modular platform system. This may generally include monitoring a thermal condition of each of a plurality of boards and or components in the modular platform system and adjusting a cooling component e.g. fan in modular platform shelf in response to a thermal condition in excess of a thermal threshold level. For example under normal operating conditions every board and or component coupled to management bus in modular platform shelf sends thermal condition information through backplane to the hardware management module via network . Based at least in part on the thermal condition information cooling management functionality of hardware management module may take action to increase decrease cooling to modular platform shelf by sending IPMI commands to fan to increase decrease fan speeds.

In one example bus monitoring functionality is also provided by hardware management module . Bus monitoring may be utilized to determine if the management bus in a given backplane is functioning normally. Referring again to management bus of management bus may be divided into two segments. The first segment may be the part of management bus coming out of a board controller to the point where it enters backplane . The endpoint for this first segment may include a management bus isolator on a board not shown . This first segment may be called the board side management bus. The second segment may be the backplane side management bus. As per the ATCA specification an IPMC e.g. board controller on a board may be capable of determining the integrity of management bus on the board side while hardware management module may be capable of maintaining the integrity of the management bus on the backplane side. As such hardware management module may use functionality provided by the IPMC to execute one or more commands that determines the integrity of the management bus on both the first and second segments.

In block according to one implementation board management controller on board as depicted in receives e.g. via network or management bus or accesses e.g. in memory a management policy. In one example this policy is received or accessed upon board s coupling to a board interface on backplane . This policy may indicate to board management controller that board is to enable and or support a hardware management module e.g. hardware management module for modular platform system . This support may include supporting via a component resident on board that includes an ASIC FPGA service processor or the component is resident within another component such as processor chipset controller mezzanine card board management controller or resident within a combination or these components.

In block the policy may also indicate whether board s hardware management module is to be the active or standby hardware management module for modular platform system . If active in block board and or hardware management module may broadcast e.g. via management bus and or network it is the active hardware management module. The broadcast may be to other boards and or components coupled to backplanes in modular platform system . Board and or hardware management module may also broadcast a heartbeat e.g. via management bus and or network which indicates the health of board and or hardware management module . If standby the process moves to block .

In block a board that supports or has enabled a standby hardware management module e.g. board may monitor the heartbeats broadcast by board and or hardware management module . This broadcasted heartbeat may be at given time intervals as may be indicated in the management policy.

In block as long as a board supporting a standby hardware management module detects a heartbeat that board may continue to monitor for heartbeats. If a heartbeat is not detected or is delayed beyond a give threshold of time e.g. due to a failure or malfunction in board the board may then become the supporter of the active hardware management module and the process moves to block . In one example heartbeat monitoring criteria is included in the management policy.

In block hardware management module monitors board and or component interfaces resident on backplanes and . In one implementation hardware management module may communicate with one or more NShMCs within modular platform shelves and via the communication links depicted in . This communication may facilitate hardware management module s monitoring of these board and or component interfaces via the one or more NShMCs. The one or more NShMCs may be located within boards received and coupled to backplanes and . Additionally hardware management module may monitor board and or component interfaces on backplane via management bus . Alternatively hardware management module may monitor board and or component interfaces on backplane through one or more NShMCs within boards received and coupled to backplane .

In block for backplane and NShMCs may detect when a board and or component is received and coupled to a board interface on these backplanes. NShMCs for example may relay any detections to hardware management module . For backplane hardware management module may detect when a board and or component is received and coupled to that backplane.

In block hardware management module performs one or more management functions on the board and or component. The one or more management functions may include but are not limited to those management functions described above.

The process returns to block if hardware management module remains the active hardware management module.

The process starts over for example when hardware management module is notified that it is no longer the active hardware management module or if hardware management module becomes disabled and or is unable to send heartbeats. If so then another hardware management module becomes the active and the process either starts over at block if a standby hardware management module is not yet enabled or at block if a standby hardware management module is enabled.

Referring back to and memory . Memory may include a wide variety of memory media including but not limited to volatile memory non volatile memory flash programmable variables or states random access memory RAM read only memory ROM flash or other static or dynamic storage media.

In one example machine readable instructions can be provided to memory from a form of machine accessible medium. A machine accessible medium may represent any mechanism that provides i.e. stores and or transmits information in a form readable by a machine e.g. an ASIC special function controller or processor FPGA or other hardware device . For example a machine accessible medium may include ROM RAM magnetic disk storage media optical storage media flash memory devices electrical optical acoustical or other form of propagated signals e.g. carrier waves infrared signals digital signals and the like.

In the previous descriptions for the purpose of explanation numerous specific details were set forth in order to provide an understanding of this disclosure. It will be apparent that the disclosure can be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices were shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the disclosure.
