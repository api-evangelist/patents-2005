This application is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 10 855 877 filed May 28 2004 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety which is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 09 816 268 filed Mar. 23 2001 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to information storage and processing systems and more particularly relates to the management of supply chains using such systems.

Many types of manufacturing database management and inventory control systems exist today. Each of these systems views the process from the narrow viewpoint of the goals of such a system. For example inventory control processes tend to determine when the inventory of an item is projected to be depleted and when to order goods to prevent such depletion. The inventory control process does not generally take into account the problems associated with availability of materials and machines to satisfy the inventory demand. On the other hand the manufacturing control process considers the availability problem but does not take into account the effect of a sales promotion that will deplete an inventory faster than projected. A marketing department in preparing a sales promotion will often not consider the effect that promotion will have on availability inventory and profit margin but tends to focus on sales goals. What is needed is a system that will support managers with each of these view points in understanding the effect of the various decisions that can be made on the supply chain as a whole both currently and into the near future.

Supply chain information flows today are fragmented limited and in some cases non existent. The lack of timely communication between the different participants in the supply chain has resulted in higher costs for the system for example by limiting its ability to adequately measure distributor performance or to analyze promotion and new product activities e.g. sales success etc. In addition the system continues to suffer from excess inventories and waste unnecessary stock outs and rationing of products. A company cannot effectively react to these issues because the information that is needed to make sound management decisions is not available when it is needed.

From a marketing perspective this lack of information has significantly hampered a company s ability to evaluate marketing tactics post program. Such companies also do not possess historical data that can assist it in developing marketing strategy and related plans and understanding the essence of a brand.

Today there is limited access to and limited participation in supply chain information systems by restaurants franchisees distributors suppliers etc. The infrastructure for supply chain information systems is inadequate. Restaurant point of sale POS systems are diverse and do not allow for data flows and the resulting analysis. At any point in time it is not known how much product is selling when it is selling or where it is selling. As long as this situation is allowed to continue activities throughout the supply chain will continue to be reactive error prone time consuming and costly.

A system method and computer program product are disclosed for risk management in a supply chain management framework. A supply chain manager is appointed for at least one buying supply chain participant. Such appointment can be made arbitrarily by default upon selection by the supply chain participant etc. The supply chain manager is given authority to negotiate supply agreements for at least one good on behalf of the at least one buying supply chain participant. Note that the good may be a raw material and or a fully finished good as well. One or more supply agreements are entered into for the at least one good wherein provisions of the supply agreement include i pricing for each one good shall be based upon factors including an actual market price of at least one commodity when the supply chain manager has not established a commodity position price and ii pricing for each one good shall be based upon factors including a commodity position price of at least one commodity when the supply chain manager has established a commodity position price. Periodically a commodity position price is established through the supply chain manager so that the supply chain manager may thereby address risks to the supply chain of varying market levels and market volatility of the at least one goods.

In one aspect the supply chain manager is granted authority to negotiate supply agreements for the at least one good on behalf of all buying supply chain participants. In another aspect an actual market price of the at least one good is kept secret from the at least one buying supply chain participant. In a further aspect an identity of the at least one buying supply chain participant is kept secret from a supplier of the at least one good. In yet another aspect each supply agreement is between the supply chain manager on behalf of the at least one buying supply chain participant and a selling supply chain participant. In even a further aspect the good may be an at least partially finished good. In an additional aspect the determining may include the analyzing of data collected from a plurality of supply chain participants relating to the sale of goods.

The present invention allows participants in a supply chain for an enterprise or collection of enterprises to function as an integrated system. The Supply Chain model of the present invention is responsive and efficient based on electronic access to critical information that is available when it is needed at various points throughout the Supply Chain. As a result the Supply Chain is highly flexible reliable and user friendly responsive to consumer demands able to respond to short lead times and able to significantly lower Supply Chain costs.

The present invention positions a Brand for growth competition and profitability by installing and managing the infrastructure that facilitates accurate timely and relevant information flows throughout the Supply Chain.

The present invention overcomes traditional difficulties with supply chain information flows namely that the flow of information is fragmented untimely and or nonexistent. Further the present invention overcomes deficiencies in prior art supply chain information systems such as limited access limited participation and inadequate infrastructure which result in the unavailability of accurate timely management information from Supply Chain activities business decisions not being based on the best information unfavorable impact on the cost of products and error prone time consuming and costly activities throughout the Supply Chain.

Sales forecasting and inventory management are components in an embodiment of the Supply Chain management system. A theme of this model is transparent communication of current i.e. virtually real time and expected sales to some or all supply chain participants in a statistically meaningful distribution everyday for all inventory level products. In other words predictive supply chain behavior can be determined and analyzed. Of course the counterbalance here is the commitment to maintain the confidentiality of the particular data source franchisee.

Sales forecasting and analysis includes the accurate forecasting of menu items sales monitoring system performance against forecasts and communicating critical information to customers.

The sales forecasting and reporting subsystem allows Supply Chain management to develop maintain and communicate sales forecasts to supply chain constituents including for example 1 the franchisee community 2 the distribution community and 3 the supplier manufacturing community. Some benefits of this activity include 1 optimization of inventory levels throughout the supply chain 2 improved logistics management 3 improved production planning and 4 improved promotion planning including promotion marketing and execution. Further benefits include reduction in obsolete inventory cost reduction in lost sales due to shortages improved promotional decision making reduction in supply chain cost through improved inventory and capacity management and improved invoice averaging and revenue planning and reconciliation.

One aspect of the present invention provides an analytic model which enables a large and extended ecosystem comprised of many similar but otherwise independent operating units to quickly and inexpensively share near real time data with a trusted 3rd party from a selected and non disclosed sources in a highly granular format and then have extracted meaningful projections of future behavior for all of the other independent operating units so as to effect their purchase decisions. The combination of a confidential and very specific data b accumulated quickly and cheaply c shared to similar operating units d leading to predictive supply chain decisions for the benefit of manufactures suppliers distributors and operators is a major benefit provided by the present invention.

In an aspect the results of the comparison are fed back utilizing a network based interface. In another aspect the results of the comparison include a percent difference between the first set of data and the second set of data. In a further aspect the network includes the Internet. In one embodiment the aspect of the supply chain includes sales of goods. In another embodiment the aspect of the supply chain includes a demand of raw products required to produce the goods.

The sales forecasting and inventory management model is best described in the larger context of an integrated supply chain analysis model shown in . This is done to reflect the fact that there are multiple customers of this information with different requirements. Sales forecasting and inventory management can be viewed as separate but interdependent analytic activities due to the core competencies information and systems that are required to support each.

As shown in data such as menu item sales is collected in a database . An integrity check can be performed prior to storing the data in a database. Various types of analysis are performed on the data and reports are generated by Report Management and are sent to participants in the Supply Chain who may then distribute them to external customers. The analysis and reporting processes are described in more detail below.

In one aspect the planning may be communicated utilizing a network based interface. In another aspect the network may include the Internet. In a further aspect the promotion may be planned by coinciding a time frame of the promotion with a time frame reflected by the historical data. As a further aspect the promotion may be planned by coinciding a start time of the promotion with a start time reflected by the historical data. In an additional aspect the promotion may be planned by selecting an amount of ordered goods of the promotion based on an amount of ordered goods reflected by the historical data. In even another aspect an impact of the promotion on a promotional item may be forecasted. Additionally the impact of the promotion on a non promotional item may also be forecasted.

In one aspect the network includes the Internet. In another aspect the market trends are assessed via a network based interface. In a further aspect the market trends are assessed utilizing a graph. As a further aspect the graph may include dates as one coordinate.

In one aspect the all of the variables weather competitor activity and marketing calendar are utilized. In another aspect the information relating to the weather includes weather forecast. In a further aspect the information relating to the competitor activity includes a forecast of a promotion of a competitor. In an additional aspect the information relating to the marketing calendar includes a forecast of a promotion of the stores. In one aspect the network includes the Internet.

As part of the data needs analysis there are three different processes that address the issue of improving supply chain performance during promotional periods. These processes are 

While supplies last meaning that the promotion was active until each all of the product was depleted.

One objective of the sales forecasting and reporting system is to provide timely information to the supply chain allowing for production inventory and logistics planning reaction to deviations from plan as quickly as possible and or volume estimates in support of contracting processes.

According to an illustrative embodiment of the present invention a sales forecasting methodology is based on weekly menu item sales information. These sales forecast are all promotion centric which is appropriate for this example given that many businesses run promotions several weeks per year. The process begins with an analyst extracting appropriate comparative sales data based on the type of promotion. This data is formatted in a manner that allows analyst to observe the following data 

Based on this information the analyst makes a best guess of sales increases and cannibalization impacts. This menu item sales forecast is then translated into product requirements at the distributor and manufacturer supplier level and communicated to the system.

A preferred sales forecasting and reporting system provides weekly forecasts for management of product volumes during promotion periods. The forecast horizon in this example is 3 6 months and can be in terms of average weekly menu item sales with a particular focus on promotions and cannibalization.

In a food service supply chain for example historical menu item sales information is available by restaurant by day for geographically distributed restaurants. Exogenous variables should include promotion type GRP s for promotion any other concurrent promotional activities seasonality competitive environment and other factors that can be identified.

In an aspect the stores may include restaurants. In such an aspect the data in the first format may include daily totals. These daily totals may reflect a price associated with the goods. As a further aspect the data in the second format may include monthly totals. As another aspect the data in the second format may include a grouping of the goods.

Preferably data collection and reporting is in a format that allows for derivation of product requirements to support forecasted menu item sales i.e. how many boxes of hamburger patties are required based on menu item sales forecast . Actual sales are tracked against forecasted sales on a daily basis and alerts are generated if the deviation is significant. Sales forecasting accuracy reports and post promotion analysis are provided. The sales forecast can be in a form that allows for gross profit analysis to be developed.

Some benefits to retailer outlets from the collection and analysis of information include feedback of comparative and operation information including sales mix trends actual and or standard or ideal product cost actual and or standard or ideal gross margin and comparable information from participating retailers on this information.

Supply chain providers benefit by having access real time sales information. This drives efficiencies in two ways 1 Management of promotional volumes and inventories and 2 Management of on going production planning. Regarding promotional volumes and inventories supply chain providers are permitted to react faster by having sales information up to many weeks earlier than currently available. With respect to production planning by having real time sales information suppliers are able to maintain lower safety stocks improving capital efficiency.

Many of the benefits from Integrated Supply Chain Management are derived from the ability to deliver useful information for planning and operational purposes. The coordinator of the supply chain is given the information required to further optimize and decrease supply chain costs especially for promotion management and risk management.

In an aspect the total cost may be calculated by adding the first cost parameter and the second cost parameter. In another aspect the total cost may be displayed utilizing a network based interface. In a further aspect the data may be received from a plurality of distributors. In such an aspect the data may relate to goods required by a plurality of stores from the distributor. In one aspect the network may include a wide area network.

The sales and forecasting system can also provide longer term forecasts which supports contracting processes. The forecast horizon is variable based on contract needs such as 1 5 years. The forecast can be in terms of retailer average weekly item sales. System level forecasts can be extrapolated from average weekly item sales forecasts. Historical item sales information is made available by retailer by day. Some exogenous variables include store count comparable sales changes and changes in sales mix.

Preferably data collection and reporting is in a format that allows for derivation of product requirements to support forecasted item sales. Forecasts and reports can be distributed via the Internet in a fixed report format or Excel spreadsheet for example depending on the recipient of the information.

In an aspect the network may include the Internet. In another aspect the data may be checked for errors in real time. In a further aspect the identified errors may be logged. As an aspect the log may be transmitted to the point of sale outlets utilizing the network. As another aspect the log may be transmitted to a supply chain manager utilizing the network.

In an aspect the stores may include restaurants. In another aspect the past promotions may then be ranked. In a further aspect the comparison may be displayed utilizing a network based interface. In one aspect the time frame may include a start date and a finish date. In an additional aspect the data may include an amount of revenue associated with the sale of the goods.

To accomplish the forecasting and reporting objectives of the present invention some integration may be required between the supply chain coordinator and retail management. illustrates potential levels of integration between the supply chain coordinator and retail management . At the highest level the two are autonomous. The two may share their own forecasts or may collaborate to create forecasts. The ideal situation is one in which a separate business unit is supported by the two. This leverages resources eliminates bias joins forecasts and implications of results and provides for sharing of knowledge.

The primary element of forecasting is the communication of product movement throughout the system. Sales information can be received from suppliers and distribution centers monthly weekly daily etc. Preferably sales data from the POS by store is received daily as it provides much more information regarding specific menu items and promotional items.

The collection and dissemination of this data allow both the supply chain coordinator and the franchisee to benefit by sharing sales information and sales forecasting. The system also benefits from improved supply chain performance. Further benefits include providing franchisees with access to new reports on sales mix food cost and distributor performance and providing franchisees with a better understanding of menu sales mix on margins both in everyday situations as well as promotional situations. The supply chain coordinator suppliers and distributors have access to virtually real time sales allowing for improved management of inventory and improved sales forecasting. Margin management information improves the supply chain coordinator s decision making capability in the area of risk management and purchasing.

In an aspect the stores may include restaurants. In such an aspect the processed product may include food. In another aspect the first set of information may include an amount of the finished product. In a further aspect the second set of information may include an amount of the processed product. In one aspect the percentage may be made available utilizing a network based interface.

Historical daily menu item sales data on a per store basis is the preferred backbone for all decision making and expanding analysis. Other causal information variables that predict sales can be collected and married with the menu item sales data to more accurately forecast. These variables might include weather competitive information marketing calendar etc. Additional information such as menu item recipes can be used to further manipulate the data.

In a preferred embodiment daily menu item sales data is received from restaurants on a per restaurant basis. This information is used to support the sales forecasting function and is used to report sales volumes to distributors and suppliers manufacturers. Distributor level sales data is received on a weekly basis for all distributors while supplier level sales data is received on a weekly basis for suppliers of key products .

In order to best support real time supply chain management access to information on product flow at the point of sale is provided on a daily basis. A representative sample of daily menu item sales can be collected if collection of all the data is not desired because of cumbersomeness communications problems etc.

In one aspect the numeric goods identifier may include a global trade identification number GTIN . In another aspect the generated data and the numeric goods identifier may be communicated utilizing a network based interface. In a further aspect the numeric goods identifier may actually be positioned on the goods. In such an aspect the numeric goods identifier may be positioned on the goods in the form of a bar code. In another aspect the generated data may be tagged by including the numeric goods identifier therewith. In yet another aspect outlet information is communicated between the supply chain participants. Also order information can be synchronized between supply chain providers.

In an aspect the sampling may be representative of a predetermined percentage of the stores distributors and suppliers. In another aspect the statistics may represent sales of the stores. In a further aspect the statistics may represent goods ordered by the stores. In an additional aspect the statistics may represent a timeliness of delivery of the ordered goods by the distributors. In one aspect the statistics may represent an inventory of the suppliers.

In an aspect each location may include a store. In another aspect the calculating may include parsing the data based on location information and the promotion item and dividing the data by the duration information. In a further aspect the promotion items may include utensils. In yet another aspect the promotion items may include food. In one aspect the projected daily usage may be outputted via a network based interface. In even another aspect a projected daily usage of finished goods may also be calculated for the plurality of locations based on the data. Next the projections may be translated into a forecast of processed products required for the plurality of locations as well as into a forecast of delivery and storage parameters.

In one aspect the confirmation is received utilizing the network. In such an aspect the network may include the Internet. In another aspect the alert is transmitted to the stores utilizing the network. As an aspect the alert may be displayed on the network based interface. As a further aspect the alert may include an electronic mail message.

The Supply Chain management system of the present invention creates from its members a web community with like interests. As a result a number of different types of vendors may be interested in connecting to the site due to the captive audience comprising the web community and because the community is a highly targeted audience with similar business goals interests.

One area of revenue generation is collection of fees for advertising. Fees can be charged for such things as co branding local service and product providers national providers of optional items services distributor specials utilities etc.

Revenue can also be generated by charging a fee to participants who buy and sell though the site such as bakeries soft drink vendors coffee vendors equipment vendors consumers restaurants etc.

Sales and services can also be a source of revenue. Potential sources can be utilities office products computers and equipment. Providing an auction service can also create revenue.

A preferred embodiment of the present invention utilizes one or more of the following revenue models investment in web site charge per unit sold through site exposures or click through or a combination of these.

In an aspect the network includes the Internet. In another aspect the supply chain participant may be a supplier a distributor and or a store. In such an aspect the advertising advertises the sale of products required for the production of the goods produced by the stores. As another aspect the advertising may be conducted by at least one of the supply chain participants. In an additional aspect a charge may be required for the advertising.

In an aspect the network includes the Internet. In another aspect the supply chain participant may be a supplier a distributor and or a store. In such an aspect the advertising may advertise the sale of products required for the production of the goods produced by the stores. As another aspect the advertising may be conducted by one of the supply chain participants. In one aspect charge is required for the advertising.

In one aspect the network includes the Internet. In another aspect the user may be a supplier a distributor and or a store. In such an aspect the products may be required for the production of the goods produced by the stores. In such an aspect the advertising may be conducted by at least one of the users.

In an aspect the network includes the Internet. In one aspect the users include suppliers distributors and or stores. In another aspect advertising is displayed on the network based interface which advertises the sale of products required for the production of the goods produced by the store. As an aspect the advertising may be conducted by at least one of the users. As another aspect a charge is required for the advertising.

In one aspect the network includes the Internet. In another aspect the users may be a supplier a distributor and or a store. In a further aspect advertising is displayed on the network based interface which advertises the sale of products required for the production of the goods produced by the store. In such an aspect the advertising may be conducted by at least one of the users. As another aspect a charge may be required for the advertising.

In one aspect the supply chain manager is granted authority to negotiate purchase agreements for the at least one supply chain commodity on behalf of all buying supply chain participants. The commodity can be a raw material a partially finished good and or a finished good. In a further aspect the at least one purchase agreement establishes a contract price depending upon an actual market price for the commodity in circumstances where no determination of the effective price of the commodity has been made. In one aspect an actual market price of the commodity is kept secret from the at least one buying supply chain participant. In another aspect an identity of the at least one buying supply chain participant is kept secret from a supplier of the commodity.

One benefit of this embodiment of the present invention is that the supply chain manager may have greater information about market demand for various raw material commodities than a distributor and may wish to benefit from the availability of this information. By fixing an effective raw material price the supplier is free to either take the required position at no cost since the contract price will be based upon the effective price or take a contrary view with the associated risk and benefit.

An additional benefit of this system is that the supply chain manager may exploit raw material information without 1 disclosing confidential information beyond the fixed price analysis and 2 needing to include raw material suppliers immediately into the integrated supply chain models.

By controlling the invoice price the distributor does not know the contract price of the supplier. Another advantage provided is that the supply chain manager can direct supplier to buy raw materials at a particular price based on supply and demand information gathered by the supply chain management system.

In one aspect of the present invention the invoice price is collected from the buying supply chain participant s .

A representative hardware environment associated with the various components of is depicted in . In the present description the various sub components of each of the components may also be considered components of the system. For example particular software modules executed on any component of the system may also be considered components of the system. illustrates a typical hardware configuration of a workstation in accordance with one embodiment having a central processing unit such as a microprocessor and a number of other units interconnected via a system bus .

The workstation shown in includes a Random Access Memory RAM Read Only Memory ROM an I O adapter for connecting peripheral devices such as disk storage units to the bus a user interface adapter for connecting a keyboard a mouse a speaker a microphone and or other user interface devices such as a touch screen not shown to the bus communication adapter for connecting the workstation to a communication network e.g. a data processing network and a display adapter for connecting the bus to a display device .

An embodiment of the present invention may be written using traditional methodologies and programming languages such as C Pascal BASIC or Fortran or may be written using object oriented methodologies and object oriented programming languages such as Java C C Python or Smalltalk. Object oriented programming OOP has become increasingly used to develop complex applications. As OOP moves toward the mainstream of software design and development various software solutions require adaptation to make use of the benefits of OOP. A need exists for these principles of OOP to be applied to a messaging interface of an electronic messaging system such that a set of OOP classes and objects for the messaging interface can be provided.

OOP is a process of developing computer software using objects including the steps of analyzing the problem designing the system and constructing the program. An object is a software package that contains both data and a collection of related structures and procedures. Since it contains both data and a collection of structures and procedures it can be visualized as a self sufficient component that does not require other additional structures procedures or data to perform its specific task. OOP therefore views a computer program as a collection of largely autonomous components called objects each of which is responsible for a specific task. This concept of packaging data structures and procedures together in one component or module is called encapsulation.

In general OOP components are reusable software modules which present an interface that conforms to an object model and which are accessed at run time through a component integration architecture. A component integration architecture is a set of architecture mechanisms which allow software modules in different process spaces to utilize each others capabilities or functions. This is generally done by assuming a common component object model on which to build the architecture. It is worthwhile to differentiate between an object and a class of objects at this point. An object is a single instance of the class of objects which is often just called a class. A class of objects can be viewed as a blueprint from which many objects can be formed.

OOP allows the programmer to create an object that is a part of another object. For example the object representing a piston engine is said to have a composition relationship with the object representing a piston. In reality a piston engine comprises a piston valves and many other components the fact that a piston is an element of a piston engine can be logically and semantically represented in OOP by two objects.

OOP also allows creation of an object that depends from another object. If there are two objects one representing a piston engine and the other representing a piston engine wherein the piston is made of ceramic then the relationship between the two objects is not that of composition. A ceramic piston engine does not make up a piston engine. Rather it is merely one kind of piston engine that has one more limitation than the piston engine its piston is made of ceramic. In this case the object representing the ceramic piston engine is called a derived object and it inherits all of the aspects of the object representing the piston engine and adds further limitation or detail to it. The object representing the ceramic piston engine depends from the object representing the piston engine. The relationship between these objects is called inheritance.

When the object or class representing the ceramic piston engine inherits all of the aspects of the objects representing the piston engine it inherits the thermal characteristics of a standard piston defined in the piston engine class. However the ceramic piston engine object overrides these ceramic specific thermal characteristics which are typically different from those associated with a metal piston. It skips over the original and uses new functions related to ceramic pistons. Different kinds of piston engines have different characteristics but may have the same underlying functions associated with it e.g. how many pistons in the engine ignition sequences lubrication etc. . To access each of these functions in any piston engine object a programmer would call the same functions with the same names but each type of piston engine may have different overriding implementations of functions behind the same name. This ability to hide different implementations of a function behind the same name is called polymorphism and it greatly simplifies communication among objects.

With the concepts of composition relationship encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism an object can represent just about anything in the real world. In fact one s logical perception of the reality is the only limit on determining the kinds of things that can become objects in object oriented software. Some typical categories are as follows 

With this enormous capability of an object to represent just about any logically separable matters OOP allows the software developer to design and implement a computer program that is a model of some aspects of reality whether that reality is a physical entity a process a system or a composition of matter. Since the object can represent anything the software developer can create an object which can be used as a component in a larger software project in the future.

If 90 of a new OOP software program consists of proven existing components made from preexisting reusable objects then only the remaining 10 of the new software project has to be written and tested from scratch. Since 90 already came from an inventory of extensively tested reusable objects the potential domain from which an error could originate is 10 of the program. As a result OOP enables software developers to build objects out of other previously built objects.

This process closely resembles complex machinery being built out of assemblies and sub assemblies. OOP technology therefore makes software engineering more like hardware engineering in that software is built from existing components which are available to the developer as objects. All this adds up to an improved quality of the software as well as an increased speed of its development.

Programming languages are beginning to fully support the OOP principles such as encapsulation inheritance polymorphism and composition relationship. With the advent of the C language many commercial software developers have embraced OOP. C is an OOP language that offers a fast machine executable code. Furthermore C is suitable for both commercial application and systems programming projects. For now C appears to be the most popular choice among many OOP programmers but there is a host of other OOP languages such as Smalltalk Common Lisp Object System CLOS and Eiffel. Additionally OOP capabilities are being added to more traditional popular computer programming languages such as Pascal.

Class libraries are very flexible. As programs grow more complex more programmers are forced to reinvent basic solutions to basic problems over and over again. A relatively new extension of the class library concept is to have a framework of class libraries. This framework is more complex and consists of significant collections of collaborating classes that capture both the small scale patterns and major mechanisms that implement the common requirements and design in a specific application domain. They were first developed to free application programmers from the chores involved in displaying menus windows dialog boxes and other standard user interface elements for personal computers.

Frameworks also represent a change in the way programmers think about the interaction between the code they write and code written by others. In the early days of procedural programming the programmer called libraries provided by the operating system to perform certain tasks but basically the program executed down the page from start to finish and the programmer was solely responsible for the flow of control. This was appropriate for printing out paychecks calculating a mathematical table or solving other problems with a program that executed in just one way.

The development of graphical user interfaces began to turn this procedural programming arrangement inside out. These interfaces allow the user rather than program logic to drive the program and decide when certain actions should be performed. Today most personal computer software accomplishes this by means of an event loop which monitors the mouse keyboard and other sources of external events and calls the appropriate parts of the programmer s code according to actions that the user performs. The programmer no longer determines the order in which events occur. Instead a program is divided into separate pieces that are called at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order. By relinquishing control in this way to users the developer creates a program that is much easier to use. Nevertheless individual pieces of the program written by the developer still call libraries provided by the operating system to accomplish certain tasks and the programmer must still determine the flow of control within each piece after it s called by the event loop. Application code still sits on top of the system.

Even event loop programs require programmers to write a lot of code that should not need to be written separately for every application. The concept of an application framework carries the event loop concept further. Instead of dealing with all the nuts and bolts of constructing basic menus windows and dialog boxes and then making these things all work together programmers using application frameworks start with working application code and basic user interface elements in place. Subsequently they build from there by replacing some of the generic capabilities of the framework with the specific capabilities of the intended application.

Application frameworks reduce the total amount of code that a programmer has to write from scratch. However because the framework is really a generic application that displays windows supports copy and paste and so on the programmer can also relinquish control to a greater degree than event loop programs permit. The framework code takes care of almost all event handling and flow of control and the programmer s code is called only when the framework needs it e.g. to create or manipulate a proprietary data structure .

A programmer writing a framework program not only relinquishes control to the user as is also true for event loop programs but also relinquishes the detailed flow of control within the program to the framework. This approach allows the creation of more complex systems that work together in interesting ways as opposed to isolated programs having custom code being created over and over again for similar problems.

Thus as is explained above a framework basically is a collection of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design solution for a given problem domain. It typically includes objects that provide default behavior e.g. for menus and windows and programmers use it by inheriting some of that default behavior and overriding other behavior so that the framework calls application code at the appropriate times.

Thus through the development of frameworks for solutions to various problems and programming tasks significant reductions in the design and development effort for software can be achieved. A preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes HyperText Markup Language HTML to implement documents on the Internet together with a general purpose secure communication protocol for a transport medium between the client and the server. Information on these products is available in T. Berners Lee D. Connoly RFC 1866 Hypertext Markup Language 2.0 November 1995 and R. Fielding H Frystyk T. Berners Lee J. Gettys and J. C. Mogul Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP 1.1 HTTP Working Group Internet Draft May 2 1996 . HTML is a simple data format used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. SGML documents are documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains and are HTML compatible. HTML has been in use by the World Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879 1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML .

XML Extensible Markup Language is a flexible way to create common information formats and share both the format and the data on the World Wide Web intranets and elsewhere. For example computer makers might agree on a standard or common way to describe the information about a computer product processor speed memory size and so forth and then describe the product information format with XML. Such a standard way of describing data would enable a user to send an intelligent agent a program to each computer maker s Web site gather data and then make a valid comparison. XML can be used by any individual or group of individuals or companies that wants to share information in a consistent way.

XML a formal recommendation from the World Wide Web Consortium W3C is similar to the language of today s Web pages the Hypertext Markup Language HTML . Both XML and HTML contain markup symbols to describe the contents of a page or file. HTML however describes the content of a Web page mainly text and graphic images only in terms of how it is to be displayed and interacted with. For example the letter p placed within markup tags starts a new paragraph. XML describes the content in terms of what data is being described. For example the word phonenum placed within markup tags could indicate that the data that followed was a phone number. This means that an XML file can be processed purely as data by a program or it can be stored with similar data on another computer or like an HTML file that it can be displayed. For example depending on how the application in the receiving computer wanted to handle the phone number it could be stored displayed or dialed.

XML is extensible because unlike HTML the markup symbols are unlimited and self defining. XML is actually a simpler and easier to use subset of the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML the standard for how to create a document structure. It is expected that HTML and XML will be used together in many Web applications. XML markup for example may appear within an HTML page.

To date Web development tools have been limited in their ability to create dynamic Web applications which span from client to server and interoperate with existing computing resources. Until recently HTML has been the dominant technology used in development of Web based solutions. However HTML has proven to be inadequate in the following areas 

With Java developers can create robust User Interface UI components. Custom widgets e.g. real time stock tickers animated icons etc. can be created and client side performance is improved. Unlike HTML Java supports the notion of client side validation offloading appropriate processing onto the client for improved performance. Dynamic real time Web pages can be created. Using the above mentioned custom UI components dynamic Web pages can also be created.

Sun s Java language has emerged as an industry recognized language for programming the Internet. Sun defines Java as a simple object oriented distributed interpreted robust secure architecture neutral portable high performance multithreaded dynamic buzzword compliant general purpose programming language. Java supports programming for the Internet in the form of platform independent Java applets. Java applets are small specialized applications that comply with Sun s Java Application Programming Interface API allowing developers to add interactive content to Web documents e.g. simple animations page adornments basic games etc. . Applets execute within a Java compatible browser e.g. Netscape Navigator by copying code from the server to client. From a language standpoint Java s core feature set is based on C . Sun s Java literature states that Java is basically C with extensions from Objective C for more dynamic method resolution. 

Another technology that provides similar function to Java is provided by Microsoft and ActiveX Technologies to give developers and Web designers wherewithal to build dynamic content for the Internet and personal computers. ActiveX includes tools for developing animation 3 D virtual reality video and other multimedia content. The tools use Internet standards work on multiple platforms and are being supported by over 100 companies. The group s building blocks are called ActiveX Controls small fast components that enable developers to embed parts of software in hypertext markup language HTML pages. ActiveX Controls work with a variety of programming languages including Microsoft Visual C Borland Delphi Microsoft Visual Basic programming system and in the future Microsoft s development tool for Java code named Jakarta. ActiveX Technologies also includes ActiveX Server Framework allowing developers to create server applications. One of ordinary skill in the art readily recognizes that ActiveX could be substituted for Java without undue experimentation to practice the invention.

Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP is a basic communication language or protocol of the Internet. It can also be used as a communications protocol in the private networks called intranet and in extranet. When one is set up with direct access to the Internet his or her computer is provided with a copy of the TCP IP program just as every other computer that he or she may send messages to or get information from also has a copy of TCP IP.

TCP IP comprises a Transmission Control Protocol TCP layer and an Internet Protocol IP layer. TCP manages the assembling of series of packets from a message or file for transmission of packets over the internet from a source host to a destination host. IP handles the addressing of packets to provide for the delivery of each packet from the source host to the destination host. Host computers on a network receive packets analyze the addressing of the packet If the host computer is not the destination the host attempts to route the packet by forwarding it to another host that is closer in some sense to the packet s destination. While some packets may be routed differently through a series of interim host computers than others TCP and IP provides for the packets to be correctly reassembled at the ultimate destination.

TCP IP uses a client server model of communication in which a computer user a client requests and is provided a service such as sending a Web page by another computer a server in the network. TCP IP communication is primarily point to point meaning each communication is from one point or host computer in the network to another point or host computer. TCP IP and the higher level applications that use it are collectively said to be stateless because each client request is considered a new request unrelated to any previous one unlike ordinary phone conversations that require a dedicated connection for the call duration . Being stateless frees network paths so that everyone can use them continuously note that the TCP layer itself is not stateless as far as any one message is concerned. Its connection remains in place until all packets in a message have been received. .

Many Internet users are familiar with the even higher layer application protocols that use TCP IP to get to the Internet. These include the World Wide Web s Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP the File Transfer Protocol FTP Telnet which lets one logon to remote computers and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP . These and other protocols are often packaged together with TCP IP as a suite. 

Personal computer users usually get to the Internet through the Serial Line Internet Protocol SLIP or the Point to Point Protocol. These protocols encapsulate the IP packets so that they can be sent over a dial up phone connection to an access provider s modem.

Protocols related to TCP IP include the User Datagram Protocol UDP which is used instead of TCP for special purposes. Other protocols are used by network host computers for exchanging router information. These include the Internet Control Message Protocol ICMP the Interior Gateway Protocol IGP the Exterior Gateway Protocol EGP and the Border Gateway Protocol BGP .

Internetwork Packet Exchange IPX is a networking protocol from Novell that interconnects networks that use Novell s NetWare clients and servers. IPX is a datagram or packet protocol. IPX works at the network layer of communication protocols and is connectionless that is it doesn t require that a connection be maintained during an exchange of packets as for example a regular voice phone call does .

Packet acknowledgment is managed by another Novell protocol the Sequenced Packet Exchange SPX . Other related Novell NetWare protocols are the Routing Information Protocol RIP the Service Advertising Protocol SAP and the NetWare Link Services Protocol NLSP .

A virtual private network VPN is a private data network that makes use of the public telecommunication infrastructure maintaining privacy through the use of a tunneling protocol and security procedures. A virtual private network can be contrasted with a system of owned or leased lines that can only be used by one company. The idea of the VPN is to give the company the same capabilities at much lower cost by using the shared public infrastructure rather than a private one. Phone companies have provided secure shared resources for voice messages. A virtual private network makes it possible to have the same secure sharing of public resources for data.

Using a virtual private network involves encryption data before sending it through the public network and decrypting it at the receiving end. An additional level of security involves encrypting not only the data but also the originating and receiving network addresses. Microsoft 3Com and several other companies have developed the Point to Point Tunneling Protocol PPTP and Microsoft has extended Windows NT to support it. VPN software is typically installed as part of a company s firewall server.

Wireless refers to a communications monitoring or control system in which electromagnetic radiation spectrum or acoustic waves carry a signal through atmospheric space rather than along a wire. In most wireless systems radio frequency RF or infrared transmission IR waves are used. Some monitoring devices such as intrusion alarms employ acoustic waves at frequencies above the range of human hearing.

Early experimenters in electromagnetic physics dreamed of building a so called wireless telegraph. The first wireless telegraph transmitters went on the air in the early years of the 20th century. Later as amplitude modulation AM made it possible to transmit voices and music via wireless the medium came to be called radio. With the advent of television fax data communication and the effective use of a larger portion of the electromagnetic spectrum the original term has been brought to life again.

Common examples of wireless equipment in use today include the Global Positioning System cellular telephone phones and pagers cordless computer accessories for example the cordless mouse home entertainment system control boxes remote garage door openers two way radios and baby monitors. An increasing number of companies and organizations are using wireless LAN. Wireless transceivers are available for connection to portable and notebook computers allowing Internet access in selected cities without the need to locate a telephone jack. Eventually it will be possible to link any computer to the Internet via satellite no matter where in the world the computer might be located.

Bluetooth is a computing and telecommunications industry specification that describes how mobile phones computers and personal digital assistants PDA s can easily interconnect with each other and with home and business phones and computers using a short range wireless connection. Each device is equipped with a microchip transceiver that transmits and receives in a previously unused frequency band of 2.45 GHz that is available globally with some variation of bandwidth in different countries . In addition to data up to three voice channels are available. Each device has a unique 48 bit address from the IEEE 802 standard. Connections can be point to point or multipoint. The maximum range is 10 meters. Data can be presently be exchanged at a rate of 1 megabit per second up to 2 Mbps in the second generation of the technology . A frequency hop scheme allows devices to communicate even in areas with a great deal of electromagnetic interference. Built in encryption and verification is provided.

Encryption is the conversion of data into a form called a ciphertext that cannot be easily understood by unauthorized people. Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form so it can be understood.

The use of encryption decryption is as old as the art of communication. In wartime a cipher often incorrectly called a code can be employed to keep the enemy from obtaining the contents of transmissions technically a code is a means of representing a signal without the intent of keeping it secret examples are Morse code and ASCII . Simple ciphers include the substitution of letters for numbers the rotation of letters in the alphabet and the scrambling of voice signals by inverting the sideband frequencies. More complex ciphers work according to sophisticated computer algorithm that rearrange the data bits in digital signals.

In order to easily recover the contents of an encrypted signal the correct decryption key is required. The key is an algorithm that undoes the work of the encryption algorithm. Alternatively a computer can be used in an attempt to break the cipher. The more complex the encryption algorithm the more difficult it becomes to eavesdrop on the communications without access to the key.

Rivest Shamir Adleman RSA is an Internet encryption and authentication system that uses an algorithm developed in 1977 by Ron Rivest Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman. The RSA algorithm is a commonly used encryption and authentication algorithm and is included as part of the Web browser from Netscape and Microsoft. It s also part of Lotus Notes Intuit s Quicken and many other products. The encryption system is owned by RSA Security.

The RSA algorithm involves multiplying two large prime numbers a prime number is a number divisible only by that number and 1 and through additional operations deriving a set of two numbers that constitutes the public key and another set that is the private key. Once the keys have been developed the original prime numbers are no longer important and can be discarded. Both the public and the private keys are needed for encryption decryption but only the owner of a private key ever needs to know it. Using the RSA system the private key never needs to be sent across the Internet.

The private key is used to decrypt text that has been encrypted with the public key. Thus if User A sends User B a message User A can find out User B s public key but not User B s private key from a central administrator and encrypt a message to User B using User B s public key. When User B receives it User B decrypts it with User B s private key. In addition to encrypting messages which ensures privacy User B can authenticate himself to User A so User A knows that it is really User B who sent the message by using User B s private key to encrypt a digital certificate. When User A receives it User A can use User B s public key to decrypt it.

In an aspect the network includes the Internet. In another aspect the stores the distributors the suppliers the supply chain manager and the office of the supply chain manager communicate utilizing a network based interface.

An E mail system can be used to report information if external mail capabilities that support the Internet are present. Any existing Internet account can be used as can one from a value added service provider e.g. America On line Compuserv Microsoft Network etc. . If there are no existing E Mail capabilities an account can be established with an Internet Service Provider.

SMTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is a TCP IP protocol used in sending and receiving e mail. However since it s limited in its ability to queue messages at the receiving end it s usually used with one of two other protocols POP3 or Internet Message Access Protocol that let the user save messages in a server mailbox and download them periodically from the server. In other words users typically use a program that uses SMTP for sending e mail and either POP3 or IMAP for receiving messages that have been received for them at their local server. Most mail programs such as Eudora let you specify both an SMTP server and a POP server. On UNIX based systems sendmail is the most widely used SMTP server for e mail. A commercial package Sendmail includes a POP3 server and also comes in a version for Windows NT.

The next step is testing E mail connectivity by sending a message to Supply Chain management s Test Mailbox. A response is made via other communications means in the event the E mail transmission is not received. A reply to the message via E mail is made once successfully received. As an option a file attachment any text ASCII file can be included to verify the ability to send messages with separate file attachments.

After receiving confirmation concerning a successful Test Message an actual data file created from the Franchisee Information Layout section below is sent to the TEST Mailbox. After receiving confirmation concerning successful processing of the Test data a notification is sent to begin Production reporting according to the reporting period specified in the Franchisee Information Layout section.

All records that are similar are considered a logical group of data. Each record in a group has a unique identifier called a Record Type consisting of three alphanumeric characters. This should be placed before the first field of each record see the Example above in the Franchisee Information Layout section and repeated on each row.

A Field can represent a qualifier a value or text such as a description . A Field can be thought of as a piece of data.

Based upon the sequential position assignment of a Field in the Record each Field assumes a unique or numeric location for each Record. The value of the FLD column represents the position within the Record where the individual Field appears i.e. FLD 01 will be the first Field following the Record Type FLD 02 will be the second Field following the Record Type etc. .

Fields can be either left or right justified. The Record Type should always precede the first field. All Fields should completely fill their column sizes pad with spaces .

The minus sign and the decimal point are counted when determining the length of the data element Field value.

All files can be requested in a fixed length ASCII format. Programmatically these are simple to produce. Many PC applications include an export utility which allows specification of column widths and formats. When using spreadsheet applications column widths and formats may have to be pre set to produce the desired results. Empty Fields can be filled with spaces.

Files can be compressed. Compressing files will typically reduce file sizes to some 20 of their initial size. Preferably the system supports the use of ZIP files created from a PC. Before transmission all files would be compressed into one ZIP file using PKZIP a file compression package available from most software sources.

In an aspect all of the interfaces may be written in hypertext mark up language. In another aspect the information may identify the distributors and the suppliers. In an additional aspect the link may include a hyperlink. In a further aspect the linking may require the entry of an identification code.

In an embodiment of the present invention a supply chain coordinator web site may be provided to allow users easy access to specific information that relates to their role in the restaurant management system.

In one embodiment users may be registered with the supply chain management system. Upon registration the user may then be able to access and partake some or all of the features of the supply chain management system. The users can be registered based on information regarding pre existing relationships based on new information etc. Actual registration may be accomplished manually via telephone or online for example. Some illustrative registration information that can be collected may include for example 

The users may be assigned to specific user groups based on their function. Some exemplary user groups include 

In addition users may be linked to the specific retailers distribution centers and Areas of Direct Influence ADI s with which they are involved.

Convenient links to other web sites e.g. a retail management corporation web site such as for example the Burger King Corporation web site or the National Franchise Association web site may be included on the supply chain coordinator start page.

In a preferred embodiment to access the appropriate home page for a specific user group the user may enter the designated user name and password in the log in section near the top of the start page and enters the appropriate site.

In an aspect the parameters relate to a forecasted amount of the required goods. In another aspect the network includes the Internet. In a further aspect the information is displayed utilizing a network based interface. In one aspect the stores include restaurants.

In an aspect the parameters relate to a forecasted amount of the required goods to be delivered to the stores. In another aspect the network includes the Internet. In a further aspect the information is displayed utilizing a network based interface. In an additional aspect the stores include restaurants.

This report may also include a daily total for each inventory item for the past 14 days and weekly totals for the 4 weeks prior to the 14 days as well as a calculation of prior day usage as a percentage of average daily usage for the past 14 days. In a preferred embodiment this report may be recalculated daily. For example in an exemplary a report containing the prior day s sales can be available after 3 PM on the following business day.

Another report that may be displayed via the supply chain coordinator web site is a service level report which lists each distribution center s fill rate on time percentage and the percentage of perfect orders. The service level report may also indicate how the fill rate on time and perfect order for each distribution center compare to the minimum standards set by supply chain coordinator and restaurant management corporation.

The local promotion summary by distribution center report may also show how many restaurants in the ADI which are served by the distribution center are participating in the promotion and lists the specific restaurant management company s restaurant numbers for restaurants not participating in the promotion see Non Participating Restaurants column .

In calculating the data the average per restaurant unit sales of each menu item are computed based on the restaurants sampled and then multiplied by the total number of restaurants served to determine implied total sales by menu item. The report may include 

In a preferred embodiment the POS implied daily usage supplier report may be recalculated daily. For example a report containing the prior day s sales can be available after 3 PM on the following business day.

Another report that may be displayed via the supply chain coordinator web site is an average restaurant daily POS sales report which provides average restaurant daily menu item sales grouped by category and indicates the changes from a prior period. In a preferred embodiment this report may be recalculated daily. For example an average restaurant daily POS sales report containing the prior day s sales can be available after 3 PM on the following business day from the day the information was obtained.

In a preferred embodiment only inventory items that supply chain coordinator purchases are included. Also if a franchisee has not appointed supply chain coordinator as supply chain manager only the distribution center cost will be available in the report and the franchisee may add the mark up as per the franchisee s contract with the distributor. Like the other reports available via the supply chain coordinator web site the restaurant landed cost verification report may be recalculated daily and may be printed at any time for any date.

This provides a degree of confidentiality among competitors who are supply chain participants. Because many of the participants may need to disclose trade secrets to the supply chain manager such as prices sources of raw materials and quantity data they may be wary of joining. By providing a separate interface on a per participant basis trade secretes are protected and competitors are more likely to join. Further this avoids antitrust issues as sales information can be kept secret to all but the supply chain coordinator.

In one aspect the database may include data representative of sales by the stores. As another aspect the database may include data representative of goods ordered by the stores. As an additional aspect the database may include data representative of goods delivered by the distributors. As a further aspect the database may include data representative of goods in an inventory of the suppliers. Also the data may be displayed in each of the web pages utilizing the Internet.

The underlying concept of electronic commerce EC is to use information to displace time and cost in the supply chain. The Integrated Supply Chain Management system ISCM portal functions as the electronic commerce facilitator in the supply chain by efficiently collecting transporting transforming and sharing information across the enterprise.

The process works as follows. Restaurants send detailed menu sales information to the ISCM each day from their point of sale POS registers. The POS data is converted from menu sales data to material usage data. Specifically a recipe or bill of materials is used to convert each menu item into its purchased components e.g. bun meat wrapper etc. . The usage data is made available to the supply chain via the ISCM portal. The data is made available to the portal community in the following forms. Distributors see the daily usage of the materials they supply to the restaurants they service. Additionally this usage will be broken down by their distribution center locations. Suppliers see the daily usage of the products commodities that they supply to the distributors who service the restaurants. Additionally this usage will be broken down by their plant locations. The franchisee and individual restaurants can view sales in the contexts of material usage.

The restaurants can enter orders and send them to the distributor electronically via the ISCM portal. This information enables the entire supply chain to better plan inventory stocking levels and replenishments. This improved planning results in several supply chain efficiencies and benefits. Waste obsolescence and carrying costs that result from excessive inventories are reduced. The amount of lost sales that result from inventories that are inadequate to meet demand is reduced. Fewer emergency and expedited orders are created. Advanced shipment planning is enabled which results in lower freight and transportation costs.

The electronic ordering capability enables the restaurants to reduce the costs and times associated with preparing submitting and receiving orders.

The ISCM system can be enhanced with additional capabilities that serve to further increase the efficiency of the supply chain. These may include electronic invoicing electronic funds transfer to pay invoices evaluated receipt settlement bar coding and tracking capabilities.

In one aspect of the present invention the barcode is attached at the start of the process so that a common barcode is used throughout the shipping process. However barcodes can also be attached at other points in the process if desired.

In an aspect the network may include the Internet. In another aspect the results may be accessible utilizing a network based interface. In a further aspect the supply chain participant may comprise a restaurant. In one aspect the supply chain participant may be allowed access only after an identity thereof is verified. In an additional aspect the goods may have the bar code adhered thereto.

System management becomes more complicated when security and access management are added to it. They expand the role of ISCM portal to include the function of enterprise gatekeeper in addition to that of information distribution facilitator.

The underlying concepts of electronic commerce EC and security and access management are somewhat at odds. EC makes the supply chain more efficient by facilitating the flow information throughout the enterprise. Security and access management on the other hand restricts access and the flow of information. They may be some of the evils that are needed to prevent outsiders from accessing the system and its data prevent unauthorized users from performing restricted activities and preserve privacy within the enterprise by limiting data access to a need to know basis.

Although security is an ingredient to the electronic commerce business model it has a price that can be measured in direct out of pocket costs ease of use flexibility administration overhead and system maintenance and flexibility. The greater the protection against unauthorized access and use the greater the cost of the system and the cost of using the system.

Regarding ease of user the greater the security of a system the harder it is to use. For example a security arrangement that requires different passwords to access each sub function of a system would be very secure. On the other hand it would be perceived by its end users as inefficient and hard to use because of the many passwords that are needed. The end users would prefer a less secure single log on that provides them access to all the functions and data in a system.

In an EC community that is populated by several different players flexibility in specifying access privileges is important. This due to the fact that the access arrangements can accommodate different functions e.g. franchisees distributors suppliers the supply chain coordinator retail management etc. and different organizations within a given function. The more flexible the system the easier it is for the users to adapt it to their organization. However the price of flexibility in this area is either less security simplicity or greater complexity and system development and maintenance costs.

The greater the security of a system the greater the administrative effort needed to setup users and to maintain security. Additionally the administrative effort becomes more complex as greater security is required and the complexity effort increases over time as the system ages.

Complex systems are inflexible and difficult to enhance and maintain. Security makes systems complex in two ways. First through the introduction of the programs modules needed to protect the system. Second by introducing code that attempts to insulate the end user from security i.e. provide high security without sacrificing flexibility ease of use etc. . Insulating complexity can become very pervasive and expensive. As systems grow and expand the users should be insulated across new modules features and data views in a fashion consistent with the original approach. This can be difficult when 3rd party software is used or when a new feature does not conform to some earlier assumptions regarding users or system structure.

Security challenges the designers of EC systems to provide a level of security that is appropriate for the system s data and users while minimizing the direct and indirect costs of security that were just discussed. Additionally the designer may try to anticipate the future growth and the expansion of the EC system so that its security architecture can easily accommodate new features users and data.

The user community is comprised of several entities. These include retail outlets franchisees distributors suppliers the supply chain coordinator and retailer management . Security attributes and domains need to be established for each entity. Administrative procedures and programs need to be provided to establish and maintain the security attributes and domains of each of these differing entities.

Security management for data access will be complex because data is shared across the community. A single data item e.g. daily beef usage for a restaurant can belong to several domains e.g. restaurant retailer franchisee distributor supplier etc. .

The variety of user communities and the organizational variations that are found within each create a challenge to provide a flexible sub administrative capability that will enable user organizations to manage their own domains.

The security challenges and the tradeoffs created by them will be covered in detail in the technical design and recommendation sections.

The community member relationships can be characterized as follows. Supply chain management gives distributors the exclusive right to supply all retailers in the distributor s geographic territory. Retailers order from their assigned distributor. Retailer management approves commodity suppliers . Supply chain management specifies the approved commodity suppliers that each distributor will use. Distributors replenish their inventories by ordering supplies from the suppliers designated by supply chain management.

The purpose of the following sub sections is to look at the members of the supply chain community in terms of member characteristics supply chain role that is performed by each member and how each member is organized to perform their role and members personnel who will likely interact with ISCM. Member domains that will form the basis for security and access management are also defined.

The supply chain coordinator manages the supply chain for their member s retailers. Its services include 

In one aspect the network includes the Internet. In another aspect the electronic order form is generated by the at least one store. In a further aspect the electronic order form is generated by the distributor. In an additional aspect the suppliers are selected using the data. In yet another aspect the suppliers are selected using performance information collected regarding the suppliers.

The members are franchisees who own one to several hundred retail outlets. They also are the owners of the supply chain coordinator cooperative and as such they are the primary focus ISCM from efficiency and cost reduction points of view.

In the initial form of ISCM members perform three functions. They create retailer orders and send them to distributors for processing. They provide daily POS data to supply chain management who will then enhance it and provide it to members distributors and supplier on an aggregated basis to assist them in planning inventories and purchases. Also they retrieve and view orders and enhanced sales history data.

The member organizations that ISCM can support vary from a single level organization to ones that can contain as many as four levels. The structure depends on the nature of the business entity sole proprietorship partnership or corporation the size number of retail outlets and the preferences of the owner CEO board partners. The structure impacts ISCM as it dictates the number width and depth of data domain levels that ISCM supports. illustrates a multi level complex member organization . The table below illustrates ISCM user functions. Looking to the Usage Type an Active User uses ISCM in the course of doing their daily job. A Passive User may use ISCM information doesn t need it to do job.

Distributors are middlemen with whom the supply chain coordinator has contracted to supply all member retailers in a given geography.

The distributors serve a large geography. As a result they have several strategically located distribution centers throughout their territory. These distribution centers maintain local inventories and service retailers in their locale to reduce transportation time and costs.

Functions such as sales accounting billing customer service are generally centralized at a headquarters location.

In one aspect the information relates to a timeliness of delivery of the goods. In another aspect the information relates to a quality of the goods delivered by the distributor. In a further aspect the information relates to a price of the goods delivered by the distributor. In an additional aspect an alert is sent upon the comparison indicating a discrepancy between the tracked information and the terms of the contract. In such an aspect the alert may be made available on the network based interface.

In one aspect the network includes the Internet. In another aspect the electronic order forms are generated by the at least one store. In a further aspect the comparison is accessible utilizing a network based interface. In an additional aspect the electronic order forms indicate a type of the goods an amount of goods and a target delivery date of the goods. In another aspect the comparison is used to gauge a performance of the distributors.

Suppliers produce the items that the retailers buy from the distributors. Distributors replenish their inventories with bulk purchases from suppliers.

All suppliers are approved by retail outlet management. The supply chain coordinator negotiates agreements with suppliers on behalf of their members. Distributors can utilize supply chain coordinator specified suppliers to service the restraints.

Large national regional suppliers will have several production processing facilities around the country. The facilities that will supply the distributors are inspected and approved by retailer management. The supply chain coordinator can specify the supplier facility that will be used to replenish each distributor distribution center.

In one aspect the network includes the Internet. In another aspect the electronic order forms are generated by the at least one store. In a further aspect the comparison is accessible utilizing a network based interface. In yet another aspect the electronic order forms indicate a type of the goods and an amount of goods. In an additional aspect the comparison is used to gauge a performance of the suppliers.

The following table depicts the domains for access and reporting for members distributors and suppliers.

In one aspect the information relates to a timeliness of deliveries made by the distributors. In another aspect the information relates to a quality of the goods delivered by the distributors. In a further aspect the information relates to a price of the goods delivered by the distributors. In an additional aspect a store from which the information is received is identified. As another aspect the store from which the information is received may be identified utilizing an electronic mail address for communication purposes.

In an aspect the catalog displays a plurality of raw products from which the goods are produced. In such an aspect the catalog may display a plurality of distributors from which the raw products can be ordered. As a further aspect the catalog may also display a comparison of performance of the distributors. As an additional aspect the performance may be calculated based on the data. In an another aspect the catalog may include links to additional network based interfaces relating to suppliers.

When defining the features and functionality of a newly designed system it is recommended to begin with the actual business needs of the users of the web portal. It has already been defined in the section entitled User Characteristics that the users of the web portal will be managing and maintaining many if not all of the security administrative aspects of the system.

It is important to gather and understand the business needs for each user community and then translate those needs into actual Critical To Quality CTQ requirements. To obtain these CTQs each user group supplied their own Voice Of the Customer VOC demands upon the system.

The VOCs are then mapped into high level categories that ultimately map to desired features and functional requirements discussed in the section entitled Functional Requirements below .

The overall approach uses a six sigma consulting methodology for mapping customers directly to solution design and is outlined in the .

Using this approach it is possible to design a system solution that ties directly back to the core customer groups and their business needs. Features and high level functional requirements are the core to system design and using the Six Sigma consulting methodology maintains the integrity of the original business needs as presented by the key stakeholders for the web portal.

The next set of sections will detail the specific VOCs and CTQs that were collected in the workshop sessions. These CTQs will then be tied to the features and functional requirements as outlined in the section entitled Functional Requirements below.

Each of the core customer communities as outlined in the section entitled User Characteristics were interviewed to collect their VOCs in relation to a web security model. Each workshop discussed potential portal applications and their functionality providing a back drop for the potential security needs of the system. The following table lists all of the VOCs collected at each workshop and places them into high level categories.

The VOCs identify most of the security concerns for each user community. These statements are then assessed to fall into distinct and measurable requirements the critical to quality factors for each of the stated issues.

The following table outlines how each of the high level VOCs categories map to specific CTQ requirements and these items will ultimately map to the desired features and functionality of the security system.

Any security model will require certain business processes and procedures to maintain the integrity and ease of use. This section outlines some business processes that need to be in place to begin implementation.

The next section entitled Policy Requirements will further identify specify policies that surround and govern aspects of these processes. It is important to note that these procedures need to be assigned clearly to responsible parties and the policies outlined in the Section entitled Policy Requirements below should be clearly provided in order to maintain system integrity.

The first procedure that needs to be addressed is how to add and delete users to the system. Users are defined as an individual who requires access to applications and data on the web portal. This process should be replicated throughout the domains and user communities always managed by a specifically named administrator role see Administration below .

These steps can exist at all user community levels and also for providing administrator access such as from the supply chain coordinator corporate to a Member organization. It is important to provide an authorization step before creating an account so that the administrator is also monitored for security purposes.

The confirmation of deletion may be a useful step as security breaches are most likely to occur from an improperly deleted account. The supply chain coordinator should require all levels of security management to provide verification of deleted accounts especially in the member and supplier distributor communities.

At times the key contact administrator within a domain organization may change. While the process of adding a new user as an administrator follows the same process as adding a new user there are a few additional kick off steps that initiate the process. The key contact in this process is not the account contact not the Member owner or supplier contact person but is in fact the web portal administrator for that organization.

When the key contact for the security system changes at a domain organization it is not likely that the supply chain coordinator administrator will be directly notified of the change. That is why it is useful for the account manager to verify the change and obtain the new user information and submit the request. This process ensures that the administrator is acting upon an authorized and verified request. The process may be audited to trace where the authorization initiated in the event a false transfer of rights is made.

This section describes in detail the procedures to follow for auditing and monitoring the security system usage. What to collect how to collect it and how to preserve the integrity of the audit data are all useful procedures for maintaining proper and effective security measures.

In one aspect the electronic order forms include a price of the goods. In another aspect a price of the goods is calculated from the electronic order forms. In such an aspect the price of the goods may be calculated from the electronic order forms utilizing a table mapping a plurality of goods with a plurality of prices. In further aspect the electronic order forms are generated by the stores. In an additional aspect an alert is generated upon a discrepancy being found during the comparison.

Audit data should include any attempt to achieve a different security level by any person process or other entity in the network. This information includes login and logout super user access administrator rights and any other change of access or status. The processes outlined previously include a fair amount of authorization and verification steps these steps are important to create cross domain cross organizational audit trails.

The actual data to collect may differ for the different types of applications and different types of access changes made within the portal. In general the information to collect includes 

One very important note Do not gather passwords. There is an enormous potential for security breach if the audit records are improperly accessed. Do not gather incorrect passwords either as they often differ from the correct passwords by only a single character or transposition.

File system logging is also the least reliable method. If the logging host has been compromised the file system is usually the first thing to go and an intruder could easily cover up traces of the intrusion.

Collecting audit data on a write once device is slightly more effort to configure than a simple file but it has the significant advantage of greatly increased security because an intruder could not alter the data showing that an intrusion has occurred. The disadvantage of this method is the need to maintain a supply of storage media and the cost of that media. Also the data may not be instantly available.

Line printer logging is useful in system where permanent and immediate logs are required. A real time system is an example of this where the exact point of a failure or attack may be recorded. A laser printer or other device that buffers data e.g. a print server may suffer from lost data if buffers contain the needed data at a critical instant. The disadvantage of literally paper trails is the need to keep the printer fed and the need to scan records by hand. There is also the issue of where to store the potentially enormous volume of paper that may be generated.

For each of the logging methods described there is also the issue of securing the path between the device generating the log and actual logging device i.e. the file server tape CD ROM drive printer . If that path is compromised logging can be stopped. In an ideal world the logging device would be directly attached by a single simple point to point cable. Since that is usually impractical the path may pass through the minimum number of networks and routers.

If the supply chain coordinator selects an outsourced host for the security system these options can be optimized against security breaches. Keeping this audit collection process in house would require effort to secure the various options for maintaining audit data integrity detailed further in the following sub section.

Audit data should be some of the most carefully secured data at the site and in the backups. If an intruder were to gain access to audit logs the systems themselves in addition to the data would be at risk.

Audit data may also become useful to the investigation apprehension and prosecution of the perpetrator of an incident. If a data handling plan is not adequately defined prior to an incident it may mean that there is no recourse in the aftermath of an event and it may create liability resulting from improper treatment of the data.

Due to the content of audit data there are a number of legal questions that arise which might need to be addressed by legal counsel. As the Supply Chain management system collects and saves audit data it needs to be prepared for consequences resulting both from its existence and its content.

One area concerns the privacy of individuals. In certain instances audit data may contain personal information. Searching through the data even for a routine check of the system s security could represent an invasion of privacy. The privacy policy outlined in the Policy Requirements section below should clearly outline procedures that guarantee privacy of an individual user both in terms of existing contracts such as between members and retailer management and also other existing legal regulations.

A second area of concern involves knowledge of intrusive behavior originating from the web portal. If an organization keeps audit data is it responsible for examining it to search for incidents If a host in one organization is used as a launching point for an attack against another organization can the second organization use the audit data of the first organization to prove negligence on the part of that organization 

The operative philosophy in the event of a breach of web security is to react according to a plan. This is true whether the breach is the result of an external intruder attack unintentional damage a student testing some new program to exploit vulnerability or a disgruntled employee. Each of the possible types of events such as those just listed should be addressed in advance by adequate contingency plans.

Traditional web security while quite important in the overall site security plan usually pays little attention to how to actually handle an attack once one occurs. When an attack is in progress many decisions are made in haste and can be damaging while tracking down the source of the incident collecting evidence to be used in prosecution efforts preparing for the recovery of the system and protecting the valuable data contained on the system.

One of the most important and often overlooked benefits for efficient incident handling is an economic one. Having both technical and managerial personnel respond to an incident requires considerable resources. If trained to handle incidents efficiently less staff time is required when one occurs.

Another benefit is related to public relations. News about computer security incidents tends to be damaging to an organization s stature among current or potential clients. Efficient incident handling minimizes the potential for negative exposure. In the member community it is important to maintain good public relations with retail management suppliers and distributors in the interest of positive supply chain collaboration.

A final benefit of efficient incident handling is related to legal issues. It is possible that in the near future organizations may be held responsible because one of their nodes was used to launch a network attack. In a similar vein people who develop patches or workarounds may be sued if the patches or workarounds are ineffective resulting in compromise of the systems or if the patches or workarounds themselves damage systems. Knowing about operating system vulnerabilities and patterns of attacks and then taking appropriate measures to counter these potential threats may be helpful in circumventing possible legal problems.

It is important to establish contacts with various personnel before a real incident occurs. These contacts should include local managers and system administrators administrative contacts for other domain organizations and various investigative organizations.

For each type of communication contact specific Points of Contact POC should be defined. These may be technical or administrative in nature and may include legal or investigative agencies as well as service providers and vendors. When establishing these contacts it is important to decide how much information will be shared with each class of contact. It is especially important to define ahead of time what information will be shared with the users at a site with the public including the press and with other sites.

A list of contacts in each of these categories is an important time saver for the key contact individuals during an incident. It can be quite difficult to find an appropriate person during an incident when many urgent events are ongoing. It is strongly recommended that all relevant telephone numbers also electronic mail addresses and fax numbers be included in the site security policy. The names and contact information of all individuals who will be directly involved in the handling of an incident should be placed at the top of this list.

When an incident occurs the first step is to identify if it truly is a security incident. Most signs of virus infection system intrusions malicious users etc. are simply anomalies such as hardware failures or suspicious system user behavior. To assist in identifying whether there really is an incident it is usually helpful to obtain and use any detection software that may be available. Audit information is also extremely useful especially in determining whether there is a network attack.

It is extremely important to obtain a system snapshot as soon as one suspects that something is wrong. Many incidents cause a dynamic chain of events to occur and an initial system snapshot may be the most valuable tool for identifying the problem and any source of attack. Finally it is important to start a log book. Recording system events access to data time stamps etc. may lead to a more rapid and systematic identification of the problem and is the basis for subsequent stages of incident handling.

This list is not comprehensive but does highlight some common indicators of security incidents. It is recommended to collaborate with other technical and web security personnel to make a decision as a group about whether an incident is occurring.

In the event of an incident with legal consequences it is important to establish contact with investigative agencies e.g. the FBI and Secret Service in the U.S. as soon as possible. It should be acknowledged that the supply chain coordinator and it s user community organizations may have its own local and governmental laws and regulations that will impact how they interact with law enforcement and investigative agencies. The security policies and procedures need to identify those potential differences to help the various domain organizations follow consistent incident response methods.

The supply chain coordinator should notify legal counsel soon after knowledge of an incident is in progress. At a minimum legal counsel needs to be involved to protect the legal and financial interests of the web portal and subsequent member organizations. There are many legal and practical issues a few of which are 

There are no clear precedents yet on the liabilities or responsibilities of organizations involved in a security incident or who might be involved in supporting an investigative effort. Investigators will often encourage organizations to help trace and monitor intruders. Indeed most investigators cannot pursue computer intrusions without extensive support from the organizations involved. However investigators cannot provide protection from liability claims and these kinds of efforts may drag on for months and may take a lot of effort.

On the other hand an organization s legal council may advise extreme caution and suggest that tracing activities be halted and an intruder shut out of the system. This in itself may not provide protection from liability and may prevent investigators from identifying the perpetrator.

The balance between supporting investigative activity and limiting liability is tricky the supply chain coordinator should consider the advice of legal counsel and the damage the intruder is causing if any when making the decision about what to do during any particular incident.

It is crucial during a major incident to communicate why certain actions are being taken and how the users or departments are expected to behave. In particular it should be made very clear to users what they are allowed to say and not say to the outside world including other departments . For example it would not be good for an organization if users replied to customers with something like I m sorry the systems are down we ve had an intruder and we are trying to clean things up. It would be much better if they were instructed to respond with a prepared statement like I m sorry our systems are unavailable they are being maintained for better service in the future. 

Communications with customers and contract partners should be handled in a sensible but sensitive way. One can prepare for the main issues by preparing a checklist. When an incident occurs the checklist can be used with the addition of a sentence or two for the specific circumstances of the incident.

One of the most important issues to consider is when who and how much to release to the general public through the press. The public relations office is trained in the type and wording of information released and will help to assure that the image of the site is protected during and after the incident if possible . A public relations office has the advantage that one can communicate candidly with them and provide a buffer between the constant press attention and the need of the POC to maintain control over the incident.

If a public relations office is not available the information released to the press can be carefully considered. If the information is sensitive it may be advantageous to provide only minimal or overview information to the press. It is possible that any information provided to the press will be quickly reviewed by the perpetrator of the incident. Also note that misleading the press may backfire and cause more damage than releasing sensitive information.

The purpose of containment is to limit the extent of an attack. A part of containment is decision making e.g. determining whether to shut a system down disconnect from a network monitor system or network activity set traps disable functions such as remote file transfer etc. .

Sometimes this decision is trivial shut the system down if the information is classified sensitive or proprietary. Removing all access while an incident is in progress obviously notifies all users including the alleged problem users that the administrators are aware of a problem this may have a deleterious effect on an investigation. In some cases it is prudent to remove all access or functionality as soon as possible then restore normal operation in limited stages. In other cases it is worthwhile to risk some damage to the system if keeping the system up might enable identification of an intruder.

The supply chain coordinator should define acceptable risks in dealing with an incident and should prescribe specific actions and strategies accordingly. If features and functionality need to be shut town temporarily there should be a notification process as well as a back up non web based process to continue normal business operations. As application functionality is implemented into the web portal each web feature needs to address the potential for shutdown.

There are a number of steps the supply chain coordinator should implement to keep up with changes in web security. The following is a list of activities to include for continual incident tracking and handling measures 

Web Portal security policies are designed to address security issues within an Internet community. The supply chain coordinator needs a guide to setting computer security policies and procedures for sites that have systems on the Internet and may need to also address sites and systems that are not yet connected to the Internet.

The web portal team will need to make many decisions gain agreement and then communicate and implement these security policies. The focus of this section is on the policies and procedures that need to be in place in order to support the technical security features of the ISC web portal.

The basic approach to developing a security policy plan for a web portal follows traditional protection rules for overall system security Fites 1989 Control and Security of Computer Information Systems 

Using approach the supply chain coordinator will be able to continually identify critical assets and required policies throughout the implementation phase for both the security system as well as future releases of functionality for the web portal.

The types of security related decisions that are made or the failure to make them largely determine how secure or insecure the web portal will be how much functionality the portal will offer and how easy the portal is to use. To effectively use security tools and policies the supply chain coordinator may determine its security goals clearly.

the supply chain coordinator goals should be communicated to all users operations staff and managers through a set of security rules called a security policy. The scope of this policy includes all types of information technology as well as the information stored and manipulated by the technology.

The main purpose of a security policy is to inform users staff and managers of their obligatory requirements for protecting technology and information assets. The policy should specify the mechanisms through with these requirements may be met. Another purpose is to provide a baseline from which to acquire configure and audit systems and networks for compliance with the policy. Therefore an attempt to use a set of security tools in the absence of at least an implied security policy is meaningless.

The cost of protecting oneself against a threat should be less than the cost of recovering if the threat were to strike. Cost in this context should include losses expressed in real currency reputation and trustworthiness. Without reasonable knowledge of what one is protecting and what the likely threats are following this rule of cost effectiveness may be difficult.

It is recommended that as the supply chain coordinator designs and implements additional functionality to their ISC web portal they examine the extent of security levels and features in relation to the value of the assets involved. There are two elements of risk analysis that one should consider 

In an aspect the network may include the Internet. In another aspect the identifier may include a numeric string. In a further aspect the identifier may indicate a region where the associated store is located. In an additional aspect the data may be listed utilizing a network based interface. In one aspect the supply chain participants may include restaurants.

For each asset the basic goals of security are availability confidentiality and integrity. Each threat should be examined considering how it may affect these areas. The first step for asset protection is to identify all of the things that need protection. The point is to list all things that could be affected by a security problem. Again a traditional list for system protection is applicable in the Internet arena 

The supply chain coordinator should use the preliminary goals and objectives for the ISC web portal to identify the primary assets. Existing procedures and policies for system protection is a good starting point to begin the process for asset identification.

Once identified it is important to note the differing levels of importance for each of these categories to the users of the portal. For example a member may hold his or her hardware assets at a higher protection value than a supplier who may have leased assets or complete warranty and maintenance coverage. Documentation for procedures may have higher value for the administrators at the supply chain coordinator corporate and less so at an end user level as reliance on the accuracy of these materials falls into a very defined set of users.

Once the assets requiring protection are identified it may be useful to identify the threats to those assets. The threats may then be examined to determine what potential for loss exists. The following are classic threats to be considered 

The remainder of this section will outline and identify security policies that address these types of threats for most types of assets.

In order for a security policy to be appropriate and effective it needs to have the acceptance and support of all levels of employees within an organization. The ISC web portal has the additional challenge of integrating policy acceptance from third party organizations. These outside organizations may have conflicting policies or policies that are considered substandard to the needs for the supply chain coordinator.

It is especially important that corporate management fully support the security policy process otherwise there is little chance that they will have the intended impact no matter where the incident resides. The following list of individuals should be involved in the creation and review of security policy documents 

This list is representative but not necessarily comprehensive. The supply chain coordinator may find as it adds functionality to the web portal that additional representation may be required especially when integrating third party or member level systems and networks. It may be helpful to bring in representation from stakeholders management with budget and policy authority technical staff with knowledge about what can and cannot be supported and legal counsel that understand the legal ramifications of various policy choices.

This section will discuss the specific policy requirements for the web portal. The recommended policies are based on Internet industry standards and best practices for web portal security.

An Appropriate Use Policy AUP may also be part of a security policy. It should spell out what users shall and shall not do on the various components of the system including the type of traffic allowed on the networks. The AUP should be as explicit as a possible to avoid ambiguity or misunderstanding.

Privacy of files and information stored on or within the web portal applications needs to be assured. User information that includes name address financial information and other confidential information may at times need to be shared.

Sometimes during the normal course of operations a member of the web portal support staff will have a need to view a file belonging to another user of the system. Some examples are helping a user with an application problem which requires access to the supply chain coordinator s source program or helping a user resolve an electronic mail problem which requires viewing part of the user s mail message file. Whenever required to view a user s file in the course of helping that user the consent of the user can be first obtained. In all cases the client should be advised that his her file s may need to be viewed accessed to assist them.

When assisting web portal users it is recommended that the Support Staff should use the following guidelines 

The privacy policy should define reasonable expectations of privacy regarding other issues such as monitoring of electronic mail logging of keystrokes as well as access to users files.

Clearly defined access policies may be helpful to the success for implementing and sustaining a secured web portal. The ability to grant access rights occurs throughout the levels of security as defined by the business needs for the supply chain coordinator corporate members suppliers and distributors. This complexity forces the need for an effective access policy to assure clear adherence to these business rules.

An access policy needs to define access rights and privileges to protect assets from loss or disclosure by specifying acceptable use guidelines for users operations staff and management. It should provide guidelines for external connections data communications connecting devices to a network and adding new software to systems. It should also specify any required notification messages e.g. connect messages should provide warnings about authorized usage and line monitoring and not simply say Welcome .

The web portal has identified several concerns as outlined in the voice of the customer VOC section earlier and from those issues is the following recommended approach for granting restricting and monitoring access rights 

Note The Chief Security Officer should recognize that there may be instances where compelling business need warrants use of a system that cannot comply with this standard. It is strongly recommended that requests for exceptions must be approved by the Chief Security Officer.

The following items should be part of the overall access policy as well as detailed in separate and distinct policy statements see the following sections 

Authorization refers to the process of granting privileges to processes and ultimately to users. This differs from Authentication in that authentication is the process used to identify a user see next section . Once identified reliably the privileges rights property and permissible actions of the user are determined by authorization.

In a reasonable security system it is impossible to explicitly list all of the authorized activities of each user with respect to all resources. The recommended approach is outlined within the section entitled Technology below that allows for roles and groupings to help manage and maintain the authorization levels for collections of users. The Technology section also describes how hierarchies can be implemented to provide greater flexibility for authorization and expend authorization controls to span of data control as well as application access control.

However a solution is implemented policies governing authorization should include the following stipulations 

Administration of access rights should be simple and easy to maintain. Policies that specify administrative users and their access rights and privileges should be clearly defined before assigning responsibilities. Who is responsible for what types of administration activities will be the primary result of definitive access policies specifically for administrators. Certain aspects of access policy will simply the role of the administrator including the following items 

It is important to clearly identify within the Access policy that these activities are monitored and tracked. A review process should be in place to assure that the access rights and privileges are granted appropriately. The following aspects should be addressed in the Access policy 

If a data processing system is used as a record keeping system sufficient backup should be provided to allow recovery of the security activity records in case of system problems.

Records that show the person to whom an ID has been issued the access requested the person who authorized it must be maintained.

Records of IDs that have been suspended and reactivated should be maintained. These will assist in detecting users who need more training or IDs that are being used for unauthorized access attempts.

Records of terminated employees access should be kept on hand for at least six months after termination. After that time period that information may be placed in accessible archives.

Records for security violations should be maintained onsite for a minimum of one month. These records will assist in detecting longer term trend and penetration attempts.

It is important to include policy and procedures for granting access as well as removing access for web portal users.

While Internet based attacks get most of the media attention most computer system break ins occur via dial up modems. The nature of the supply chain coordinator s membership and access requirements will in most cases use dial up modem access. Policies and procedures to specify and monitor the method and use of dial in access need to be stated.

There are a variety of configurations for supporting remote access via dial up lines and other means. In general the major security issue is authentication making sure that only legitimate users can remotely access your system. The use of one time passwords and hardware tokens is recommended for most companies however the supply chain coordinator s web portal user communities may not be able or willing to monitor these remote access devices particularly due to high expense and difficulty to track.

Another issue is the supply chain coordinator s ability to monitor the use of remote access capabilities. The most effective approach is to centralize the modems into remote access servers or modem pools. This design enables an easier monitoring and tracking of dial in usage.

However the supply chain coordinator has set requirements that demand higher levels of security with information sources beyond just the supply chain coordinator servers but also at third party locations so it may become useful to increase the dial in protection policy statement to the following 

Additional policy statements should address encryption within any remote access policy as suggested in the following 

It may be useful for the supply chain coordinator to put into place appropriate safeguards to limit physical access to any computer or computer related device. The retailer level access has multiple opportunities for non authorized access and may even require physical locks or other types of security devices to prevent theft of equipment. It becomes more important to set policies in place that at a minimum attempt to secure physical access in the following ways 

It is equally important to state within a physical access policy that the accountability for such access is not precluded where exceptions must be made such as in a restaurant where locked offices are not common. Users should remain accountable for usage regardless when reasonable attempts have been made to secure physical access to the web portal.

An Accountability Policy is needed to define the responsibilities of users operations staff and management. It should specify an audit capability and provide incident handling guidelines i.e. what to do and whom to contact if a possible intrusion is detected . The previous section outlined procedures for incident handling and clear accountabilities should be stated in conjunction with those processes.

An Authentication Policy establishes trust through an effective password policy and by setting guidelines for remote location authentication and the use of authentication devices e.g. one time passwords and the devices that generate them . Encryption may also be used to authenticate users as it requires possessing a key to unscramble data and this policy may apply for some of the more sensitive data exchanges provided through the web portal.

In many cases of system penetration the intruder needs to gain access to an account on the system. One way that goal is typically accomplished is through guessing the password of a legitimate user. This attempt is often accomplished by running an automated password cracking program utilizing a very large dictionary against the system s password file. The only way to guard against passwords being disclosed in this manner is through the careful selection of passwords that cannot be easily guessed i.e. combinations of numbers letters and punctuation characters . Passwords should also be as long as the system supports and users can tolerate.

Many existing security systems and application programs are installed with default accounts and passwords. These should be changed immediately to something that cannot be easily guessed or cracked.

Restrict access to the password file in particular the security system should protect the encrypted password portion of the file so that would be intruders do not have them available for cracking. One effective technique is to use shadow passwords where the password field of the standard file contains a dummy or false password. The file containing the legitimate passwords are protected elsewhere on the system.

When and how to expire passwords may become a subject of controversy among the security community. It is generally accepted that a password should not be maintained once an account is no longer in use yet it is hotly debated whether a user should be forced to change a good password that is in active use. The opposition claims that frequent password changes lead to users writing down their passwords in visible areas such as sticky notes on a terminal or for users to select very simple passwords that provide very little if any protection.

Some sites find it useful to disable accounts after a predefined number of failed attempts to authenticate. If the supply chain coordinator site uses this mechanism it is recommended that the mechanism not advertise itself. After disabling even if the correct password is presented the message displayed should remain that of a failed login attempt. Implementing this mechanism will require legitimate users to contact their system administrator to request that their account be reactivated.

At the supply chain coordinator Member level it may become cost prohibitive and even an operational nuisance to field the numerous calls that may result from retailer level users locking out of the system. This type of policy may need to be adjusted for effectiveness as one risks similar issues of writing down passwords in visible locations in order to avoid accidental lock outs.

There will be information assets that the supply chain coordinator will want to protect from disclosure to unauthorized entities. Many existing security systems have built in file protection mechanisms that allow an administrator to control who on the system may access or see the contents of a given file.

A stronger way to provide confidentiality is through encryption. Encryption is accomplished by scrambling data so that it is very difficult and time consuming for anyone other than the authorized recipients or owners to obtain the plain text. Authorized recipients and the owner of the information will possess the corresponding decryption keys that allow them to easily unscramble the text to a readable form. The supply chain coordinator should consider the extent and value of its information assets as outlined previously to determine the need for encryption protection.

Additionally the use of encryption is sometimes controlled by governmental and site regulations so the supply chain coordinator should encourage administrators to become informed of laws or policies that regulate its use before employing it. As the specific encryption needs require clearly identified data and information sources so it is outside the scope of this document to mention various programs available for this purpose. However the recommended solutions in this document include systems that provide appropriate use of encryption.

An Availability Statement sets users expectations for the availability of resources. It should address redundancy and recovery issues as well as specify operating hours and maintenance down time periods. It should also include contact information for reporting system and network failures.

An Information Technology System and Network Maintenance Policy describes how both internal and external maintenance people are allowed to handle and access technology. One important topic to be addressed here is whether remote maintenance is allowed and how such access is controlled. Another area for consideration here is outsourcing and how it is managed.

A Violations Reporting Policy indicates the types of violations that must be reported e.g. privacy and security internal and external and to whom these reports are made. A non threatening atmosphere and the possibility of anonymous reporting will result in a greater probability that a violation will be reported if it is detected.

Supporting information should provide users staff and management with contact information for each type of policy violation guidelines on how to handle outside queries about a security incident or information that may be considered confidential or proprietary and cross references to security procedures and related information such as company policies and governmental laws and regulations.

The purpose of this section is to specify the capabilities that must be available in the portal to achieve the security related CTQs.

The section will begin by defining some terms that are commonly associated with the management of security and access.

Next the portal will be viewed from the perspective of security and access management to identify the components that are associated with security and access management.

Lastly each component will be described in terms of the specific functions it must provide to effectively secure and manage portal access.

Some features that characterize the capabilities the portal must possess in order to achieve its CTQs will be used to validate each functional component. These features will include the ones that were explicitly cited in the user workshops plus some capabilities that were added after those sessions.

Community refers to all of the users of the portal. The security capabilities will be used manage access within the community.

A group relates to an organizational entity in the portal. Examples of groups are a member company or a specific supplier or distributor company.

Reasons for having roles is to define privilege. A role specifies the portal functions an individual can access.

A hierarchy is a tree structure that maps to a specific domain entity s organization e.g. member ABC .

The community management component allows administrators to manage the users in their span of control within the portal. Specifically they can add change and delete users and they can control what users can view and what functions they can perform.

The policy management component uses the user authorizations and privileges to verify that a user is authorized to perform a requested function.

The reporting component provides the administrators with user and activity information that is suitable for managing security and access.

The purpose of this section is to specify the functions that may be useful for delivering the features for achieving the portal s security related CTQ.

Each functional component will first be described in terms of purpose and general approach. Then details will be provided for each function to specify the capabilities that must be present.

Assuming that the supply chain coordinator desires to use existing 3party software as much as possible the traditional approach of specifying inputs processing and outputs for each function will not be strictly followed here. Rather the emphasis will be placed on clearly describing the full set of capabilities that will be required to deliver the features needed to meet the CTQs. The details associated with the specifics of inputs forms detailed processing and outputs will vary by vendor and the vendor s approach to providing the necessary capabilities. It will be the job of the vendors to provide these details so that the supply chain coordinator can use them to determine the best approach for their requirements.

The logon function represents the first line of security and it validates that a user is authorized to access the portal.

The authentication process begins when a user connects to the portal. At that time they will be prompted for 

The user will enter the requested data and it will be encrypted prior to sending it to the portal logon function. Additionally the password field will be masked when the user enters it i.e. it won t print on the screen when the user enters it .

Once the user has submitted the information the logon function will check the portal access control list to determine if access is permitted to the companyID userID password combination that the user submitted.

Users failing to enter a valid companyID userID password combination will be notified of the failure and re prompted. A userID will be locked out after n failures.

New passwords will be subjected to minimum security password validation rules. These will include things like minimum maximum length percent of characters that must differ uniqueness etc.

The system administrator will be notified of user ID lockout. The following table lists User Specified Features.

The community management capability allows administrators to manage the user activities within the portal. Specifically it provides the capabilities to add change and delete users and to manage what the user can see and what functions they can perform.

There are certain capabilities that affect the entire community or all of the occupants of a domain members suppliers distributors and supply chain coordinator . These are limited to a single system wide administrator and potentially to domain administrators.

The purpose of community management is to provide a sub administrator with the ability to control what their users can view and what tasks they can perform.

An administrator who has been granted administrative privileges for the sub domain that represents their organization performs community management e.g. a member s retail outlets make up the member s sub domain .

The basic model provides the administrator with tools that are used to manage a user s access view and tasks . These tools include 

Community management then provides the administrator with the ability to add change and delete users.

Lastly it enables the administrator to control user s view and access rights by associating them with a group of data related entities e.g. retailer to specify what the user can see and with a role or specific privileges to specify what tasks the user can perform.

As stated earlier a group is an organizational entity that is made up of one or more data related entities. The retail outlets owned by a franchisee comprise a member group. Groups serve to specify a user s span of control when they are associated with a user.

An administrator who has been authorized to manage groups can create new groups and change and delete existing groups.

A role is a functional entity that is made up of tasks the function is permitted to perform. A restaurant manager is a role that is permitted i.e. given a privilege to perform the tasks of ordering food and packaging and viewing forecasts.

An administrator who has been authorized to manage roles can create new roles and change and delete existing ones.

Privileges can be specified as default or optional when they are assigned to a role. Default privileges are automatically given to a user when they are assigned to a role. The administrator must explicitly specify each optional privilege yes no for a user when they are assigned a role.

A role may be assigned to a group as well as to a user. When it is associated with a group users receive the privileges specified by the role when they are associated with the group.

A user is an individual who is authorized to perform some set of tasks on behalf of a group e.g. a set of retail outlets .

An administrator who has been authorized to manage users can create new users and change and delete existing ones.

A company ID a user ID and a password identify a user. The administrator cannot view the user password.

A capability to link community management with the supply chain coordinator s member management system is required to eliminate duplicate data entry and keep the two systems synchronized.

A batch bulk load capability is required to enable user to export data from existing systems to set up their organization in the portal community.

The basic community model that was outlined in the previous section supported authorization and access management for a flat single level organization. Although this can be adapted to support a multi level organization it falls short on the CTQs related to simplicity and flexibility. Specifically the administrator must create groups to correspond to each span of control. This results in a single entity having to be included in several groups. For example a single retailer may be included in a district region and a corporate group. Administration in a scenario like this is complex and labor intensive. It becomes particularly cumbersome and error prone because things like an organization change e.g. new retail outlet requires the modification of several groups i.e. add it to district region and corporate group .

A hierarchy provides a superior way to manage span of control and access. The hierarchy defines a company s organization. A user s span of control is set by associating them to the node of the hierarchy that corresponds to their position in the company. This association authorizes them to view the data associated with any entity that belong to the node to which they are assigned. In the case of a new retail outlet assigning it to a manager also places it in the span of control of the manager s district and region mangers and the corporate CEO.

Hierarchies can also simplify the specification of user privileges by associating them to a hierarchy.

Although hierarchies introduce technical complexity they greatly simplify administration in large and complex organizations.

A hierarchy is made up of nodes where a node represents a business function e.g. retail outlet manager district manager etc. . The bottom nodes of a hierarchy are associated with a data related entity e.g. retail outlet is associated with a manager node function . They are then grouped under nodes at successively higher levels e.g. districts regions etc. . The top of the hierarchy is a single node e.g. corporate . In a hierarchy an entity e.g. retail outlet will appear in the span of control of each successive parent node. The following administrative capabilities are required to manage authorization and access with hierarchies.

Span of control relates to the data a user can view. Under a hierarchy associating a user to a node in a hierarchy specifies their span of control. This association entitles the user to view the data associated with any entity that is found in the user s node group.

Access management relates to the functions a user can perform. It is controlled by privileges and roles that are assigned to a user groups of privileges . Under a hierarchy roles and privileges can be associated to a node. Any user who is then associated to the node receives the privileges that accompany it. See the table below.

Portal data e.g. a retailer is owned by one and only one sub domain entity e.g. member . The ability to view and process that data is restricted to users and groups who inhabit the entity s sub domain and who have been authorized to do so by its administrator.

However there are several business situations where an organization needs to view and process data that is owned by another organization that may or may not belong to the same domain. Some common examples are 

The data publication capability is a mechanism for the owners e.g. member A of an entity e.g. retailer 123 to permit a users in another organization e.g. member B to view and access the entity s i.e. retailer 123 data.

Data publication is an administrative privilege. It is used by a data owner s administrator to setup a relationship with another party in the portal that will allow that party to view and access data entities e.g. retailers that are found the owner s sub domain.

The policy enforcement function is a centralized capability that manages access to all of the applications that comprise the portal.

Policies specify the access requirements for each application that makes up the portal. The policy enforcement function determines if a requesting user meets the access requirements for an application. The user is granted access by the policy enforcement function if they meet they requirements specified by the policy.

A central administrative capability is required to maintain the policies that are used to manage access to the portal s applications.

Community management reports provide administrators with the information they need to manage their users groups roles and hierarchies if implemented .

Query and filter capabilities will be required to specify report type and content e.g. a specific group a range of users all roles user usage details for date range etc. .

An event is a system activity that is written to the audit log. Examples of events include connection to the portal logon attempt application access requests add a new user system errors etc. Information will accompany an events that identifies it identifies the user that initiated it the date and time the event was initiated status success failure etc.

Events are recorded so that the details associated with them are available to research problems security breach attempts etc.

An alert capability is required to specify administrator notification email page etc. in the case of certain events e.g. attempted breach a portal application is unavailable etc. .

Because event reports from the audit log are run in response to problems or issues good filtering capabilities will be required to eliminate unneeded data and provide the administrator with only the information they are seeking. Filters should include user s event and date and time.

As detailed in the previous section the supply chain coordinator s portal may allow access to supply chain applications. The nature of the applications require a feature and function set this engagement collected CTQs and functions from the community and organized them along categories.

This section places a slightly different view of requirements on the portal. There may be a public site and a private site secured access there may also be applications behind the portal provided by 3party application service providers that fall under the private site. There may be administration pages to setup authentication and authorization policies. It is also a requirement that the portal support communications between the supply chain coordinator and the community and between community members.

The Public View Component describes the functionality that is available to users of the public web pages on the supply chain coordinator portal.

The Secure View Component describes the functionality that is available to users once they have logged onto the private pages of the supply chain coordinator portal. The private pages include access to the Applications and other functionality.

The Administrative Component describes the functionality that allows users to access administrative links available to Company Administrators and individual Users. Additionally the component contains information required for users to log on and request passwords.

The Contact Us Component describes the functionality and information that is available to users on both the public and private pages of the supply chain coordinator. This information consists of service related questions and other areas of concern for community members.

An actor is a user that plays a role with respect to the system. It is someone or something outside the application that interacts with the supply chain coordinator portal. The defined use cases and their definitions are specified below.

The systems Actors are the different types of people involved in the business process. Earlier several types of users are defined for each customer type supply chain coordinator member supply chain coordinator supplier distributor retail outlet manager . While those are separate organizations the actors in each share qualities at this high level of definition. The actors for the supply chain coordinator exchange portal are

Description A Registered User Tier 2 is a registered user who has the second level of privileges. Tier 2 Users may use applications for which they are registered but they may not sign up for additional applications without approval from their Tier 1 User.

Description A Non Registered User Tier 3 has access to the public pages of the supply chain coordinator. They may be able to register via their company administrator if the company has registered or they may be able to register via the automated registration process an option described in the upcoming sections . Until they are registered Tier 3 users may not have any level of access to the private pages of the supply chain coordinator.

They may be the only users allowed to view certain links related to report generation Similar to Content Managers and the Upload Content Link .

Business Knowledge Should be at the RailMarketplace.com Inc. or GXS executive or marketing level interested in site usage and feedback for further enhancements.

The following section is an attempt to outline the requirements expressed by stakeholders subject matter experts SMEs associated with the supply chain coordinator portal. These requirements revolve around the feature function lists collected in meetings with the supply chain community as addressed in the previous sections. This list should be considered proposed at this point and based on GE s interpretation of the features collected. IT may be finalized through prioritization and solution decisions. It may be further refined by the design process that the organization chosen to deliver this solution must complete during implementation.

A listing of these component areas along with their index key is provided below. Table 15 provides a listing of functional requirements so that they can be easily found.

Now that the features have been defined and categorized and the portal components and actors are known technology must be selected to address high priority items such as integrating affiliate sites central policy management and distributed user administration. Considerations for this selection may include the following IT strategy drivers 

Security is a major concern as web sites may contain proprietary business information such as news data information and procurement systems. Without adequate security opportunities are presented for inappropriate dissemination of proprietary information sabotage and other mischievous acts.

Comprehensive Security for the supply chain community breaks down into three areas Web Network and Security. Each of the features extends across all three areas as the following chart illustrates.

Technically from the web portal view there are two main approaches to meeting the CTQs of the supply chain communities. The first option is for the supply chain coordinator to use its existing NT infrastructure. The second option involves purchasing a portal management solution to abstract user management from applications.

If option 2 is selected there are two additional levels of implementation that are additive to option 2. These may be overall options 3 and 4 

There is a choice to be made between approach 1 and 2. Approaches 2 through 4 build on each other with approach 4 including all the functionality of choices 2 and 3 as well. Within choice 2 3 and 4 there are also sub decisions to make about products or level of customization. Table 16 illustrates chart comparing options and product customization levels.

The technology portion of this report may provide a section on each approach. The technical architecture for each may be detailed as well as decisions that can be made by the supply chain coordinator within each. Each section may then compare the functionality pieces outlined in the section entitled Fundamental Requirements to that provided by the approach being described. Finally costs and level of effort for each approach may be included at the end of each section.

After each web portal approach is documented sections on network and application development recommendations may also be included.

The supply chain coordinator already manages Windows NT user accounts for all the employees of the supply chain coordinator. This is to control access to internal business applications. The IT team has the ability to create and delete users assign user groups and assign privileges to either the individual user or the user group. Access Control Lists manage the resources each user or user group can access as well as the level of access such as Read Write or Execute. These are some of the same functional requirements for the integrated supply chain portal.

Moving to Internet based systems in the NT environment most applications developed using Microsoft languages and methods run with Microsoft IIS as the webserver. IIS has authentication functionality included. IIS also provides a authorization features as well such as Read and Write and since IIS runs as a service on top of Windows NT it relies heavily on Windows NT user accounts and the Windows NT File System.

This is the approach the supply chain coordinator uses for the pilot web portal system. The supply chain coordinator has created an NT domain for the web application to use. The supply chain coordinator is setting up user accounts in this domain and the web application is validating users against Windows NT.

For data access in the current web portal there is an association of retailers to specific supplier distributors or supply chain members. This resides in a supply chain SQL database . The application itself logs onto the database and queries the requested information using the user id as a key to make sure the proper data is retrieved for presentation back to the user.

There are ways that the supply chain coordinator could continue this operation to manage the entire community of supply chain users. This would involve centrally administering users and physically adding them to the NT user base. The supply chain coordinator would own validating users and setting up access rights and would need to communicate frequently with companies supply chain members suppliers distributors to make sure that user setup was proper.

In order to integrate 3party provided applications custom integration would be required in the link between the supply chain portal and the ASP application. The supply chain could work a transfer of user information in the http headers of linked websites. This would provide for an authentication of the user on the 3party site. After the initial transfer the user would interact with the 3party application directly with zero visibility back to the portal. Each 3party application would also need to manage users themselves and make sure that their user directories were synchronized with the supply chain coordinator. A way around this is for the third party application to trust that the user being passed is valid and to pass all application specific data to the application at the time of the link. This provides an easier administration in this model but a much lower level of security and is not recommended.

Reporting would be handled by the IIS logs. If community members wanted to know what their employees were doing on the supply chain applications they would need to submit a request to the supply chain coordinator. The supply chain coordinator would then need to manually check their logs and find out what user activities occurred. If a community member wanted to know what activities were performed on a 3party hosted application the supply chain coordinator would then need to contact the 3party provider and have them manually search their logs and provide reports back to the supply chain coordinator which could then be shared with the community member.

In a previous section the features requested by the supply chain community were detailed along with the functions those features imply. The following table shows whether functions are provided by this approach along with an explanation. Table 17 illustrates features within option one.

It is possible to custom develop additional authentication and access control functionality on top of NT based applications. Code can be written in ASP to provide this additional functionality which would provide a portion of the functionality included in the products considered for option 2. For the purpose of this study however it is assumed that the cost of such development would greater than the cost of option 2 purchasing a portal management solution.

In terms of up front cost this is the supply chain coordinator s lowest cost alternative. The NT administration features already exist the supply chain coordinator has skilled NT administrators and the equipment is already in place. An additional server may be required to handle the number of portal requests once the applications are fully available and ramped.

However this approach fails on several fronts including application integration and distributed administration. Therefore the supply chain coordinator would need to manage the community centrally with this alternative. The supply chain coordinator would need many administrators to manage the community with this approach so that should factor into the ongoing costs of this approach.

These shortfalls are especially critical considering the supply chain coordinator is planning to outsource many of the applications behind the portal to ASP providers. In a sense the supply chain coordinator may become an ASP integrator. With this in mind a component of a solution is providing a clear method for the supply chain coordinator to deliver ASP model services to members and trading partners with distributed administration.

Option 2 is based on a layer of abstraction between security and the supply chain coordinator s applications. Doing this entails purchasing a security management solution that offers single sign on and the ability to create a unified directory for users across applications. The benefit of the unified directory is the ability to enable the same user to belong to multiple applications managed by different community owners without the need to manage the user as many separate users. For example the supply chain member could belong to the supply chain board community to access board related reports. The same user may be a user of a supply chain service application such as order management. In addition the supply chain member may be enabled to access collaborative applications such as email. The issue however is that each application has its own set of privileges and roles that drive business process.

In a single entity model such as option 1 roles are defined and users are assigned privileges and roles. However the defined privileges and roles are pervasive across all applications that are accessed by that sign on. Allowing the same user to have a single sign on with different roles based upon the application community they are interacting with even the same physical application in two different communities is not possible. This is possible if the supply chain coordinator chooses to implement a single sign on infrastructure including a unified directory environment as the community is separate from the directory that defines the users. graphically shows how user roles are managed in a multi community environment .

The separation of community and directory also allows the administration in each community to be different even though the user is shared. Consider the example presented earlier in this section. The supply chain coordinator s IT may control administration for board member reports while the actual community member controls administration for the order management application. The separation allows changes to a user s profile in one community without impacting the user s existence in another. This is especially useful when adding and removing users. The supply chain coordinator may want to remove a user from the ASP order management service but still have them exist in the board member report application.

To discuss single sign on central policy management and delegated administration it is important to define two terms.

Authentication First step in single sign on. Uniquely identify a user based on company id user id and password.

Authorization Occurs after authentication. The level of application of data access allowed for an individual user.

As the integrated supply chain concept caught on organizations had to deal with the challenges of single sign on and distributed administration. These are the same issues the supply chain coordinator is dealing with as they begin their initiatives. The first response of large community owners was to custom build solutions on top of their IIS or Netscape server based applications as was suggested as possible in option 1. But as organizations began to build custom solutions there were many failures or limitations on what could be accomplished. At the same time the market has matured as the need for SSO and distributed organizations expanded to more organizations. Off the shelf single sign on portal management solutions came to market and many owners of large communities have replaced their homegrown systems with solutions based on these products which have the following features 

SSO Portal Management products are software packages that run on their own server. They also require a directory to operate against. This can be either LDAP or database directories.

The interaction between applications and the SSO Portal Management server is client server based with the application webserver using an agent or plug in client to reference the central policy server for user validation.

Within each area of the architecture there are multiple methods supported. Solutions can run on multiple operating platforms and with multiple types of user directories. Solutions can be extended with multiple development languages support many authentication technologies and operate in conjunction with many network security implementations.

When purchasing an off the shelf product the infrastructure above is part of the solution. The work that must be performed is setup user and policy management and then to actually create the users and the policies.

In a previous section the features requested by the supply chain coordinator s community were detailed along with the functions those features imply. The following table shows whether functions are provided by this approach along with an explanation. Table 18 illustrates the various features associated with option two.

In comparing this chart to the one in the last section outlining option 1 there are many more Yes functions. These are in the areas of single sign on integration of affiliate sites distributed user administration and central policy management. What is not supported in this approach are hierarchies publishing privilege rights to other users outside of one s group managing application specific data in the user profile and advanced activity reporting made available to individual users.

There are several companies who provide software and services centered around this approach. These companies include Netegrity Securant enCommerce a division of Entrust and Oblix. For the supply chain coordinator GE recommends that Netegrity and Securant be evaluated for the portal management software solution. This is as a result of research conducted for GE Global Exchange Services deployments already in production and implementation experience in the General Electric Company.

There are several differences between the two products in architecture more than function. Netegrity is the market leader and has the most large scale implementations including providing the base architecture for GE s global supplier portal and several other GXS solutions where the requirements were similar to the supply chain coordinator s. Securant waited longer to go to market but by many accounts has a better future vision and more elegant architecture. Another significant different is that Netegrity is very focused on development around LDAP where Securant uses database technology as the base under their directory structures.

In order to compare the two products data is provided below from Giga Information Group. The following is a list of criteria used by Giga Information Group to evaluate web based single sign on products 

Multiple Authentication Types All SSO products support passwords of course. But some may support additional authentication types such as biometrics digital certificates tokens or smart cards.

Authentication Method The method differs from the type by representing the underlying authentication architecture. How well does the product handle the registration suspension etc.

Quality of Administration In the case of employee SSO the emphasis is placed on easy to use administrative console intuitive commands and integration with user data repositories already in existence e.g. human resources databases . Web SSO products are evaluated similarly with the added point of distributed subordinate administration allowing multiple administrators to manage subsets of the user population.

Granular Access Management The Administrative console should permit the administrator to control authorization not only to certain applications but also under certain conditions. Web SSO products are heavily weighed on this point.

Robust Architecture How fault tolerant and efficient is the underlying architecture of the product itself How well does it scale to loads and to geographic distances 

Use of Directory Services To what extent does the product rely on directories compounded with the ability of that directory to be used for other purposes simultaneously 

End User Ease of Use For employee SSO this refers mainly to the familiar desktop experience and the elimination of normal log in interruptions. For Web SSO users this refers to the degree to which the user s desktop browser is modified in any way.

Vision Also known as product road map which vendor projects the most visionary use for its products during the next five years 

For option 2 the assumption is that the security management solution software provides single sign on authentication management entitlement management distributed administration and affiliate services. Table 19 shows list of assumed functionality for the purpose of cost and level of effort estimation 

Once hardware is acquired the supply chain coordinator may need to host the solution on a dedicated platform. This may require at least two standard server class machines one for production and one for pre production backup. The supply chain coordinator may choose to have a third box as a dedicated development and test environment or dedicated backup.

For all developers who customize and build on the security platform training may be required. The estimated time for training is a month per applied resource.

The following is an estimated list of resources that may be required to install and configure the security management solution software to provide the functionality in the table above.

Option 3 addresses many of the delegated and self administration requirements the supply chain community demands. While the product itself provide the ability to distribute administration features most of these center around assigning access privileges for applications or resources. It does not take into account distributed administration of user specific data preferences and data attributes that may be required by the applications behind the supply chain portal. The basic product also does not capture and consolidate events from multiple applications and make them available for viewing by individual users and group administrators.

In one aspect the identifier includes a password. In another aspect the data is encrypted. In a further aspect the list is updated upon receipt of a notice from at least one of the stores. In an additional aspect only certain data is displayed based on the user being one of the suppliers distributors and stores. In one aspect the network includes the Internet.

Directory structure may be useful for extending the security management solution. The exact design of the directory may be the first task for an organization implementing the extended functionality for the supply chain coordinator. Directory design is beyond the scope of this engagement but the following outlines the items to create directory structures that support the supply chain coordinator s needs.

In identifying data the question of what should go into the directory should be asked. The answer is data that is read often and written little 

It is also important to ask what should not go into the directory. The answer is data that changes frequently Large and unstructured chunks of data designed for file systems ftp servers web servers or relational databases data that requires sophisticated database operations to be accessed and manipulated.

Portal management solutions based on a directory include the ability to create extended attribute columns in the schema. Extended attributes can serve a number of uses by applications. Two common examples are user preferences such as language and local time. Once the directory structure designed by the process above is in place the supply chain coordinator may need an application to allow users to manage their preferences and other data to be used by applications.

For each attribute category the supply chain coordinator decides to include in the directory store administration screens may be required to add modify or delete the attribute data.

Once the application functionality specified previously exists a new community management challenge presents itself. The question of who can access the new administrative features and what attributes they can update must be answered.

What makes this challenge much greater than managing privileges in Option 2 is that with the base configuration privilege models are more simplistic and for the most part reserved for administrator users. Now that application critical attribute data is being maintained by users themselves in a more distributed model it may be helpful to make sure that the privileges to access applications and data are distributed properly.

Default privileges defined by group type user type and creator privileges they are the intersection of these three sets of privileges what is common to all of them .

Allowable privileges creator privileges These privileges are those which the creator has but are not included in the users default privileges.

Default privileges are assigned to the user at creation time a trigger should be automatically fired the allowable privileges may be granted if the creator choose to. The user privileges can be modified later by a user with sufficient privileges. That modifier user can revoke any privilege no matter if he she has or does not have that privilege and can grant only the privileges he she has.

The administrative interface needs to be extended to allow for the addition of allowable features. The process by which default privileges may be assigned also needs to be customized in this approach. Once the more sophisticated privileges are in place the update preference process is enhanced to check for proper access level. illustrates a flow diagram for assigning default privileges.

Once this information is stored and updated in the user profile the application needs to update the current session. This requires that the session object be able to handle the attribute information so that it can be passed to applications that need it later another piece of work .

Finally though outside of the scope of the portal management solution the applications that may use the extended attribute information must be programmed to correctly receive the information and put in into its application session.

Another way to extend the security management solution to make administration easier is privilege templates. There should be privilege templates for each domain in the system. These focus on applications a certain type of user can access. For example certain functions are only for the supply chain ember users. If there are certain things a user type can perform making the administrator setup these privileges over and over again for each new user is a waste of time. Setting up a template for all users of that domain makes more sense. The domain privilege templates are created and maintained add delete privilege by admin users.

Throughout the community there are many users who share a similar job function. Some of these differ within a domain but some also are the same throughout the system. For example every group may have an administrator regardless of domain. In order to save time in user setup a user should be able to be assigned a role type that carries a certain number of privileges with it. The role may be used as a template to setup users or the role might actually become an entity that privileges are assigned to and whereby a user inherits those privileges by being attached to the role. Some roles may be setup for use across the system by the system administrator the domain where the role is used may bound these. Other roles might be setup in a domain or group depending on how much flexibility the supply chain coordinator decides to include in the solution.

The final piece to what a new user can be granted deals with the fact that a user can add only privileges that he she was granted with however he she can delete any privilege that the grantee template contains.

There should be a user interface for maintaining the tables where domain and role templates are stored. After a new domain or role is created in the system a UI page is needed that allows the creator to attach newly created templates of privileges to the new domain or role. The creator can grant only his her privileges.

Another feature the supply chain community asked for was a single place to view the activities their employees perform in supply chain applications. In option 1 this was not possible as there was not a single view of a user across applications. In option 2 there was single sign on and the infrastructure to capture some user information across applications but very little customization performed to take advantage of the infrastructure.

In option 3 two important functions are added. First development is performed to increase the number of events that are captured about the user. This includes integration to the third party ASP applications to retrieve a set of user initiated events. These events are either stored in the security solution logs or in the supply chain coordinator s database.

The second part of this development effort includes building online visibility to the events captured for a group s administrator. This function gives the distributed community administrators the tracking capabilities they have asked for. These online views and reports should allow a group admin to see activities both application access related and perhaps even user actions within an application depending on what the third party ASP applications can provide . There was also discussion during the workout sessions that the system might provide visibility for users within a company with possible views including all registered users from their company.

In a previous section the features requested by the supply chain community were detailed along with the functions those features imply. Table 20 shows whether functions are provided by this approach along with an explanation.

From the comparison chart this is a pretty comprehensive alternative. Still missing are the most complex community management items such as hierarchies and data publication across domains but most other items are supported by this alternative.

For option 3 the assumption is that the security management solution software provides more advanced administration features self administration improved session tracking and event capture detailed reporting and custom policy extensions. Table 21 shows a list of assumed functionality for the purpose of cost and level of effort estimation.

From a cost standpoint Option 3 assumes that Option 2 has been implemented. Therefore additional software license fees are not required. Additional hardware is probably not required unless the load on the directory requires a separate installation of the supply chain coordinator decides to implement a reverse proxy server.

The following is an estimated list of resources that may be required to install and configure the security management solution software develop custom administration and develop custom reports to provide the functionality in the foregoing table.

The supply chain coordinator has a very unique community with real world issues that defy standard organizational definitions. No two organizational structures or ownership arrangements are the same. Yet being able to map the real world may be useful for fully meeting the community s requirements without clumsy workarounds.

The following section describes several custom additions that could be developed to push out community management to end users and allow them to manage their web based applications in a way matching their real world business organization. Also presented is a way to dynamically manage the relationships between supplier distributors and retailers in place of a cross reference method that requires constant update for application data access.

Each of the following would be custom developed application. While they would integrate heavily with the portal management solution and directory structure in options 2 and 3 they would be stand alone applications that would run in their own environment.

Hierarchies are a way of representing real world structures inside of an application. The purpose is to provide a more flexible way to manage the relationships between entities and other entities entities and users and users and data. Hierarchies are very complex to implement especially in a many to many community such as the supply chain coordinator has. If implemented properly however they can provide group owners a way to manage their application and data controls that matches the way they see their own businesses and maps how they control functions in real life. This section attempts to lay out how hierarchies are implemented maintained and how they can be used to enhance privilege storage.

The first step in creating a hierarchy is to create domains. Domains are the different types of groups that may exist in the portal with each one requiring different business rules for privilege assignment. An application function is needed to add a domain or remove a domain as shown below.

Once domains exist the next step is to setup groups within a domain. An example is the supplier domain. There are many different supplier companies and each of these may have their own group to control data access rights even though they all share common application access rights. To technically describe groups under the top level domain the term node is used. Nodes can be single level in nature or built in n tiered structures with each node having a parent node. In the case of a top level group the parent node is the domain itself. An application function to add modify delete child nodes is required to add groups as shown in the diagram below.

Groups exist within a domain. Therefore no matter what roles are created within a group they are bounded by the privileges granted to a domain.

In a directory based security model LDAP or NT users typically belong to companies groups . In the move to n tiered hierarchies there is also a move from the directory used by the SSO product to a relational database. This is because referential integrity is required to take full advantage of and properly manage hierarchies. By only allowing top level groups not allowing an n tired hierarchy the hierarchies are easily synched to the companies in the directory. If the supply chain coordinator chooses to enable sub groups however users belong to nodes and not companies and the path to the top node of each hierarchy instance identifies the corresponding company in LDAP. An n tier hierarchy is shown below.

If n tiered hierarchies are enabled the management feature must also allow for nodes to be moved from one parent to another as well as the ability to take a node and all nodes attached below it and move them together. shows a process for hierarchy management in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.

In the initial stages all information distributed by the supply chain coordinator to suppliers and distributors may be packaged by the supply chain coordinator. For example in the pilot the supply chain coordinator maintains a list of stores served by a specific distributor. When a report runs it runs for all retailers associated in the cross reference table to that distributor. To make sure information is correct those cross reference tables must be up to date. This approach also means that the supply chain coordinator is in control of what data can be viewed by a distributor and there are very few controls over who within a distributor organization can view retailer information. The supply chain member has very little control over their data in this scenario and the supply chain coordinator has a very high management overhead in this data exchange.

To perform more complex data access control the supply chain coordinator may choose to implement linkages between organizational hierarchies. As described below hierarchies can be added to each domain The supply chain coordinator supplier distributor supply chain member retail manager to add application access flexibility. For data purposes there can be links between nodes of one hierarchy and another. The most common usage of this would be a distribution center to a store.

Example Looking at a large supply chain member and a distributor that serves them. A generic structure is shown in Table 22.

Each point in a hierarchy is a node . Each node has a number or value assigned to it. This NODE ID is numeric unique system wide and would enable the supply chain coordinator hierarchy system to clearly and unambiguous define in the application any location in the supply chain member supplier distributor or retail outlet manager hierarchy.

The node ids or attributes become important in privilege setup. For example initially a user named Joe might be part of the group Restaurants. In a normal association Joe would be able to see all data that belongs to his group. The access to data could be restricted in option 2 or 3 but that would have to be handled by the applications or through extended attributes with the actual store numbers in the portal management solution. There was not a concept of inherited data access or restricted data access through the use of nodes.

Now assume that Joe is really a field auditor in the west restaurant manager division. As the restaurant manager admin you want to setup Joe so that he can only access data for the West region and cannot see the other divisions data. In the database portion of the security management system the company id restaurant manager in the company id is replaced with a group id. Because the group id is a sub group of the top level restaurant manager node it can be associated back to the company id that is stored in the directory.

Because Joe now belongs to group and not group he can only see data for restaurants from his node in the hierarchy and downwards. Note Table 23.

Another case might be that while Joe works in the West Region he actually only audits restaurants in the Tempe Metropolitan area. The columns can be added to the privilege to include other information such as a node that further restricts data access. With the privilege below Joe can now only view order data for restaurants below node even though there are more restaurants under the scope of node . Note Table 24.

The concept of extending columns in the privilege store becomes very important when on organization has a requirement to grant access to applications and data to users in another group or another domain.

The requirement to grant access from one group to a user in another group comes from the complex ownership arrangements that the supply chain members have.

The supply chain members are the owners of the data retailer information . They can publish grant their privileges to users in other organizations. The design for this is that supply chain members publish data in their hierarchy by 

The grantor that belongs to 345 supply chain member node publishes the privilege to view order data to user Joe belonging to 123 supply chain member node. What Joe can see so far are the retailers the granter can see in his hierarchy R R R and R .

The grantor can narrow down the publishing by specifying a node in his hierarchy let us say node . At this point the user can see data for R R and R .

Just the node numbers are stored in the directory. When the user is authenticated and accessing applications that need a store list in order to properly enforce data access rules the custom application written in this alternative must access the hierarchies in the database. From the database the application translates the intersection of the node ids into a list of valid stores that the user may perform the granted functions. This retailer list is then returned as part of the header strong to the resource requested.

You could even make this more granular by adding attributes for state or zip code associated with the nodes especially the lowest node which is a retailer .

Publish any privilege a user has and my data span of control to users that need to perform actions for my retailers.

Publish all my privileges a user have and my data span of control to users that need to perform actions for my retailers mainly for equal partners .

A supply chain member can grant access to retailers that belong to their group or to groups downward their hierarchy. A user can see only items at retailer level if he she got privilege published to him her. The supply chain member nodes and retailer ids should not be mutually exclusive as a node can be specified but a retailer may also be specified.

Retailer ids and attributes should be mutual exclusive either one can be specified but not both. This is because attributes are restrictive so by default any store specified must also have that attribute as part of it.

The supply chain member does not publish data to users that belong to supplier or distributor hierarchy.

Suppliers or distributors can see data based on the retailers linked to their hierarchy without the supply chain member specifically publishing data assuming the application permission has been granted to the supplier distributor domain by the supply chain coordinator . There is no need for a supplier distributor to see another supplier distributor hierarchy data.

The supply chain members publish data to another supply chain member user only if the user is not in the same hierarchy with the grantor or if the user is in another branch of the hierarchy than the grantor.

A very complex customization of the directory attributes would be to bound all privileges by start and end dates. The reason behind this optional function is that retailers often change hands. It was expressed in the workout sessions that members may need to view historical data for a specific retailer from both the supplier distributor side as well as the supply chain member side even if they not currently own or serve that retailer. There are also legal requirements that may require this ability. Table 26 illustrates an example of this privilege.

As the number of attributes that need to be used by the application or translated into other information such as retailer numbers increases so does application load. There are significant impacts on application performance and ease of use as well as maintainability of both the portal management solution and the applications.

In an aspect the updating includes updating the first identification information to include the second identification information. In another aspect the updating includes updating a distributor assigned to the stores based on the comparison. In further aspect the first information includes a store identification number. In one aspect the registration is further updated based on the data. In an additional aspect the network includes the Internet.

The supply chain coordinator receives a load of updated retailer information from the retailer manager. This information is currently batch loaded into the SQL database and updates are made to tables matching retailers to suppliers distributors and supply chain members.

A desire is for the supply chain coordinator to automate this maintenance in the portal management solution as well. This is straight forward if the supply chain coordinator continues to use straight cross reference between retailers and suppliers distributors as the same tables may probably be accessed by the applications to determine data access in the application. But if hierarchies are used there may need to be a custom application written to apply the following business rules.

When a new retail outlet is added the application should check to see if that retailer already exists. If it does not a new retailer entity should be auto added to the proper group the supply chain member node.

Each time new retailer information in the address field arrives the application may compare the new information to the retailer address information to see if data has changed. If yes the retailer information is updated.

If the retailer is moved from a group node deleted or reassigned and it is the last retailer attached to a group node the group node and corresponding supply chain member should be auto deactivated.

Each time new retailer information arrives the retailer s group supply chain member information should be compared with the group supply chain member the retailer is already associated to. If it is different the retailer should be reassigned re linked to the appropriate group supply chain member node. The Auto add delete processes may run as appropriate.

One issue may be how to auto associate a retailer to the proper place in a node. In the design phase available data elements should be examined to see if it is possible. If not then there should be an unattached node not visible to applications outside of the hierarchy management. When the supply chain coordinator adds a retailer to a supply chain member that member could assign it to the proper hierarchy point through the distributed administration.

A second issue may be where to associate the new retailer to the distributor or supplier node. There may the ability to pull attributes from the information the supply chain coordinator puts in their database distribution center number or supplier ship from location . If an attempt is made to auto associate the new retailer to other domains beyond the supply chain member s a check process may be required to make sure the auto association is correct otherwise unauthorized data access could occur.

In a previous section the features requested by the supply chain coordinator s community were detailed along with the functions those features imply. Table 27 shows whether functions are provided by this approach along with an explanation.

Option 4 is the comprehensive community management solution. It requires a lot of customization a lot of which occurs outside of the SSO Portal Management solution. It does however meet all the functions specified by the supply chain community CTQs.

For option 4 the assumption is that the security management solution software provides hierarchies hierarchy management and other customizations detailed in this section. Table 28 is a list of assumed functionality for the purpose of cost and level of effort estimation 

From a cost standpoint Option 4 assumes that both option 2 and 3 are already implemented. Therefore additional software license fees are not required for security management software. Additional hardware is probably required to support the heavy application and database requirements for hierarchies and their use.

The following is an estimated list of resources that may be required to install and configure the security management solution software develop the custom community management applications and program custom data structures to provide the functionality in the table above.

The supply chain coordinator can host the web portal itself co locate the portal servers at an ISP offering co location services or completely outsource the portal management solution network and servers to a managed service provider.

From a network view the following details best practice for configuration of network servers for the portal.

One major issue may be managing a mission critical network environment where users can execute transactions. The choice of ASP providers must also be a consideration.

A third option is to outsource all port router network and platform management. This is called managed services. There is a difference between managing up to the platform OS and the actual portal management solution.

The options for managed services to the platform level are the same players. Again Level 3 is the only large national player in the Miami market. They do not offer managed services on their own but have a partner program to provide these services. The actual partner for the southern region would need to be confirmed but it is probably the same company that provides this service in the mid Atlantic region named AiNET. A company like AiNET would not have knowledge of the portal management solution itself but would manage everything else from a security view including attacks against the network and the machines.

The next level of managed service includes actually operating and configuring the portal management solution. Companies in this class have resources already trained in the portal management solution and can take ownership of delivering the software and operating it for a community. Each provider has a number of partners in this area GE Global Exchange Services is one of these companies. GXS provides managed Netegrity solutions along with others. Securant has many system integrator partners though it is hard to tell who specializes in hosting and operating their solutions.

Many of the applications that may sit behind the portal may be developed and operated by other organizations. The following details some recommendations for applications built on the NT platform using Microsoft framework and for evaluating ASP provided applications security.

The new technological infrastructure and its associated electronic reporting and feedback systems equips retailer management with accurate timely and previously unavailable information from the Supply Chain on sales marketing and other performance indicators allow Supply Chain management to fully engage in managing supply and distribution processes and channels toward identified and agreed strategic objectives provide franchisees and retailers with the Supply Chain information they need to operate efficiently and make effective management decisions minimally impacts the resources of Supply Chain management.

With Supply Chain management assuming full responsibility for managing the fundamentals of the Supply Chain system Supply Chain participants are strategically positioned to focus on the six business priorities that have been identified operational excellence boosting sales growth focusing resources discovering the essence of the Brand image transformation and revitalizing franchisee relations.

This section illustrates a Supply System according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Accordingly illustrates a graphical user interface for generating cost system components. The basic components of the cost system are Items FOB points Supplier Sites and Distribution Centers. To add to or modify a cost system component the relevant component is selected from the Supply menu. Then New is selected from selection screen . See .

The information entered for each Item FOB has many implications throughout the purchasing automation systems. The values are used on many of the reports provided to Suppliers Distributors and Board Members as well as being an integral part in Bid and Least Cost calculations. The following list defines several of the fields of the FOB window. Self explanatory columns are omitted.

The process for adding FOB points is essentially the same as adding Items. In this case Supplier Sites is selected from the Supply System main menu then New on the selection screen. illustrates a window for adding an FOB point. In the Site Name field the name of the site is entered. One standard naming convention for a supplier site is SUPPLIER NAME CITY STATE. The Site Role field identifies the role of the site. Only sites that have been marked with a role of FOB Shipping Point or Corporate FOB Point are available to the purchasing systems when building cost matrices creating Bids etc.

The Supplier should be added to the system before identifying the FOB points. In many cases the Suppliers headquarters is also an FOB point. These records will be identified with a site role of Corporate FOB Point . See below for a further explanation of Site roles.

In one aspect of the present invention the items may be defined utilizing an item identifier a category and a rank. In another aspect the set of supplier sites may be determined utilizing on an association between the definition of the items and the supplier sites. In an additional aspect the set of supplier sites may be capable of supplying the defined items. In a further aspect the supplier sites may be defined utilizing a name and a role identifier. In an additional aspect the items are defined the supplier site selected and the distribution center determined utilizing a network.

Once the basic components of the cost system have been created the matrices can either be manually created or can be generated by the Least Cost system after completion of analysis. See the section entitled Creating the Cost Matrices below for a detailed explanation of this option. 

The primary purpose of a matrix is to identify the source and destination for the product in question. In this example the Ameriserve Denver Distribution Center DC will be supplied by Tyson s Greenforest Arkansas FOB point.

At this point the Distribution Center DC Price notification can be generated. This communicates to the DC s their FOB points selected and relevant pricing and is generated by selecting the Price Notification option from the Options menu or the Notification toolbar button . Supplier confirmation is provided with the contract for all items except Beef.

For example since beef pricing is changed much more frequently than other products their contracts cover multiple cost matrices. They have a separate DC Notification and Supplier Confirmation report which is only enabled when working with beef items.

The beef reports are generated in letter format and automatically combine all beef items into the same report.

In one embodiment of the present invention reports for each of the items may be generated utilizing the cost model. As a further aspect at least one of the reports may be for a plurality of the items. In one aspect the cost model identifies a source and a destination of the item. In another aspect a plurality of the cost models may be available for being associated with the item. In a further aspect the item may be identified and the cost model associated with the item utilizing a network.

The Price Notification reports discussed in the previous section provide the communication link with the DC s whereas the Supplier reports are generated within the contracts system.

In order to link contracts to cost matrices as discussed in the previous section the relevant items must first be associated with the contract. An item selection screen is accessed such as by selecting a New Item button as shown in . The item selection screen works in the same manner as the selection screens discussed in the section on Creating Cost Components .

Preferably Item Contract associations cannot overlap in other words there cannot be two contracts for the same items with a Supplier at the same time. The system will automatically prevent creation of this situation.

The present invention also generates several reports. A Generate button shown in links to Microsoft Word and populates required fields with the contract information. Once created a contract cannot be overwritten by the system. Further contracts can only be removed by an administrative department.

The Exhibit A report shows all detail added when the Item FOB records is created. It is important in that it identifies the relationship between the Supply Chain Coordinator s item and the Supplier s item and also ensures that the information in the system is current and correct.

The Exhibit B always retrieves the latest finalized matrix for each item. If the contract has not been linked or the relevant matrix finalized they should be done prior to generating this report.

In most cases the contract term will correspond to the start and end dates of the linked matrix. However if the contract will outlast the matrix the screen of is presented. The various columns include 

Since the Exhibit B will publish the term of the pricing the choice of end date becomes very important.

In some cases there may be a need to publish new pricing and volumes during the term of the contract. Selection of the Replacement Exhibit B menu item accommodates this process. See . The replacement Exhibit B differs from the standard Exhibit B only in that it provides a section at the end of the report for signatures.

Exhibit C generated upon selecting the Exhibit C button of lists product routing for each lane and any minimum order quantities if applicable whether the product is sent in full truckloads full truckloads with a minimum order quantity less than truckload or for re distribution.

In one aspect of the present invention the contract may be identified utilizing a start date an end date an execution date and payment terms. In one embodiment the contract may be generated by populating a template with information associated with the contract. In another aspect items capable of being associated with the contract are displayed. In a further aspect the contract may be identified and the contract associated with the item utilizing a network. In such an aspect the network may include the Internet.

The proposal system has been designed to allow quick and easy creation of a generic proposal for any item s and supplier s within the Supply System. By centralizing the creation and storage of the data an online record of all current and historical proposals is enabled. The proposal system is also tightly integrated with the Least Cost analysis system.

Data Entry allows a user to enter or select all information for generating a complete proposal. Data Entry includes entering general proposal information i.e. proposal name buyer name due date contract begin date and end date items suppliers restaurants served usage information selecting cost component templates and updating Microsoft Word template documents. Most of the information above will be generated from data within the Supply System but the system will allow the user to change some information when necessary.

Reporting After data has been entered the proposal can be generated and printed. In the reporting module of the proposal process a user can update specific documents for a supplier print any of the reports included in the proposal and or generate the entire proposal.

By following the flow of the tabs on the proposal window d see Figure d the user will be guided through the proposal process. When enough data is entered to continue on to the next step in the proposal process more tabs will be enabled. For example when the user has completed entering information on the Main Info tab the Items Suppliers DCs and FOB Price tabs will become enabled.

The goal of the proposal system is to provide a way to generate a proposal in a more time efficient manner while at the same time centralizing the storage of proposals and allowing integration of the proposal with the Least Cost Analysis system.

A new Proposal can be created in either of two ways. The first and probably the most simple method is to build the proposal from scratch. Referring to to create a proposal from scratch select Proposal from the Supply menu. Then select Edit New to open an existing Proposal or create a new proposal. After selecting the Edit New menu option the standard query screen is presented. Select New on the standard query screen to begin generating the proposal.

The second method uses the New Using Previous feature of the present invention which will create an entire copy of a previous proposal not including any documents and allow the user to make any necessary modifications. To being the process select the New Using Previous menu item to copy an existing Proposal into a new Proposal. Note that this feature is similar to the Cost Matrix feature of the same name.

The first tab visible on the Bid Proposal window when it is opened is the Main Info tab . The Main Info tab is where general information for this proposal is entered. The main info tab on the Bid Proposal window shows general information comments and dates associated with this bid. Such information includes 

After entering all of the information on the Main Info tab the user can move to the next tabs Items Suppliers and DCs . These tabs are where the creation of a proposal begins. Although these elements are added on three separate tabs in this description the methods used to include them are consistent.

These tabs are Drag and Drop enabled the user can select any of the items found and by clicking on the relevant item and dragging it to the right it is now included in the analysis. By the same token dragging the selected item to the left will remove it from the proposal. The buttons between the search and selected areas can also can move the selections. Button moves whatever has been highlighted on the left and includes it in the proposal. Button moves all items retrieved and includes them in the proposal. Button removes everything previously included in the proposal. Button removes only the highlighted selections from the proposal. Further multi select using CTRL Click and double clicking on any Item to move it are preferably also supported.

After a search for the desired item s has been performed another search can be performed by clicking the Query button and entering new search criteria.

It is important to note that in order to include any of the elements in the proposal they must have previously been entered in the Supply System. The Supplier selection tab retrieves all active and un approved Suppliers that match the search criteria and have at least one active contact. Inactive elements should not appear as a relevant selection in any of the tabs.

Since the DCs are generally consistent between proposals a complete list of all active DCs is retrieved and then the user simply selects the relevant one or in most cases presses the button to move them all to the right.

When the user leaves any of the tabs for the first time the new elements are propagated to all dependent tabs. For example if a new Item is added that implies new usage information.

An association between a worksheet and each item must be generated before continuing to the next tab. Once all FOB price components are selected the remaining tabs are enabled.

The selected worksheets can be printed along with the bid and can be viewed on the Template tab. For more information on the FOB Price Component Worksheet see the Reporting section of this document.

The Proposal mechanism for estimating usage functions in almost exactly the same manner as in the Least Cost Analysis System. It is comprised of two tabs the DC Rest tab is used for estimating restaurant growth by DC and the Usage tab to estimate same store or item growth. The values from the first tab are used in the Usage tab to determine the projected usage. For more information on general processing in these tabs see the section entitled Distribution Center Usage.

For example if the two 2 week truckload weight estimate two week usage gross weight is less than the system weight default 48 000 LBS OR the two week volume estimate two week usage item cube is less than system cube default 3000 CFT for any DC an LTL worksheet is generated and RDC records will appear on the Truckload Freight Worksheet. The exact gross weight and cube will be requested on the Item Worksheet. Realize that the total gross weight for a truck is 45 000 lbs. LTL rates can be requested for any lane with less than 48 000 lbs. to avoid having to go back to the Supplier for additional rates. Optimal Product Routing in this example uses 43 500 lbs. gross weight of product which accounts for pallet weight. For a detailed look at the components and processing of the Usage Estimator see the section of the same name.

In one aspect of the present invention the bid proposal may be generated utilizing templates. In another aspect the information may be selected from a displayed list of available information. In a further aspect items capable of being associated with the bid proposal may also be displayed. In such an aspect the information may further include usage information associated with the items. In an additional aspect the information may be received utilizing a network.

In order to create a proposal the user first edits template documents and then selects which reports will be included in the proposal. illustrates a Templates button which calls the Template window shown in .

The Proposal consists of two types of reports Microsoft Word and Coordinator Supply. Microsoft Word reports are formatted and some are editable within Word whereas the Supply System reports are generated by the Supply System but are not editable. The following is a list of reports available in the Proposal System and how they are generated.

The proposal system allows editing of a Microsoft Word template document which is then used to create the actual document that will be included in the proposal. illustrates a window displayed upon selection of the Templates tab. A drop down list box shows which template documents can be edited. As shown in the available templates include the Cover Letter and Price Component Worksheet. To start Microsoft Word and edit the selected template the user double clicks on the document in the window.

Once Microsoft Word has started the user can edit the template document to fit his or her needs. The proposal Cover Letter will be used herein as an example in order to demonstrate how to use the template documents. The template bid cover letter is the basic cover letter used to create supplier specific cover letters.

Only generic changes that apply to all suppliers should be made in the template. When the proposal is created this document will be copied to all the suppliers and contacts associated with this proposal. The user will be able to edit a supplier specific cover letter later in the proposal process.

When editing of the cover letter ahs been completed the document is saved by selecting File Update from Microsoft Word s menus as shown in . Now the user may return to the Supply System and continue with the proposal process.

Before creating the proposal the user is allowed to select which reports should be included. is an illustration of the page presented upon selection of the Create Bid tab. To design customize the appropriate proposal and select reports the user checks or unchecks the appropriate boxes. When the user is satisfied with the selections click the Create Bid button on the toolbar. See .

The present invention then creates all of the documents needed to print this proposal. The user can view any of these reports by making the appropriate selections in the drop down list boxes shown in . The user also has ability to view any of the proposal reports one at a time and for any specific supplier.

The proposal system allows a certain degree of flexibility when it comes to printing the proposal. The user can either print out one report for a specific supplier the currently selected report shown on the window or print the entire proposal. When printing the entire proposal the documents will be collated by supplier. Microsoft Word documents will be printed first for all suppliers followed by the Coordinator generated reports. The different printing mechanisms can be controlled by the buttons on the toolbar shown in . For example the Print button Prints the currently selected report on the window. The Print Bid button prints the entire proposal.

This will print all of the reports that have been checked off on the Create Bid tab only choose this option if the user is sure that he or she is ready to print the entire proposal. The proposal is now ready to be sent out. When proposals are returned the information can now easily be moved from the proposal process into the Least Cost Analysis.

In one aspect of the present invention the proposal may be generated utilizing templates. In another aspect the graphical user interface may be displayed utilizing a network browser. In a further aspect the proposal may be editable. In an additional aspect the proposal may be read only. In yet another aspect the proposal may include a bid proposal for goods to be shipped from a supplier to an outlet.

A Least Cost Analysis can be created in either of three ways. The first and probably the most cumbersome method requires building the analysis from scratch. The second method integrates the Bid proposal selections and creates the basis for a new analysis. Finally the New Using Previous feature can be used which will create an entire copy of a previous analysis version and allow the user to make any necessary modifications.

After selecting the Least Cost Toolbar button see the user is prompted with the standard query screen shown in . The New button is selected. The details of the actual Analysis features are covered in a section below.

The New Using Previous option is selected from the menu shown in . Similar to the Cost Matrix feature of the same name the user can make a complete copy of a previous Analysis version. However unlike the Cost system there is no requirement that Analysis dates cannot overlap.

Referring to the Bid Integration feature since a lot of the information selected by the user in the Bid Proposal is also relevant to a Least Cost Analysis the present invention provides the ability to integrate the Bid information in the analysis.

To use the Bid Integration feature the user selects the New option as above and the first column on the Analysis Tab will provide an alphabetical list of all Bid Proposals in the system. This will copy the Items Distribution Centers DC Usage and usage related information such as same store and restaurant growth estimates from the Bid. The user can change the Bid selection or remove it by selecting None from the drop down list box shown in .

In one aspect of the present invention the selection may be received utilizing a network. In such an aspect the network may include the Internet. In another aspect the analysis may be a least cost analysis. In a further aspect the analysis may be capable of being accessed via a network based interface.

When the analysis tab is selected the version button shown in is displayed on the toolbar. Unlimited versions of an analysis can be created simply by pressing the button. illustrates a verification window that appears upon selection of the version button.

The name assigned to the new version should be representative of the variance being tested in order to easily differentiate between versions later. A discussion of the methods provided for completing version comparisons is presented in the section entitled Solving and reviewing the Solution.

Items FOB DCs and Usage information are not considered to be version dependent and hence this information cannot be changed once a second version of an Analysis has been created. However a variety of methods of excluding this information from consideration between versions is provided by the present invention.

In one aspect of the present invention the additional version of the analysis may be named in accordance with a variance associated with the additional version. In another aspect the request may include the selection of an icon on the graphical user interface. In a further aspect the analysis may be a least cost analysis. In an additional aspect the request may be received utilizing a network. In yet another aspect the parameters of the additional version may be capable of being changed utilizing a plurality of fields on the graphical user interface.

Although Items FOBs and DCs are added on three separate tabs in the Analysis the methods used to include them are consistent. depicts a tab page for adding and removing FOBs from an analysis.

The left side of each tab is the search and selection area. It functions in the same manner as the rest of the system in that a search string is entered and a search button is selected and similar names to the search string will be retrieved. For example in the case shown in FIG. d all FOBs beginning with DOP would be retrieved.

These tabs are Drag and Drop enabled allowing selection of any of the matches found and by clicking on the relevant match and dragging it to the right it is now included in the analysis. The buttons between the search and selected areas can also move the selections similar to the manner discussed above with reference to . Multi select using CTRL CLICK and double clicking on any Item to move it are also supported. It is important to note that in order to include any of the elements in the analysis they must have previously been added to the system.

The FOB selection tab retrieves all active and un approved FOBs that match the search criteria. Inactive elements will never appear as a relevant selection in any of the tabs.

Since the DCs are generally consistent between each analysis a complete list of all active DCs is retrieved by default and the user selects the relevant DCs or in most cases presses the button to move them to the right.

As shown in which illustrates a portion of the Item tab page the Item tab has an additional editable column for the Item conversion factor.

When leaving either of the tabs for the first time the system propagates the new elements to all dependent tabs. For example if a new FOB is added that implies new pricing lanes capacity etc. will also be added and the relevant tabs for each information group are updated.

In one aspect of the present invention the selected parameters may include a case cube cases per truckload and or a gross weight. In another aspect the changes to the parameters may be updated in a database. In such an aspect the changes to the parameters may be updated utilizing a network. In one aspect the network may include the Internet. Additionally the changes to the parameters may be updated in response to the selection of an icon of the graphical user interface.

The remaining information is also important however it is not a factor in determining a Least Cost solution. It is stored separately from the Item FOB Cost information so that cases per truckload or case weights can be used without effecting the data that is currently considered production.

At the point the analysis has been completed and a version that will become the production model has been selected. The Cost information is updated by selecting the Update button on the toolbar. See .

Select the Update button and the present invention creates any Item FOB combinations that do not exist in the Cost system and update any existing combinations with the information the user may have entered to complete the analysis.

In one aspect of the present invention the selected supply chain components may include supplier sites distributor sites and or items. In another aspect the results may be selected for inclusion in the supply chain analysis utilizing icons. In such an aspect the results may also be selected one at a time for inclusion in the supply chain analysis utilizing a first icon. The results may also be selected all at once for inclusion in the supply chain analysis utilizing a second icon. In a further aspect the supply chain components may include items while the graphical user interface includes a field for entry of a conversion factor. In an additional aspect the results may be selected for inclusion in the supply chain analysis utilizing a drag and drop feature.

The system supports capacity constraints at two levels. Both FOB minimum requirements and capacities can be set. They can also be set at the Supplier level.

As mentioned above once a second version of an analysis has been created it is not possible to remove Items FOBs or DCs. However a Supplier or individual FOB points can be excluded on the Capacity tab.

In one aspect of the present invention terms of a contract associated with the supplier sites may also be identified utilizing the graphical user interface. In another aspect the supplier sites may be conditionally excluded utilizing a toggle button. In a further aspect the supplier sites may be conditionally excluded separately for different versions. In an additional aspect the minimum value and the maximum value of the capacity levels may be determined utilizing a network. In such an aspect the minimum value and the maximum value of the capacity levels may also be determined utilizing TCP IP protocol.

On the analysis tab the option of selecting the pricing method being for this analysis version is presented. Depending on the selection previously made the Price tab will be used for FOB or FOB Freight pricing or the Price Dlvd tab for delivered pricing. The present invention also provides the ability to factor volume pricing into the analysis.

Two forms of volume based pricing are supported in the Least Cost system Supplier volume and FOB volume. They are mutually exclusive in that by version there can be only one type of pricing.

In many cases the Suppliers may not be as concerned about the volume awarded to each individual FOB point as to the overall volume awarded across all their FOB points.

It is also possible to have the new solver determine the Least Cost when the pricing is quoted on a delivered basis. Once a pricing method of Delivered is selected on the analysis tab the Price Dlvd tab is enabled. shows a Delivered Pricing screen .

Pricing is entered in the same manner as FOB pricing and as in FOB pricing the user must provide a price for all Items on a lane if at least one price is entered. Lanes can be excluded simply by providing no prices for those lanes.

In one aspect of the present invention the received pricing schemes may include at least one of supplier site pricing volume pricing and or delivered pricing. In another aspect the received pricing schemes may include all of supplier site pricing volume pricing and delivered pricing. In a further aspect pricing information entered in the pricing fields may be utilized in a supply chain analysis. In an additional aspect the selection may be received utilizing a network. In even another aspect the selection may be received utilizing an icon of the graphical user interface.

The Least Cost mechanism for estimating usage functions operates in the same manner as in the Bid System. It is comprised of two tabs the DC Rest tab is used for estimating restaurant growth by DC and the Usage tab to estimate same store or item growth. The values from the first tab are used in the Usage tab to determine the projected usage. A more detailed explanation of the usage calculations is included in the section entitled Usage Estimator below.

By editing the DC Item Growth percentage or overall Item Growth the projected usage can be manipulated to the desired level. The user can also directly edit the projected usage amount which will adjust the DC Item Growth amount accordingly. Usage estimates calculated by the system are always in cases hence if the user is entering pricing volume or capacity constraints in any other unit these values should be modified appropriately.

Note that the previous usage amount is not used in the calculation of the projected usage amount. It is used as a guide only. In the example shown in no overall Item growth percentage was used but chicken patty s were projected to grow by 4.00 at the Ameriserve in Omaha and 5.00 at the Ameriserve in Plymouth.

In one aspect of the present invention the growth value may include a restaurant growth percentage. As a further aspect the projected parameter amount may include a projected restaurant count. In another aspect the growth value may include an item growth percentage. In a further aspect the projected parameter amount may include a projected item usage amount. In an additional aspect the projected parameter includes an editable default value.

In the Least Cost system the ability is provided to override any solution that the solver determines and force certain lanes. The overrides can be established before the solver runs.

It also a good habit to run a least cost version without any lane restrictions so that an estimation of the relative cost of forcing or excluding lanes can be readily determined.

It may also be necessary to ensure that certain lanes are forced regardless of whether the lane assignment will prevent the least cost from begin achieved. is a depiction of a Forcing Lanes window .

In this example the Required option has been selected for the lane from J. R. Simplots Hermiston FOB to Post Albuquerque. The solver will allocate this lane prior to beginning its optimization calculations hence ensuring that the remaining lane allocations will still minimize the total cost given the lane requirement.

In a multi source problem lanes can still be forced although without adjusting the supporting input the FOB may also receive another DC. For example if a user wishes a lane to be forced but not allow the relevant FOB to get another DC the user can simply make the FOB s maximum the DC s usage.

If the product is being single sourced 1 FOB 1 DC a lane cannot be forced twice. For example if a user attempted to also force the Lamb FOB to Post Albuquerque the message screen shown in would get the following message.

The third Lane Restriction option is marked as Solver in the previous example and simply means that the lane is available to the solver as a potential lane in the least cost solution.

The Honor TL Rate boxes are used to specify whether or not the Supplier will Honor Truckload TL rates for shipments that are not a Full Truckload. See the section below entitled Optimal Product Routing.

In one aspect of the present invention it may be determined whether a supplier site has been excluded from the supply chain analysis so that the lane is involved in the supply chain analysis based on the determination. In another aspect the lane may be allocated prior to the supply chain analysis upon the lane restriction of the distribution centers being designated as required. In a further aspect the lane may be excluded during the supply chain analysis upon the lane restriction of the distribution centers being designated as excluded. In event another aspect the lane may be included during the supply chain analysis upon the lane restriction of the distribution centers being designated as to be solved. In an additional aspect the designation may be received utilizing a network.

In the example shown in O.K. Foods has quoted LTL rates from their Fort Smith FOB to ProSource Atlanta and Burlington. All quotes are in CWT hundred weight hence the Atlanta rate is 165 1.10 150 and the Burlington rate is 400 The LTL minimum of 400 is not satisfied by the quoted rate of 180 150 1.2 . The Optimal Product Routing OPR process will determine which rate to use based on its estimates of two week usage and compare the basket cost with both TL and RDC rates to determine the optimal routing. The entire OPR is discussed in detail in the section below entitled Optimal Product Routing.

Preferably as projected usage estimates are adjusted on the Usage tab rows will be added and deleted to this tab when relevant.

In one aspect of the present invention a suggested value may be displayed in an output field. In an additional aspect the suggested value may be received from a supply chain manager utilizing a network. In another aspect the truckload freight value may be converted to a case value. In a further aspect the truckload freight value may be converted to a freight rate value. In an additional aspect the truckload freight value may be received utilizing a network.

In one aspect of the present invention the user action includes the selection of an icon. In another aspect the region may be user defined. In a further aspect a site role of each of the distribution centers may also be displayed utilizing the graphical user interface. In even another aspect the graphical user interface may be displayed utilizing a network. In an additional aspect the graphical user interface may be a browser based interface.

One of the major features in the least cost system is the Optimal Product Routing OPR feature. Because the present invention can factor Truckload RDC and LTL lanes into the least cost analysis the OPR engine will automatically determine the optimal routing prior to passing the data to the solver. OPR is automatically run prior to running the solver but can also be run at any time using the Routing button on the toolbar. The Routing button is shown in .

Optimal Product Routing is the process of determining for each lane in an analysis the lowest cost routing Full Truckload TL LTL RDC for the Market Basket of Product. The capability is built directly into the Least Cost system.

OPR processing includes determining two week usage as well as determining available routing information.

Regarding two week usage the weight and cube of product shipped during a two week period determines the possible routing types. Lanes with either a two week weight of more than the amount specified in the analysis typically 43 500 lbs. and a two week cube of more than 3 000 Cubic Feet will only travel TL. Those with less non truckload may also travel LTL and in the case of Dry product may also travel RDC. Two week weight usage is determined for all lanes included in the current version of the analysis.

When determining available routing information OPR finds the TL LTL and RDC information available for each lane and identifies incomplete or missing Freight information. It is important to gather freight quotes on all applicable routing types. For example a Supplier may only quote an LTL or RDC freight for a non truckload lane yet due to the nature of the load it may cost less to ship the product with a standard truckload rate.

Consider a lane which costs 1 000 to ship for a product which normally has 1 000 Cases per Truckload. Please refer to Table 29 below. If usage warranted a Full Truckload the freight per case would be 1 1 

Now assume that the two week usage for this lane is only 500 cases. The 1 000 Supplier quote may imply either of the following 

In order to ensure the lowest pricing Logistics recommends requesting all relevant freight information from Suppliers. OPR will not continue if any lanes are Incomplete. OPR can however at user request continue even though the status of certain lanes are Optional. Realize however that not requesting freight quotes on all applicable routing types may actually inadvertently place a Supplier at a competitive disadvantage. The Supply Chain Coordinator may award business based on Landed Cost which includes freight. Performing a Least Cost analysis with missing freight information may yield inappropriate lane awards.

This information is available on the Solution Tab of the Least Cost analysis under Optimal Product Routing Reports . More information on these reports can be found in the following section.

The Least Cost system operates on a Market Basket concept for determining per case unit and total shipment cost for all routings. It considers all Items shipping on a particular lane in the relevant Unit Case Pound Ounces on which the analysis is based. For all routing types provided OPR determines the Total Shipment amount for the entire usage specified and the Unit Shipment amount required to ship a Unit of product.

Optimal Product Routing takes into account all of the available freight routing information and determines the lowest cost method of shipping the Market Basket of product for each lane. In the event of multiple routing types having identical shipment costs OPR is decided in the following order of preference TL TLMIN LTL and RDC Dry shipments only .

Winning routing types are chosen on a lane by lane basis. When considering all lanes however this may not always be feasible. Certain lanes may be considered an RDC Override and Optimal Product Routing will determine the best routing excluding the RDC rates for these lanes. Presented below are two examples of this 

Note that the above is not feasible. There is no FOB that can service all of the DC s via the Prosource RDC.

As with the Least Cost Analysis OPR is calculated on a per Unit basis. As a last step OPR populates a case freight table which is used to create Cost Matrices once an analysis is complete. All of this information is kept in the system for enhanced analysis by the Logistics department.

In one aspect of the present invention the lowest cost routing scheme may be selected from a group of schemes that includes less than truckload carriers LTL regional distribution centers RDC and full truckloads FL . In another aspect the lowest cost routing scheme may be determined automatically prior to performing the supply chain analysis. In a further aspect a report reflecting the supply chain analysis may also be outputted. In an additional aspect the lanes may be identified utilizing a network. In yet another aspect results of the supply chain analysis may be outputted utilizing a browser based interface.

Once all the required information has been entered the problem can be solved from any of the tabs by selecting the Solve button shown in . The processing time will vary depending on the complexity of the problem and the quantity of the data that is being passed to the solver.

The report generator for the least cost system operates in the same manner as the report generator in the Utilities menu of the Supply System.

The Least Cost system has several reports available to analyze and view the solution generated by the solver. These reports fall under the following categories.

Note that data on individual tabs can be printed using the print option on the toolbar for that specific tab.

The present invention also allows a user to retrieve Comparison Reports. The example below will retrieve the Invoice FOB Comparison Report no conversion . Note that the term conversion refers to whether the report should show the price information in the analysis units ex pounds pours or convert the price information to cases. If the analysis was performed in cases then with and without conversion will be the same.

First the Comparison Reports report type is selected from the Report Type drop down list. After selecting the Comparison Reports report type the Report Name should appear as shown in the Report Selection window of . Next the report is selected from the Report name drop down. In this example Invoice FOB Detail Comparison no conversion is selected from the report name drop down list . See .

Upon selection of the report name the appropriate parameter entry fields shown in are enabled in the lower portion of the screen. As shown in this report allows selection of an item multiple versions of the current analysis using CTRL Click and whether to include the latest finalized cost matrix for the current item in the comparison.

In the example above for HASH BROWNS the solution for two versions and the latest finalized cost matrix will be compared.

After the correct parameters have been chosen the report can be prepared for output to the user. Clicking on the Retrieve button on the toolbar will retrieve this report and open a window so the user can view or print the data. A Retrieve button is shown in .

The process is the same for any report a user wishes to view. The only difference is the parameters that can be selected.

In one aspect each of the supply chain analyses may include a separate version of a single supply chain analysis. In another aspect the results may include cost information. In a further aspect the supply chain analyses may be selected utilizing a network. In such an aspect the supply chain analyses may be selected utilizing TCP IP protocol.

Since the solver input routing and solutions are already stored in the system to generate cost matrices the user simply has to identify the version from which he or she wishes to create the matrices and select the Cost button on the toolbar. illustrates a Cost button.

If the system detects any matrices in the system which cause a conflict a list of those matrices is output. Preferably the user can only overwrite an existing matrix if the dates are the same as in the analysis and the existing matrix has not been finalized. The matrix that is created by the least cost system can be edited as normal and is created un finalized.

The present invention automatically generates both inbound and outbound RDC lanes to ProSource and Chicago Consolidated when the user inputs a command to create or preview the cost matrices.

In a preferred embodiment the solver is designed to restrict each RDC to have only one FOB point. Hence the cost matrix will generate one inbound lane to either RDC and automatically populate the outbound lanes with the relevant Contract and Invoice FOB based on the landed cost to the RDC plus markup and the relevant outbound freight.

If volume pricing is used the sum of the awards across all RDC lanes that the solver selects can be used to determine the relevant price.

The Bid Proposal and Least Cost systems both have a Usage Estimator module which provides a sophisticated mechanism for projecting product case usage by DC for a particular period. The Usage Estimator takes into account for each DC the following 

The Usage Estimator is made up of two pieces DC Restaurant Information DC Rest and Usage information Usage . In order to determine the projected product case usage the system must first calculate the Projected Average Restaurant Count so the DC Restaurant portion of the Usage Estimator will be discussed first.

Regarding the DC Restaurant Information a Current Restaurant Count is provided monthly by the DC s in the form of Distributor Reported Landed Cost. This information verified by Finance for Patronage Dividend purposes provides an accurate monthly snapshot of Restaurant counts by DC. The Usage Estimator uses the most current month of information available for each DC.

Also provided with the DC Restaurant Information is a Restaurant Growth Percent Average report which specifies the overall average increase decrease in restaurant coverage that each DC will experience for the length of the Contract Period in question. Consider the following example A DC currently services 100 Restaurants. At the end of the 1 year pricing the DC will be servicing 110 Restaurants. The Projected Average Restaurant Count would be 110 100 2 105. The Restaurant Growth Percent in this case is 105 100 100 or 5 .

The Usage Information provided includes Previous Case Usage. This includes the actual number of cases sold by this DC during the previous period. Each month the Supply Chain Coordinator receives Product Sales statistics from each of the DC s. This information contains case sales of each Distributor s Item along with the number of Restaurants that product was sold to during the month. The Previous Case Usage number itself is not used directly to calculate Projected Usage as it would not allow manipulation of DC Served information. This information is available under Sales Inv Distributor Sales from within the Supply System.

Previous Period usage information is determined by the latest information available from the DC s. For example assume that on December 1 a Bid for a Contract Period from January to June will be completed. At this point the system would have probably only received complete DC information through October. Since the Contract Period is 6 months the Previous Case Usage would report usage for the latest 6 month period of DC Sales information May thru October . This is considered the Previous Period.

The Average Units sold per Restaurant Month includes the average number of cases per month of product sold by a DC to the Restaurants it services for those restaurants that receive product during the month. Remember not all Restaurants will receive each product during each month. This figure unlike the Previous Period information is based on the latest complete 12 month rolling average of DC Sales information.

A Projected Average Restaurant Count is calculated by multiplying the Current Restaurant Count by the Average Restaurant Growth Percent. This number is manipulated on the DC Rest tab.

A Product Growth Percent can also be calculated. The Usage Estimator allows the user to effect Projected Usage via a Product Growth Percent. For example BKC may estimate a 5 jump in sales for a particular product during the length of the Contract Period due to national promotions product mix changes etc.

The Usage Estimator takes into account the fact that a particular Item is not necessarily sold to all Restaurants that a DC services. Some items are purchaser s options others such as sausage patties come in different sizes. Even an Item such as the Whopper will not be sold to 100 of a DC s Restaurants each month due to mid month store openings and closings. Coverage Factor is calculated by dividing the number of Restaurants a Product was sold to by Restaurant Count during that Period. For example if a DC Services 100 Restaurants during a month and sold SAUSAGE 1.5 PATTIES to 50 of them this Item would have a Coverage Factor of 50 100 or 50 . Because of the difficulty of collecting each Invoice a Restaurant receives the DC s provide a monthly report of the number of cases sold and the number of Restaurants the product was sold to.

Realize that zero growth will still give a higher Projected Usage. It s important to remember that the Previous usage is based on a changing Restaurant base. For example assume that a DC last year started with 100 Restaurants and ended up with 110 and that the Average Units Per Month was 10. This DC would have sold an average of 1050 units per month the Average Restaurant Count is 105 . Notice that even if no Restaurant or Sales growth occurs the next year the Projected Usage will be higher than 1050 because of the fact that there are 110 Restaurants at the start 110 10 1100 .

The process of estimating usage is user friendly providing DC level information with user input adjustments for Restaurant and Product Growth.

Each Distributor references a system Item by it s own Distributor Item and Distributor Item Description. For example a Whopper can be referred to as BEEF WHOPPER 4.0 OZ while another company calls it WHOPPER and a third company calls it WHOPPER CS 144EA . Cross referencing or matching system items with each of the Distributors is what allows a user to view inventory or sales for the Whopper without knowing the Distributor s naming conventions.

In some cases a Distributor may have more than one Item SKU for a particular system Item. A slight packaging change may cause the Distributor to create 2 SKU s for what could otherwise be considered one system Item.

For example a DC that services 100 Restaurants changes SKU s mid month and reports selling 1000 cases of the first SKU to half of its Restaurants and 1000 cases of the second SKU to the other half. Average Units sold per Restaurant Month in this case would be the number of Items sold 2000 divided by the Restaurant Count 100 or 20.

A Distributor may not always change an SKU. They may consider CUP PROMO a catch all even though there is a separate Item for each CUP promotion.

The Formula Pricing System of the present invention allows quick and easy calculation of the weekly meat block cost for all suppliers.

A new Formula Pricing can be created in either of two ways. The first one is to build a Formula Pricing from scratch. The second method uses the New Using Previous feature which will create an entire copy of a previous Formula Pricing and allow a user to make the necessary modifications.

To use the New Using Previous feature select New Using Previous from the Formula Pricing submenu to copy an existing Formula Pricing into a new one. A complete copy of a previous Formula Pricing can be made by selecting this option.

The first tab visible on the Formula Pricing window when it is opened is the General Info tab which shows pricing description item date ranges and Adjustment amount. This tab is where general information for this Formula Pricing is entered. The fields of the General Info page include 

The Date column includes the period dates excluding weekends. These dates can be modified. If the date exist in a previous pricing the message window shown in will pop up. If the user answers yes the prices for that date will be inserted into the current Formula Pricing.

If there are more than one pricing with the same date the message window shown in will appear. If the user answers yes a selection window depicted in will appear to allow selection of the pricing data that the user wants to copy over the current pricing.

Some of the raw materials price is calculated based on other materials. The following is an illustrative list of these materials with their formulas.

The following Table describes illustrative formulas. The freight amount if any is added to each raw material average market quote.

After the Formula Pricing is completed the user can print the Raw Material Letter which describes the prices of the raw materials for the different suppliers of the current Formula Pricing. To retrieve the Raw Material Letter the RM Letter icon is selected. See .
