This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application 60 552 792 filed on Nov. 8 2004 the entire file wrapper contents of which provisional application are herein incorporated by reference as though fully set forth at length.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to apparatus for transporting ammunition cartridges through a gun firing system and in particular to a transport apparatus that uses loops and couplings.

To convey ammunition cartridges for example 40 mm cartridges through a weapon a transport means is necessary to position and guide the cartridges through the gun firing system. The transport means may include couplings and loops. The cartridges are positioned in the loops and the couplings link the loops together. A plurality of cartridges and loops are connected together by the couplings to form an ammunition belt. The couplings and loops are physically shocked pulled and distorted throughout the firing cycle and therefore require a certain strength to function properly.

Known ammunition belts are packaged for the specific end user in belt sizes with typically 32 or 94 rounds. However there is no means for disconnecting or connecting or assembling or disassembling any ammunition cartridges from the original belt. An easy to use connect disconnect feature is needed. For example splicing partial belts into full belts switching from one belt type to another i.e. 32 round belt to 94 round belt and assembling various size belts at the factory would all be easier with a connect disconnect feature.

The loading of a new belt onto a weapon is time consuming and exposes the user to hostile fire during the belt re loading stage. Perhaps the most important advantage of a connect disconnect feature is the ability to connect additional belts to an already loaded belt of ammunition. It would be much easier and safer for a soldier under fire to simply connect additional belts to an already loaded belt rather than having to reload each belt onto the weapon. Furthermore in the past partially used belts with only a few rounds have been discarded. With a connect disconnect feature the partially used belts can be connected together and used thereby eliminating wasted ammunition and the problem of disposing of live discarded ammunition.

It is an object of the invention to provide an ammunition belt that is easily connected to and disconnected from other ammunition belts.

Another object of the invention is to provide a loop and coupling type transport apparatus for ammunition cartridges wherein adjacent ammunition cartridges can be easily and quickly connected or disconnected.

A further object of the invention is to provide an ammunition cartridge transport apparatus that saves ammunition by allowing partially used belts of ammunition to be connected together.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a coupling for a loop and coupling type ammunition cartridge transport apparatus wherein the coupling is rotatable from a locked position to an unlocked position.

Still another object of the invention is to provide a coupling that can be used with existing cartridge loops.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a cartridge loop the cartridge loop having a coupling interface with an opening defined in part by a pair of substantially parallel lines separated by a distance and a coupling comprising first and second ends and a link that connects the first and second ends the first end connecting with the coupling interface of the cartridge loop wherein a portion of the link adjacent the first end has a first thickness that is greater than the distance between the substantially parallel lines and a second thickness that is less than the distance between the substantially parallel lines.

Preferably a cross section of the portion of the link comprises a second pair of substantially parallel lines separated by the second thickness. The apparatus may further comprise a second cartridge loop having a coupling support that connects with the second end of the coupling.

In a preferred embodiment the first end of the coupling comprises a locking head with four sides and the coupling interface comprises a front wall and two side walls disposed on opposite sides of the front wall the opening of the coupling interface being defined in the front wall and the locking head being disposed between the side walls. Advantageously a diagonal of the locking head has a length such that the diagonal forms an interference fit with the side walls.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A portion of the link adjacent the first end has a thickness that is greater than the distance between the substantially parallel lines and a thickness that is less than the distance between the substantially parallel lines . The thickness and the thickness are measured orthogonal to each other. A cross section of the portion of the link comprises a pair of substantially parallel lines separated by the thickness . The cross section of the portion of the link may also include a pair of arcs connected to ends of the pair of substantially parallel lines respectively. The thickness corresponds to the longest distance between the pair of arcs .

The first end of the coupling also comprises a locking head with four sides as best seen in . The locking head is disposed between the side walls of the coupling interface . The diagonal of the locking head has a length such that when rotated the locking head forms an interference fit with the side walls that are a distance apart. The interference fit allows a person by applying a twisting torque to adjacent cartridges to rotate the locking head within the side walls but prevents the locking head from rotating freely within the side walls .

During rotation of the locking head a snapping force is generated in the loop . As the locking head is rotated within the side walls the locking head interferes with the side walls causing the side walls to deform slightly outwards. As the ninety degree rotation continues and the diagonal of the locking head no longer contacts the side walls the side walls snap back and help lock the locking head in position. This locking action maintains the characteristics of the known ammunition belt when exposed to the weapon firing forces.

Three features of the invention are very important for proper functioning. First the thickness of the portion of the link adjacent the first end is greater than the distance between the substantially parallel lines of the opening of the coupling interface . When the coupling is in a locked position the thickness prevents the coupling from sliding out of the opening .

Second the thickness of the portion of the link adjacent the first end is less than the distance between the substantially parallel lines of the opening . When the coupling is in an unlocked position the thickness allows the coupling to slide out of the open end of the opening between the diverging lines .

Third the length of the diagonal of the locking head is such that the diagonal forms an interference fit between the side walls spaced apart by a distance of the coupling interface . Thus the coupling may be rotated ninety degrees from a locked position to an unlocked position and vice versa.

The embodiment of the novel coupling that is shown is the preferred embodiment because that embodiment can be produced with a minimum of modification to the existing tooling. However the invention is not limited to the embodiment shown. As long as the coupling has the three important features noted above it should be able to function satisfactorily. Thus various features of the coupling and the loop such as the opening in the coupling interface and the first end second end and link of the coupling may in other embodiments of the invention comprise geometrical shapes that differ from the specific shapes shown.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
