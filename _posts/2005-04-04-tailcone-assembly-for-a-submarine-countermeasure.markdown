The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates to a submarine countermeasure apparatus and is directed more particularly to an improved tailcone assembly therefor.

In there is shown a typical submarine countermeasure apparatus . The apparatus includes a launch tube which in operation is disposed outboard of the submarine pressure hull not shown . A countermeasure is housed in the launch tube and includes an array assembly and a tailcone assembly . The array assembly is protected by a surrounding sabot . Disposed in the launch tube is a ram plate and a gas generator . The launch tube is closed by a forward tube cover and an after tube cover .

In operation the gas generator is activated by an electrical pulse from the submarine fire control system and generates sufficient gas pressure to move the ram plate forwardly. The ram plate pushes the countermeasure forwardly breaking away the forward tube cover and launching the countermeasure from the launch tube . In short order the sabot disengages from around the array assembly and the array assembly is activated to produce acoustic energy.

It has been found that upon launch of the current countermeasure a joint between the tailcone assembly and a body portion of the countermeasure apparatus is sometimes subjected to substantial bending moments. The current tailcone assembly in particular is subjected to such bending moments during launch out of the launch tube . The bending moments sometimes result in vehicle joint damage and launch or deployment failure. The ram plate pushes against the tailcone assembly with a force in thousands of pounds. Bending moments on the countermeasure apparatus caused by water impacting the side of the countermeasure as it exits the launch tube perpendicular to the water vectors while the submarine is underway can be in thousands of foot pounds.

Accordingly there is a need for an improved tailcone assembly which can withstand and or minimize severe bending moments.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide an improved tailcone assembly for a submarine countermeasure apparatus the tailcone assembly being structured for successful launch and deployment under conditions inflicting potentially high bending moments upon the countermeasure apparatus.

With the above and other objects in view a feature of the invention is the provision of a tailcone assembly for a submarine countermeasure. The assembly comprises a generally hemispherically shaped shell having a planar aft end and an annular open forward end at least three fins fixed to the shell equidistantly around the shell externally thereof each of the fins having a planar outboard surface extending aft and inboard of the shell. A connector structure is disposed on the forward end of the shell for connecting to an aft end of the countermeasure. A first aperture is disposed in a side of the shell and a cable extends from inside the shell therethrough. A second aperture extends through one of the fins and the cable extends through the second aperture. An opening is disposed centrally of the shell aft end extends therethrough and is adapted to retain a shaft assembly therein.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that an illustrative tailcone assembly includes a tailcone which may be cast or molded in one piece. The tailcone includes a generally hemispherically shaped shell having a planar aft end and an annular open forward end .

A plurality of fins preferably four are shown extending from the shell . The fins preferably are integral with the shell and extend from the external surface of the shell. As shown in the fins extend aft downwardly as shown in and incline inboard as will be further discussed hereinbelow.

The shell is provided with connector structure preferably in the form of external threads for connecting to an aft end of the countermeasure body portion . Alternate connections could include radial flat head fasteners radial pins and internal or external joint rings and clamps.

It has been established that the maximum pitch angle of a tailcone free to move widthwise in a conventional launch tube is less than seven degrees. That is if a bending moment forces the centerline of the tailcone out of sync with the centerline of the launch tube the angle between the centerlines has been found to be less than 7 .

In accordance with the present invention outer surfaces of the fins are angled inwardly 7 such that the fins under maximum bending conditions do not jam against the inside wall of the launch tube .

Referring to it will be seen that the shell is hemispherically shaped along a radius R from a center point C on the line of the joint . An angle A of about 7 is defined by the joint and a radius R. The fin outer surfaces extend normal to the radius line R. Thus the fins extend inwardly so as not to jam against the launch tube inside surface .

The shell is provided with a first aperture in the side thereof. The tailcone is provided with an umbilical cable which is cut upon ejection of the counter measure from the launch tube . In the prior art a clamp shear not shown is disposed on the tailcone. The tailcone provided herein is shorter and more compact than the prior art tailcone and space in the present tailcone assembly for a clamp shear is problematic. Instead the umbilical cable is passed through the first aperture and thence through a second aperture extending through one of the fins most proximate to the first aperture .

In preparing the tailcone for attachment to the countermeasure body portion the cable is looped as at and optionally knotted as at . The cable is passed through the second aperture and looped as at on the other side of the fin

Preferably cable straps are held adjacent the fin by a bolt extending through the fin and disposed proximate the second aperture . The cable straps serve to stabilize the cable .

As seen in the aperture slants forwardly upwardly as seen in from a first side of the fin to a second side of the fin . Edges of the second aperture on the first side of the fin are rounded. A forward edge of the second aperture on the second side of the fin is also rounded. However an after edge of the second aperture on the second side of the fin is formed as a cutting edge. Accordingly tension applied to the cable in an aft direction as when the ram plate to which the cable is fixed stops and the tailcone continues moving forwardly in the launch direction causes the cable to move through the second cable strap and forcefully engage the cutting edge to sever the cable . The cable portion aft of the cable cut slides through the cable strap therearound and is left behind as the tailcone and remainder of the countermeasure exit the launch tube .

As shown in the tailcone aft end is provided with an opening in which is disposed a shaft housing a motor and gearbox a propeller shaft connected to the gearbox as by a coupling and a seal bearing . The entire motor gearbox shaft housing unit can be inserted from the outside of the tailcone by slipping the unit into the opening and securing it by a spiral ring . An o ring is provided to seal the shaft housing in opening .

The new tailcone provides the benefit of not jamming in the launch tube and eliminates bending loads from the tailcone joint during an attempted launch under conditions of high bending moment. In addition the tailcone described herein can be molded as an integral unitary shell and fin unit of metal or plastics or composite materials which reduces substantially the cost of the unit. Further the new tailcone described herein permits for a shorter length than the prior art tailcone by about four inches thereby permitting four additional inches of length in the countermeasure for additional equipment. Still further the umbilical cable cutting feature replaces a prior art clamp shear which was an expensive discrete cutting implement.

There is thus presented an improved tailcone in which the aforementioned bending moment problem has been essentially eliminated and which provides additional salutary improvements.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims. For example it has been found that three fins as well as four are suitable for implementation of the above noted features and still provide the necessary structural integrity.
