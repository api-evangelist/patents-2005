title: Generic, multi-instance method and GUI detection system for tracking and monitoring computer applications
abstract: Presented is a system and method for monitoring events derived from a computer target application presentation layer including the steps of providing, independent of recompiling the target application's source code, a script running at a level within the target application. The script scans run-time instantiations of objects of the target application, and allocates structures in real-time to the object instantiations. These allocated structures are adapted to create a reflection of the target application structure, which is used along with detected object instantiations that match a predetermined object structure to capture a portion of an environmental spectrum of the detected object. Further, the system can process state machine events occurring on at least one of a server machine and a client/localized machine, correlate the state machine events with the environmental spectrum, and deduce a user experience based on the correlated state machine events.
