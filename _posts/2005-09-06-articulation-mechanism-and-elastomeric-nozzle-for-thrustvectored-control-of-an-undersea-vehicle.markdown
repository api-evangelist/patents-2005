title: Articulation mechanism and elastomeric nozzle for thrust-vectored control of an undersea vehicle
abstract: The mechanism of the present invention maneuvers a vehicle by deflecting the flow from a propulsor of the vehicle. The mechanism has an elastomeric nozzle that encases the flow and is deflected via an articulation device mountable inside the vehicle. The nozzle is shaped and supported by spiral-wound composite to maintain a circular cross-section through a range of motion. An end of the nozzle is attached to the shroud of the propulsor and another end is supported by a ring with support struts radiating from a hub. The hub is supported by a shaft attached to a gimbal. The gimbal is constrained in movement by an outer race and an anti-rotation stud in a radial slot in a ball of the gimbal. A linkage as part of an articulation device controls rotation of the gimbal to direct movement of the shaft and enclosed nozzle thereby deflecting flow of the propulsor.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 612 395 filed Sep. 20 2004 and which is entitled ARTICULATION MECHANISM AND ELASTOMERIC NOZZLE FOR THRUST VECTORED CONTROL OF AN UNDERSEA VEHICLE by Daniel Paul Thivierge Allen Luther Treaster Michael John Beam Todd Kevin Fetterolf Alberico Menozzi Daniel R. Metrey and Richard E. Dooley.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention provides a mechanism to control the motion of underwater vehicles including submarines torpedoes and unmanned underwater vehicles UUV s . The proposed mechanism provides thrust vectoring by redirecting the propulsor exhaust flow via a two plane articulation mechanism deflecting an elastomeric exhaust nozzle.

In the art airfoil shaped control surfaces are used to direct the movement of underwater vehicles by deflection of water flow across the contours of the control surfaces. These control surfaces are effective as long as the vehicle s velocity is two nautical miles per hour knots or faster. However it is often desirable to maneuver at speeds less than two knots. Also at times it is desired to possess enhanced maneuvering capabilities at speeds faster than two knots.

Another problem is that at high deflection angles control surfaces can be a significant source of cavitation and noise. This cavitation and noise can occur at both high and low speeds.

As such a need exists to provide a control mechanism that provides enhanced maneuvering capability while minimizing the effects of cavitation and noise normally caused when high deflection angles are used during propulsion.

Accordingly it is a general purpose and object of the present invention to provide a mechanism that delivers enhanced maneuvering capabilities at high and low speeds.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a mechanism that minimizes the effects of cavitation and noise during maneuvering.

It is a still further object of the present invention to provide a mechanism that delivers enhanced maneuvering capabilities and is suitable for use on vehicles such as submarines torpedoes and unmanned underwater vehicles UUV s .

In order to attain the objects described above the proposed mechanism converts linear motion of actuators to rotational motion thru bulkheads and seals. Rotational motion is then converted back to linear motion and drives tie rods attached to a gimbal mechanism in turn deflecting an elastomeric nozzle.

Generally the device of the present invention provides thrust vectoring by redirecting a propulsor exhaust flow via an articulation mechanism deflecting the elastomeric exhaust nozzle. The nozzle encases the propulsor exhaust flow and directs the flow to the desired vector. The nozzle itself is preferably fabricated from an elastomer such as Navy red rubber and internally shaped and supported by a spiral wound fiberglass based composite. This fabrication allows the nozzle to maintain the needed cross sectional area during vectoring.

An end of the nozzle is attached to the duct or shroud of the propulsor of the vehicle. The opposite end of the nozzle is supported by a ring with radial airfoil shaped support struts radiating from a central hub. The support struts de swirl the through flow of water to eliminate rotational moments on the vehicle.

More specifically the drive hardware of the articulation mechanism rotates on a gimbal bearing and is driven by two linear electric actuators operating through a linkage system. The spherical gimbal bearing is supported through an outer race by a stationary aft end of the vehicle. The gimbal bearing is constrained by the outer race and by a stationary anti rotation stud with a polymer anti wear sleeve via a radial slot in a ball of the gimbal bearing. The constraint of the outer race the anti rotation stud and the radial slot permit only two rotational degrees of freedom in the gimbal bearing.

The motion is generated in the gimbal bearing via two tie rods that are attached to the ball of the gimbal bearing by two smaller gimbal or tie rod bearings. The tie rod bearings are mounted in a vertical plane of the gimbal bearing. The angle between the lines connecting each of the tie rod bearings and the centerline of the gimbal bearing is 90 degrees.

The opposite end of the tie rods is mechanically connected to tie rod bearings. The bearings of the tie rods are attached to rotational linkages of the linkage system. The rotational linkages are respectively keyed to control shafts and clevis that are respectively actuated rotated by the electric linear actuators. By coordinating the motion between the two actuators the central hub struts and ring can be pivoted. The pivoting of the central hub struts and ring in turn pivots the nozzle within a volume contour of a cone with the included angle from the centerline of the cone to the surface of the cone being 25 degrees. Within this volume contour the proposed mechanism provides thrust vectoring by redirecting the propulsor exhaust flow and thereby delivering enhanced maneuvering capabilities at high and low speeds.

Most underwater vehicles are propelled by a propulsor at the aft end of the vehicle. The propulsor may have one or two rotating propellers and may also operate in a ducted configuration. These propulsors create an axial flow of water along the vehicles centerline with a speed greater than the forward speed of the vehicle.

As shown in the mechanism of the present invention under consideration enables a simple means of maneuvering a vehicle by deflecting the flow of water in the direction A at an angle opposite the desired motion B of the vehicle. Enhanced maneuvering capabilities are possible by briefly changing the rotational speed of a propeller of the vehicle during the maneuvering of the vehicle.

The mechanism has a near cylindrical or frusto conical elastomeric boot or nozzle that encases the propulsor exhaust flow identical in direction to water flow direction A . The nozzle is shaped to match the predicted geometry of an undeflected propulsor exhaust jet.

The elastomeric nozzle is deflected via an articulation device mounted inside the vehicle . As will be further described below the articulation device features tail cone drive ring hardware which directly deflects the nozzle . As partially shown in the hardware of drive ring rotates on a gimbal bearing and is driven by two linear electric actuators operating through a linkage system .

The elastomeric nozzle shown in varying directions in is shaped to match the exhaust flow field of the duct or shroud of propulsor and shapes in identical direction to water flow direction A . The nozzle is preferably fabricated from an elastomer such as Navy red rubber and internally shaped and supported by spiral wound fiberglass based composite. The nozzle is designed to maintain its circular cross section through its full range of motion by pre tensioning to more than 50 of its original state at assembly.

An end with the larger diameter of the nozzle is rigidly attached to the duct or shroud of the propulsor which encompasses the propeller of the propulsor . The nozzle is attached and compressed using segmented clamp rings or other suitable clamping devices known to those skilled in the art.

An opposite end of the nozzle with a smaller diameter is supported by the ring with radial airfoil shaped support struts radiating from a central hub See . The support struts de swirl the through flow of water to eliminate rotational moments on the vehicle . The assembly of the hub the struts and the ring is supported by a shaft which is attached to the spherical gimbal bearing .

The spherical gimbal bearing is supported through an outer race by a stationary aft end of the vehicle See . The gimbal bearing is constrained by the outer race and by a stationary anti rotation stud with a polymer anti wear sleeve via a radial slot in a ball of the gimbal bearing See . The constraint of the outer race the anti rotation stud and the radial slot permit only two rotational degrees of freedom in the gimbal bearing .

The one rotational degree of freedom eliminated by the anti rotation stud is the axis of rotation about the vehicle centerline . Thus the shaft support struts and aft end of the nozzle are permitted to pivot about the center of the gimbal bearing in any plane that contains the centerline of the vehicle See example plane in and alternate example plane in . The mechanism was designed to permit plus or minus 25 degrees of movement in any of these planes See the representative position of the ring of .

The pivoting motion is generated in the gimbal bearing via two tie rods that are attached to the ball of the gimbal bearing by two smaller gimbal or tie rod bearings See . The tie rod bearings are mounted in a vertical plane as a face of the gimbal bearing . The angle between the lines connecting each of the tie rod bearings and the centerline of the gimbal bearing is 90 degrees.

The opposite end of the tie rods is mechanically connected to tie rod bearings . The bearings of the tie rods are attached to rotational linkages of the linkage system . The rotational linkages are respectively keyed to rotary control shafts and clevis that are respectively actuated rotated by the electric linear actuators . By coordinating the motion between each of the actuators the central hub struts and ring can be pivoted. The pivoting of the central hub struts and ring in turn pivots the nozzle within a volume contour of a cone with the included angle from the centerline of the cone to the surface of the cone being 25 degrees See example volume in . Within this volume contour the proposed mechanism provides thrust vectoring by redirecting the propulsor exhaust flow and thereby delivering enhanced maneuvering capabilities at high and low speeds.

An important detail to note is that one half of the mechanism is exposed to undersea conditions and another half of the mechanism is isolated from undersea conditions. The nozzle ring shaft gimbal bearing tie rods linkages and one half of the rotary control shafts are exposed to undersea conditions. The rotary control shafts with the use of O rings typical of O rings known to those skilled in the art pass through a sealed bulkhead to the clevis and linear actuators which are isolated from undersea conditions.

A propulsor with the mechanism installed eliminates the need for the vehicle velocity dependant control surfaces found on conventional propulsor designs. As a result slow speed maneuvering is enhanced considerably. At elevated vehicles velocities flow across the outside of the deflected nozzle further enhances the mechanism control effectiveness.

Also the elimination of convention control surfaces and associate linkage mechanisms enables the use of a rim driven motor to drive the propeller thus saving significant volume in the vehicle that could be used for added energy storage or payloads. A rim driven motor is used in the propulsor illustrated in .

Alternative embodiments include hydraulic actuators or other actuators known to those skilled in the art replacing the electric actuators . Furthermore smart materials or electroelastomers could be used instead of the elastomeric nozzle and articulation mechanism.

While the invention has been described in connection with what is considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment it should be understood that this invention is not to be limited to the disclosed embodiment but on the contrary is intended to cover various modifications and equivalent arrangements included within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
