title: Method of making a one-piece loop for ammunition cartridge
abstract: A one-piece metal cartridge loop has no welds and no overlapping parts. The cartridge loop includes a plurality of locking tabs for positioning a cartridge therein. One end of the cartridge loop includes a coupling interface and another end of the cartridge loop includes a coupling support. A method of making the non-welded cartridge loop is disclosed.

This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application 60 522 468 filed on Oct. 4 2004 which application is hereby incorporated by reference.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to apparatus for transporting ammunition cartridges through a gun firing system and in particular to a transport apparatus that uses loops and couplings.

To convey ammunition cartridges for example 40 mm cartridges through a weapon a transport means is necessary to position and guide the cartridges through the gun firing system. The transport means may include couplings and loops. The cartridges are positioned in the loops and the couplings link the loops together. shows cartridges disposed in loops that are connected by a coupling . shows two loops without the cartridges . The couplings and loops are physically shocked pulled and distorted throughout the firing cycle and therefore require a certain strength to function properly.

The weld joints are one source of operational and production problems. During surface preparation the assembled part is bathed in cleansers such as acid. The acid seeps between the overlapped side members and cannot be fully rinsed away. During long term storage the acid etches away at members and projection welds and may ultimately cause failure of the loop .

The weld joints are also prone to failure because of variables in the projection welding process such as amperage projection weld contact variations and surface preparation variation. The welded loops must be surface finished i.e. phosphated after welding. The weld joint is difficult to phosphate. The strength of the weld varies from vendor to vendor and set up to set up. Long term storage of the welded loops is affected by the lack of consistent coating at the weld joint allowing rust to develop and degrade the weld strength. Manufacturers continually increase the price for the loops because of welding and finishing difficulties.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a cartridge loop that is lighter in weight than the known loop.

Still another object of the invention is to provide a method of making a one piece cartridge loop that has no welds.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a one piece metal cartridge loop having no welds and no overlapping parts. The cartridge loop may include a plurality of locking tabs for positioning a cartridge therein. One end of the cartridge loop may include a coupling interface and another end of the cartridge loop may include a coupling support. Preferably the locking tabs are operable to position a 40 mm cartridge.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of making a one piece cartridge loop having no welds comprising providing generally tubular raw material forming the external profile of the loop from the tubular raw material and forming mechanical details of the loop. The mechanical details may include a plurality of locking tabs a coupling support and a coupling interface. The step of forming mechanical details may include notching machining and or kinking.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The present invention is a one piece cartridge loop that eliminates the known overlapping weld joint. The elimination of the overlapping weld joint provides a stronger cartridge loop by replacing the projection weld joint with solid steel. The finishing process is easier because there is no longer an overlapping weld joint to clean and finish. Because the finishing process is more uniform and consistent the loops have a longer shelf life. Eliminating the weld joint reduces the fabrication costs because less raw material is used and no weld testing is required. A weight reduction of about 15 is realized by omitting the overlapping weld joint.

A method for making the known loops shown in begins by stamping flat sheet stock. The flat stamped portions are notched pierced and formed. The portions are bent to form the two parts shown in . The ends of the side members are located and fixed and then projection welded. A series of cleaning and surface preparation operations follows. The projection welds are tested. The result is the loop with its double thick overlapped joint that is welded together.

In accordance with the invention a method of making a one piece cartridge loop includes providing generally tubular raw material made of for example steel. The tubular raw material may be formed by for example extrusion. The external profile of the loop is formed from the tubular raw material. The mechanical details of the loop are formed by for example notching kinking and or machining. The mechanical details include the coupling interface the coupling support and the locking tabs . Preferably all the locking tabs are formed simultaneously. Simultaneous formation of the locking tabs on a single loop minimizes variations in the locking tabs such as may occur in the prior method wherein the locking tabs are formed on the separate pieces . Notably no welding is used to form the side members . The loop undergoes conventional surface preparation and finishing processes.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
