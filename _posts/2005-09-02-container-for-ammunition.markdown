The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates to the field of military ordnance. In particular it relates to large caliber ammunition fired from weapons in the arsenal of the United States Army and more specifically to ammunition containers that protect the rounds fired from these weapons. While specifically developed for mortar ammunition the invention is readily adapted to tank ammunition grenades and other ammunition families.

Ordnance used on the modern battlefield and in training exercises by the United States Army must be protected from the effects of vibration shock and exposure to the elements. Exemplary cases are relatively lightweight mobile weapons such as the Army s 60 mm 81 mm and 120 mm mortars. The inherent portability flexibility and ubiquity of these weapons dictate that they and the ammunition they fire can and will be exposed to a very wide range of non ideal conditions.

These weapons and their ammunition are required to perform in conditions that include extreme heat and cold as well as wet and dusty environs. Ammunition for these mortars is expected to survive high g loadings such as those that might be experienced when being transported by tracked or wheeled vehicles carried by soldiers or even delivered by fixed or rotary wing aircraft or by parachute.

Recent emphasis on rapid deployment and the requirement for heretofore unimaginable mobility and unprecedented firepower as exemplified by the US Army s new Lightweight Brigade Combat Team BCT gives all new importance to minimizing the weight and volume associated with packing materials while maintaining the protection required by these highly explosive rounds. In addition cost and environmental concerns can no longer be ignored and therefore must be addressed in an effective manner. These requirements place added restrictions on construction materials and techniques and require that the containers be re usable and or recyclable.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 772 877 issued on Aug. 10 2004 and is hereby expressly incorporated by reference. The 877 patent discloses a MONOPAQ container. While the MONOPAQ container of the 877 patent has functioned better than its predecessor some of its features may be improved. First because the MONOPAQ container and ammunition cartridge stored therein are handled by one person weight is an important factor. Any weight reduction is helpful. Second an ammunition container must be sealed in a manner to provide full environmental protection to ammunition packaged for 20 years of indoor storage and 2 years of outdoor storage. Such a seal must withstand at least a 3 psi differential. The known MONOPAQ container has dimensional restraints that make it difficult to obtain a satisfactory seal. Third the carrying handle of the MONOPAQ container needs to be lightweight sturdy and easily manufactured and assembled.

It is an object of the invention to provide a MONOPAQ container with reduced weight in particular with a reduced weight cartridge support.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Details of the prior MONOPAQ container are found in U.S. Pat. No. 6 772 877. The present invention includes several changes to the prior MONOPAQ container. The known container includes a cartridge support disposed inside the container for supporting the forward or fuze end of a cartridge. In the present invention a novel cartridge support is lighter and stronger. The known container uses a conventional gasket to seal the cap of the container to the body. The present invention uses a novel configuration of the mating surfaces of the cap and body and two gaskets one in the cap and one in the body to seal the cap to the body. Further the present invention includes an innovative lightweight collapsible carrying handle.

The external surface of the support includes a flange at a rear end of the support a third conical surface that increases in diameter from the base of flange toward the forward end of the support and a reduced diameter cylindrical surface that extends from the end of third conical surface to the end of the support . The step or notch created between third conical surface and reduced diameter cylindrical surface mates with a corresponding notch in the MONOPAQ container body to securely locate the support in the container body . The tapered nature of the third conical surface provides for the best possible compression and rebound of the container .

As shown in flange includes a plurality of slots formed on its rear surface. The slots help reduce the amount of material used and the weight of support and consequently the weight of container . Preferably the slots are circumferentially evenly spaced. In one preferred embodiment the number of slots is eight.

A plurality of longitudinal ribs are formed on the conical surface . Each rib extends from the forward face of the flange to the end of conical surface . As seen in the radial width of each rib is largest where the rib abuts flange and decreases as the diameter of conical surface increases until the rib completely blends with conical surface where notch is formed. As best seen in the outermost radial extent of each rib is constant along the longitudinal length of the support and does not exceed the outside diameter of the flange . Preferably the ribs are circumferentially evenly spaced. In one preferred embodiment the number of ribs is eight.

The use of ribs decreases the overall weight of support and spreads the dynamic load distribution over a larger amount of material. The longitudinal ribs significantly increase the strength of the support in the longitudinal direction. This increased strength helps avoid cracking which is a common failure for thermoplastics of the support during rough handling impacts of the container . Flange also increases the strength of the support in both the radial and longitudinal directions. The flange substantially increases the hoop strength of the support in the radial direction and prevents the interior opening of support from being forcibly enlarged upon a nose down impact. An enlarged support opening would allow the cartridge to penetrate through the support and hit the bottom of the container . As a result the cartridge would likely receive unrecoverable damages. The ribs and flange are important in preventing such an enlargement of the interior opening of support .

A preferred composition of the support is high density polyethylene HDPE . The support satisfies packaging performance requirements from ambient to temperature extremes 60 F. and 160 F. . The MONOPAQ cartridge support provides fuze protection and satisfies dynamic loading and drop testing requirements. The cartridge support can be adapted to other U.S. or foreign ammunition packaging which require similar internal cartridge fuze support. The cartridge support is placed in the forward end of the MONOPAQ container before the cartridge is inserted. If necessary the support can be bonded to the bottom of the container to eliminate the presence of loose or moving parts. The cylindrical support allows the nose end of the cartridge to rest on its first conical surface while completely surrounding and protecting the fuze.

Another aspect of the present invention is a new sealing system for the MONOPAQ container. An ammunition container must have the ability to provide full environmental protection to ammunition packaged for 20 years of indoor storage and 2 years of outdoor storage. A container that holds a leak proof seal at both hot 160 F. and cold 65 F. temperature extremes helps meet this requirement. Such a seal must remain intact and retain a 3 psi seal following compression vibrations and drops that frequently occur during storage and transportation.

The inventive sealing system includes novel mating surfaces on the body and cap of the MONOPAQ container and novel gaskets for the body and cap mating surfaces. The sealing system uses the interface of two gaskets to provide a leak proof seal that meets the performance requirements for ammunition containers. The inventive gaskets are made of for example neoprene rubber.

Removal of the cap from the body is easier with the taper as compared to a non tapered body. A small gap between the taper and the cap interior wall allows the U shaped gasket room to expand when compressed which is essential for a tight seal. The U shaped gasket is neoprene molded to match the exact dimensions regarding the diameter of the body opening and the tapered body end . High strength adhesive is applied to the taper and then the gasket is installed.

The contact of the two gaskets allows for a larger seal area than if only one gasket was used. This is because both gaskets are in compression which forms a large seal area compared to the tight dimensional confines of the cap body interface area. As well as sealing in compression the body gasket also seals with shear force on the inside of the cap without compromising the forces needed to apply or remove the cap. When the container is dropped or vibrated severely the cap moves in and out slightly with respect to the body . The use of the two gaskets allows for this slight displacement as a means of shock absorption while retaining seal ability. The cap gasket also acts as a cushion that provides substantial protection to avoid cuts on the body gasket .

1. Cap gasket is added to the cap Cap is designed to accept the rectangular cross section of the neoprene gasket . The cap channel or notch is coated with adhesive and the gasket is then inserted. The cap notch keeps the gasket highly constrained even if the adhesive fails.

2. Gasket is added to the body taper The body taper allows proper fit into the U shaped gasket . As with the cap gasket an adhesive is applied to keep the gasket secure.

3. Assembly of cap and body A seal is made in compression between the cap gasket and the body gasket . The body gasket also forms a shear seal with the polyester composite material that forms the inside of the cap . Due to the dimensional constraints on the container the use of two gaskets allows great compression accomplished at a level that is acceptable for latch open close forces.

Another aspect of the invention is a carrying handle for the MONOPAQ container . The soldier requires a sturdy handle to rapidly transport the containers containing ammunition in an adverse battlefield environment. This requirement is more critical when operating in a remote area where motorized transportation is not viable as was learned in the Southwest Asia theater. The innovative lightweight collapsible carrying handle of the present invention satisfies this requirement and solves this problem.

The inventive handle for the MONOPAQ container is a simple and cost effective solution to handle mounting. There is no need for expensive adhesives which usually do not maintain the required strength at both high and low temperature extremes reinforced metal brackets steel handle levers mechanical fasteners or any closure components that may require the use of secondary manufacturing operations. As shown in the handle comprises two main components bosses and a strap . The handle bosses are preferably compression molded as a single piece with the container body . The handle strap is preferably made of woven polypropylene. The strap is easily installed on the bosses through a small open slot on top of the boss. The elimination of adhesive mechanical fasteners closure components and special tools drastically decreases the possibility of human error during the assembly operation. The design also allows for a simple inexpensive replacement of the handle strap if rework is ever required for the container in the field environment.

The handle exceeds the 175 pound minimum breaking strength for pull test at 160 F. and 65 F. temperatures. The carrying handle breaking strength averages over 350 pounds based on lab test results. The handle remains fully collapsible so as not to impede on the envelope requirements of the container . The handle strap can be easily removed and replaced if for example the container is subjected to NBC Nuclear Biological Chemical contamination. The handle uses no metal parts which is beneficial for passing the fast and slow cook off FCO and SCO testing requirements as there are no hazardous metal fragments generated during the FCO and SCO scenarios. As a result better Insensitive Munitions IM response is obtained. The handle strap also successfully passed the sequential rough handling drop vibration testing of the container .

As shown in the strap assembly process is as simple as tightly pinching the handle strap in half as shown by in and inserting the strap into the vertical channel . The strap naturally opens up into the horizontal channel . Strap remains completely collapsible in the horizontal channels . Pull testing has shown that the composite handle bosses will fail at maximum weight before the strap can be pulled out of the mounting boss .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
