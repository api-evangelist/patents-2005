The invention described herein may be made used licensed by or for the United States Government for government purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

This invention relates generally to the detection and destruction and or disablement of explosives and in particular to apparatus and accompanying methods for the detection and destruction and or disablement of Improvised Explosive Devices IEDs .

Enemies of the United States have resorted to the use of improved explosive devices often made from widely available components to attack disrupt U.S. personnel and assets. The devices being used for remote control activate and detonate such destructive actions in general use electronics that require power. A promising strategy is to detect deactivate disrupt and eliminate the power source from providing energy to the IED sensing and actuation electronics and related power supply components.

We have developed in accordance with the teachings of the present invention apparatus and accompanying methods for the detection and subsequent destruction or disablement of Improvised Explosive Devices IEDs while maintaining a satisfactory level of human safety.

Operationally our inventive method and apparatus detects the IED using one or more methods including detecting internal battery components detecting magnetic signature s of the IED detecting a characteristic energy spectrum of the IED and or detecting characteristic chemical signatures of the device s . Once detected the device may be further characterized and then subsequently deactivated and or destroyed by a shaped pulse charge directed at the device or its power source battery from a safe distance.

In a preferred embodiment the shaped pulse charge is generated and subsequently directed through the effect of a number of open ended waveguides the energies from which combine at the IED target thereby achieving maximal effect.

Advantageously since our shaped pulse charge is most energetic at the location of the IED target its collateral effect on nearby structures is minimized.

According to our inventive teachings the detection of an IED is performed at a safe radial distance from the device. Subsequent disablement and or destruction of the device is performed from a safe radial distance which may be even further than the detection distance.

As can be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art batteries or other portable power sources are used to provide power for communication triggering and other IED functions requiring electrical energy. In principle nearly all types of batteries both primary non rechargeable and secondary rechargeable can be used for such IEDs.

Due to their ready availability most of the crude IEDs likely to be encountered in the field employ batteries that are commercially available such as cell phone batteries Ni Cd Ni MH and Li ion Leclanch and other manganese containing batteries and dry cells. All of these batteries have a characteristic magnetic signature which depends on the inherent magnetic properties of the materials used in battery construction.

For example batteries with nickel or its compounds are ferromagnetic as are materials used in most Li ion batteries and thus are readily detected over short distances. Other materials are more difficult to detect such as the carbon in Leclanch and Li ion batteries. Fortunately however for our purposes the containers of such batteries are detectable as they usually employ steel or nickel materials. Consequently the detection of batteries can be usually be accomplished reliably through their magnetic signature. Of course other battery detection methods are known and available including radar and chemical means.

Similarly the destruction or disablement of batteries used in IEDs can also be performed in a variety of ways. For example the materials that comprise a battery either active materials within the cell or various support materials may preferentially absorb electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths depending on the material properties.

Likewise control circuits used to operate and or regulate the battery can also be disrupted or destroyed. Consequently the wavelengths that are preferably absorbed for materials present in common batteries must be identified and characterized.

As can be appreciated the energy stored in the power supply of IED electronics is used to operate proximity and or triggering electronics communications with other IED devices or communications with terrorism data gathering networks. Command and control electronics of such devices may in fact actually control and detonate any number of IED devices.

Of further significance power supplies have one or more component s that perform two functions to reduce the potential difference the current or filter spurious power supply noise. For example during the sudden operation of a radio transmitter the peak power from the power supply to operate the transmission system suddenly ramps up providing an electromagnetic signature immediately followed by the operation of the radio. Both of these electromagnetic signatures will typically not occur in the same frequency regime and each will have very distinct characteristics but will exhibit a time correlation. Consequently such events may be used advantageously for the preliminary detection of IED s a necessary prerequisite to their disablement and or destruction.

Although the detection of an IED is of considerable benefit it is nevertheless the destruction or disablement of the IED that is most desirable. One well known method of destruction or disablement is the detonation of the device leading to its self destruction. In the case of a device triggered electronically this could in many cases be performed by triggering the device using radar or appropriate microwave transmitters at least for the crude devices likely encountered presently . Alternative detonation methods include mechanically disturbing the IED until it detonates.

While a battery or power source of an IED is detectable it is generally more difficult to deactivate than the triggering mechanism or other parts of the IED. However the control circuit associated with the battery or power supply is vulnerable to being disrupted by external means such as a RADAR system or by a sharp directed increase in a nearby electrical field.

Turning now to there is shown an overhead plan view of an area representative of that in which an Improvised Explosive Device s is are placed. For the purposes of this discussion the IED is positioned at the center of the . One or more power sources supplies batteries are depicted at the center of that figure as well.

As noted earlier the detection of the battery or other power source may be effected by a number of mechanisms. One the internal battery components may be detected by its magnetic signature and or its energy spectrum. In addition such signatures may accompany additional transmission emanations such as those which correspond to a command control signal s or data relaying operation using a transmitter.

As taught by the present invention once such a signature is obtained and a battery or other power source is detected which preferably is performed at a radial distance depicted in the FIG as r the elimination of the power source may be performed at a greater radial distance r thereby ensuring the safety of any personnel performing such task s .

Turning our attention now to there is shown a block diagram depicting the overall strategy of our inventive structure and accompanying method s . In particular a first step in identifying and locating the IED is performed via one or more methods including introducing a pulse of energy into the area and observing whether any particular characteristic signatures result. Consequently material signatures as well as electromagnetic signatures resulting from an IEDs response to a pulse of electromagnetic energy or its electromagnetic transmission and or any spectra or radiative energy produced is detected.

As part of that characteristic detection schemes observations detections are made searching for any characteristic electromagnetic chemical back scatter and or infrared signatures that are associated with particular IED s and or their power sources. As can be readily appreciated such detection schemes are not mutually exclusive and we preferably employ them in combinations that produce a wider range of reliable results.

Once a candidate IED is detected and located it is subsequently neutralized according to our inventive teachings through the effect of a shaped electromagnetic pulse directed at the IED device in such a manner that maximum energy is imparted onto into the IED device and not its surroundings. Advantageously RF waveguide structures may be employed to produce and subsequently direct the pulse s of electromagnetic energy to the IED target.

Turning now to there is shown a block diagram depicting our inventive structures and method s . More particularly shown in that is an IED power source and our localized pulse source generator and waveguide excitation structures.

As noted prior the IED may be detected in a number of ways including the detection of a characteristic chemical and or electromagnetic or magnetic signature s . And while this only shows the IED power source we are not so limiting as to imply that it is the power source we are necessarily detecting. Any of a number of characteristic signatures emanating or otherwise resulting from the IED may provide such detection location. Rather we show the IED power source here because that is the structure at which our inventive shaped pulse is directed to.

By way of some additional background at this point there has been extensive theoretical research describing localized waves LW in the form of a space time localized pulse generation and propagation in homogeneous inhomogeneous dispersive and non dispersive media. See. e.g J. B. Brittingham Focus Waves Modes in Homogeneous Maxwells Equations Transverse Electric Mode which appeared in J. Applied Physics vol. 54 pp 1179 in 1983 and R. W. Ziolkowski et al Localoized Wave Representations of Acoustic and Electromagnetic Radiation which appeared in IEEE Proceedings Vol. 79 No. 10 pp. 1371 1378 in 1991 the entire contents and teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference as if they were in length 

Accordingly and consistent with the teachings of the instant invention a space time localized pulse is synthesized at a distance r from the source location IED device . The pulse is realized through the effect s of a number of horn open ended waveguide antennas excited with pre determined modes that cover a bandwidth sufficient to produce a localized wave. Consequently once the IED is detected and its approximate location is determined the localized waves LW source is adjusted to produce a pulse of high intensity at that location. The pulse then destroys deactivates the IED. Inasmuch as the highest intensity of the pulse is produced at the specific location of the IED adjacent structures and or materials are minimally affected. The distance r in is between 50 100 feet and the intensity of the power is at least 1 watt.

The combination of the radiative pulses emitted from each of the number of open waveguide structures are combined in a Bessel like manner see such their combination is greatest at the location of the IED. In this manner the waveguides serve as a mechanism in which particular modes of EM pulses are established and directional energy is produced wherein the non destructive modes are restricted.

Of course it will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing is merely illustrative of the principles of this invention and that various modifications may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. In particular any number of waveguide structures may be provided for the waveguide excitation and advantageously they may be of any particular shape. More specifically while we have only shown cylindrical and substantially rectangular waveguides other shapes are contemplated within our inventive teachings. Still further any number of detection mechanisms and resulting IED signatures are envisioned. Accordingly our invention is to be limited only by the scope of the claims attached hereto.
