This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 034 018 entitled Data Based Awards for an Electronic Gaming Device filed Jan. 11 2005 now abandoned.

The invention relates generally to electronic gaming device. More specifically the invention relates to data based awards for an electronic gaming device.

Slot machines and video poker machines continue to be the most widely used types of gaming devices found in the gaming industry. The oldest slot machines and video poker machines were relatively simple devices which included little in the way of sound generating devices commonly including only a bell or buzzer to signify a winning combination on the reels. With the advent of new technology in the gaming industry the slot machines and video poker machines were now able to produce a variety of pre programmed sounds and video through the use of computer chip technology. These pre programmed sounds and video are of significant importance to maintaining player interest in a particular gaming machine. Consequently changes or updates to any of the game features including video audio bonusing systems or of the game itself are important. As a result the ability to change electronic games as quickly and as easily as possible to meet evolving player tastes is necessary.

In some aspects the invention relates to an electronic gaming device comprising an outcome processor that determines machine events and an award delivery device that delivers data based awards in response to the machine events.

In other aspects the invention relates to an electronic gaming device comprising an outcome processor that determines machine events and means for delivering an database award in response to the machine events.

In other aspects the invention relates to an electronic gaming device comprising means for generating electronic gaming device outputs in response to gaming device inputs means for delivering data based awards in response to gaming device inputs and means for delivering data based awards in response to gaming device outputs.

In other aspects the invention relates to an electronic gaming device comprising a processor that controls electronic gaming device outputs and responds to gaming device inputs and an award delivery device that delivers data based awards in response to gaming device inputs or gaming device outputs.

Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description and the appended claims.

It is to be understood that the present invention can be used with any type of EGD and the video poker machine is merely used as an example. Other common examples of EGDs that can be used with the present invention are slot machines with physical reels and or video displays video lottery terminals VLTs video blackjack machines video poker machines bingo machines keno machines etc.

The first mode of play involves the player depositing a wagering instrument e.g. scrip coin token paper currency digital based currency such as credit cards smart cards or any other credited digital or data based medium making a wager and manipulating the player controls if necessary or desirable to cause the EGD to determine the outcome for the wagered game and display the outcome to the player in a form relevant to the game e.g. reels spinning and stopping cards dealt drawn folded etc bingo keno lottery or sweepstakes drawings etc bonuses multipliers or any other representation indicia or image physical or simulated of a predetermined wholly skill based or an at least partially randomly determined outcome represented as a gambling game or one of its features . If for example the outcome is a winning outcome the winnings are credited to the EGD s credit balance. If the outcome is a losing outcome the player loses his wagered credits. In either case the player may play again or cash out depending on whether or not the EGD maintains a credit balance for future wagers. It should be understood that the wide variety of wagering instruments and games that are known in the art may be used in different embodiments of the present invention.

The second mode of play involves a player similarly depositing a wagering instrument in order to create a balance of credits in the EGD. Once the EGD has a credit balance the player may make a series of qualifying selections that result in the EGD determining at least one outcome for a least one chosen wagering game and or at least one bonus game. In this example the EGD outcome s is are not displayed to the player either by choice or design e.g. the reels are not visibly spun and stopped cards are not visibly dealt nor drawn folded etc bingo keno lottery or sweepstakes drawings etc bonuses multipliers or any other indicia or image physical or simulated of a predetermined wholly skill based or an at least partially randomly determined outcome represented as a gambling game or one of its features etc. . In this embodiment once the EGD determines the outcome s for the specific game s the undisclosed outcome s and or related access device s and or relevant data is are delivered to the player via a data based medium in this case a printed ticket.

For this example the printed ticket will be one that is compatible with ticket in ticket out TITO systems. It is to be understood that TITO compatibility is not a requirement for the present invention. It is used here by example only. Any suitable system known in art that provides cashless instruments for payment of credit or cash balances bonuses prizes merchandise etc. may be employed. The printed ticket will contain the necessary identification components for the TITO system to recognize it once it is offered for redemption in a TITO compatible EGD or it is otherwise redeemed with a TITO system supported device in the absence of an alternate form of payment e.g. coins hand pay etc. . The ticket has a credit value equal to the net credit balance of the undisclosed wagering outcome s . The ticket also contains at least a portion of the information required to allow the holder of the ticket to reveal the undisclosed outcome s for the purchased wagering game s at a later time with or without a casino EGD. The information on the ticket may include a website address access codes outcomes outcome presentation data player identifying information or any other information or data that allows access to a data file containing the corresponding credit balance and or outcome information of all types etc. The data file may be stored in memory in the EGD a central memory storage location that is part of a network etc.

Some jurisdictions may require that the value of the ticket be prominently displayed or be readily viewable. However in order to preserve a player s level of anticipation prior to revealing his undisclosed outcomes and their cumulative value techniques that conceal the value printed on or otherwise imbued to the ticket may be employed. One example is to print the amount with an ink or in a treated or specifically manufactured area of the ticket that renders the representative characters invisible to the naked eye until a catalyst is employed. The catalyst could be light waves as from a black light that render the characters legible a chemical the act of scratching etc. Another example involves using stock with a removable carbon paper type layer where the value of the ticket will have been transferred to the substrate adjacent to the carbon paper . Peeling away the carbon paper layer which will have transferred alpha numeric characters to a substrate of the ticket in response to pressure heat light or other activating agent action and or device will reveal the value of the ticket.

In one example the player can receive a copy of a program specifically designed to display the outcomes through one of the player s electronic devices like a PC cellular telephone XBOX or PDA. This program could be gifted to the player or purchased by the player in the form of traditional software media e.g. CD DVD game console disk for video game platforms etc. or it could be offered as a download to a device with a display such as a cellular phone PDA hand held game console PC etc. The outcomes could also be displayed via an interactive DVD or interactive TV programming for use with a television or other compatible monitor. Many of the devices such as the hand held game console may also be specifically manufactured and programmed for this purpose. The display program may also be accessible via the Internet or directly from the EGD.

The previous example referencing the display program for undisclosed outcomes being delivered from the EGD of the present invention to the player is an example of a data based award DBA of the present invention. In that example the display program may be delivered to the player via any suitable data transfer system such as those with physical connections or wireless connections. For example a USB port or other digital media reader and or writer located in an easily accessible position on the EGD is a suitable connection point. With this sample connection point the DBA could be transferred through the USB port to any compatible device including USB flash drives secure digital SD memory cards other compact flash devices PDAs cellular telephones hand held game consoles or any electronic storage medium or device capable of connecting directly or through a USB cable to the EGD.

Another example involves a system e.g. player tracking cashless web based purpose built DBA delivery system or an EGD sending a DBA to a player s email account cellular telephone. PDA etc. upon the player earning winning or otherwise qualifying for the DBA. This can be accomplished by using stored player contact information so long as the player has been identified by the system EGD etc. prior to his qualifying for the DBA. The information could also be provided to the system. EGD etc. by manually inputting the information via an input of the system EGD etc. or the necessary contact information could be sent via a cellular phone email program text messaging etc. to the system. EGD etc. upon request.

A DBA may be an entire program complete content etc. or it may constitute a digital key of some type that provides access to a downloadable award and or unlocks a downloadable award or unlocks an award delivered in and or contained by another form such as CD DVD or any other storage media. Examples of data based awards include all types of software for PCs e.g. game programs business software word processors photography programs entertainment programs EGD outcome display programs undisclosed EGD outcomes or any other software based applications etc. GPS programs cellular phone programming e.g. ring tones screensavers games undisclosed EGD outcome display programs undisclosed EGD outcomes etc. audio files e.g. MP3 WMA AAC files etc. video games additional video game content movies TV episodes undisclosed outcomes for EGDs display programs for undisclosed EGD outcomes player tracking points bonus games image files or any digitized or data based item etc.

For example an EGD may be themed after a movie such as Star Wars . In this case after a particular award is won or earned e.g. through game play outcomes bonusing player tracking measures etc. the EGD would provide a copy of the movie or a digital key to a player s digital storage device as a form of a payout or bonus. The copy of the movie or some type of digital key used for downloading or retrieval of the movie from the Internet a kiosk or other partially or wholly automated distribution center can be saved directly to a player s digital storage device and or medium such as a USB flash drive for example. In one example the movie could be accessed by a player with his home PC connected to the Internet. A digital key stored in a USB flash drive can be programmed to automatically connect to the appropriate web site and initiate downloading of the movie to the player s PC upon insertion of the flash drive to a USB port on or connected to the player s PC. The movie could then be downloaded to the player s PC and or to a preferred storage media such as a DVD disk. A digital key may also be a code or password that allows access to a web page that provides the appropriate downloads.

Similarly a display program for displaying undisclosed EGD outcomes can be downloaded to a player s data storage device in whole or part. A digital key can also be provided to the player s data storage device that allows access to an appropriate website for downloading and or operating the display program. The display program would be programmed to display the player s undisclosed EGD outcomes as they were provided or in various other forms.

Another example of data based awards are audio files containing music audio novels etc. Again any compatible electronic transfer and storage device may be employed to receive the award from the EGD. One example would be a digital audio player such as an MP3 player to store the audio files directly from the EGD or a kiosk or other partially or wholly automated distribution center. Audio files like all examples of data based awards could also be downloaded from the Internet with a digital key proprietary website link or the like or they could be delivered by an award distribution center after the player provides a digital key.

Automated distribution centers such as a kiosk can deliver DBAs upon receipt of a digital key and or command from a player a cashless instrument a digital storage device an EGD a central determination system CDS a player tracking system a cashless system a display program for an undisclosed outcome a website or any other system connected to an EGD. The digital key may also contain commands for the distribution center that instruct the center which data based award to deliver and in what form fashion etc. Interconnected data based award distribution systems may be comprised using any number of the above items and or additional items.

The EGD of the present invention can also deliver to a player s digital storage medium and or device player tracking points and or all manner of the player s account information and or a digital key that allows a player to access his player account. In one example the player account access is an award in the form of a manageable player account and or player account program. The player account may be available on line via a website or off line for use with the player s PC PDA or other compatible electronic device that receives stores organizes retrieves and displays the player s player account data. Additionally it is to be understood that the player s data storage device can be used to store and deliver credit balance information to an EGD for play or to a redemption device including EGDs for cashing out.

The EGD of the present invention is compatible with player data storage devices of the present invention that are capable of combining all player tracking data all EGD accounting data including all scrip related data all data based award data and all undisclosed outcome data. Examples include such measures as coin in coin out number of visits time dates of visits games played all types of point balances player identification data game outcomes DBA file type etc.

The data storage devices will be programmable and capable of segmenting various data and functions with appropriate access limitations for security purposes using various programming and or circuitry tools and or configurations including logic gates application programming interfaces APIs HKEYs hashing etc. Such a device will also be capable of storing and updating information that is opaque to the player. Such information can be retrieved and used by an operator or its agent for business analyses of the player or portions of it can be used for the player s tax purposes for example. The retrieval of all information by the operator can occur at an EGD point of sale redemption center etc. upon connection of the data storage device a telecommunication connection or via the Internet when the player has connected the device to an Internet compatible device such as a PC cellular phone PDA game console etc.

The information retrieved will include all traditional player tracking measures accumulated while the player utilizes an operator s in house attractions and also include information from EGDs table games sports betting simulcast wagering retail purchases complimentaries or comps redeemed and or acquired comps may be credited directly to the data storage device by a host with an electronic device designed for that purpose by an EGD by a player account interface in house and or on line etc. and Internet activity including display program activity for undisclosed outcomes activity on the operator s website general and or specific Internet data mining information etc. A DBA sent to a cellular phone for example could be a screensaver with a particular appearance and or message that is recognizable by casino staff as good for a complimentary dinner show or other type of pass ticket or coupon and or otherwise representative of a player s status.

Any use of the data storage device can be retrieved. It is to be understood that the data storage device is capable of receiving and storing data such as that listed above in a segmented or un segmented fashion with or without onboard programming for ultimate retrieval by the operator an agent of the operator and or the player. Certain portions of the data storage device may only be accessible to entities devices and or systems as designated by the operator its agent or the player. The device may include security measures and or mechanisms to prevent access by unauthorized parties. Such measures may include requiring an access code such as a personal identification number from the player to be entered at any or all points of use such as at an EGD PC alternate display device payment center award distribution center etc. or biometric measures such as a fingerprint reader on the storage device or EGD for example where the owner s fingerprint can be compared to one that is stored in the storage device or in a system file associated with the storage device may be included.

The data storage device also can contain programs that will automatically boot once the device is connected to a processing device such as a PC cellular phone PDA game console digital audio player hand held game EGD player tracking system etc. For example upon connection to the player s home PC a bootable program may automatically take the player to a particular website deliver a particular message etc. Additionally a program that tracks and saves the activity on the data storage device may send tracked activity to a player tracking system via the Internet telephone networks etc. Another example is when a player connects his data storage device to an EGD a bootable command may be delivered to the EGD s processor to initiate a bonus game a personal welcome player identification a player tracking routine or an audio and or visual output or other output in response to a player s activity in the casino away from the casino on line any other activity conducted with the data storage device etc. Another example allows a player to have choose or automatically boot custom audio and video display options for an EGD such as applying computer wallpapers to the EGD while he is engaging the EGD.

In order to display undisclosed outcomes information from the player s cashless instrument will need to be transferred to the display device and or system. The player may also be required to provide some amount of identifying information such as a personal identification number PIN user ID password name phone number address etc. Once the display mechanism and or system has the information or access to the information it needs including the outcome s and or cumulative balance of the outcome s relative to the purchased wager s the player is able to engage the mechanism s player controls in a similar fashion as he would engage an EGD s player controls. At this point the player is able to replay the previously wagered game s with the previously determined undisclosed outcomes displaying them at his leisure in a location of his choice.

Using the example in a player first engages the EGD by selecting the mode of play desired . If the player chooses to display the outcomes the EGD will play in a conventional manner . Assuming the player chooses to purchase 300 worth of wagers for a corresponding number of undisplayed outcomes he will first deposit currency or credits . Once deposited the credits will be assigned to the EGD for play or cash out . At this point the player will have the option to make a series of qualifying selections and such as selecting the value of each wager and or the number of games to be wagered on and or the specific game or games to be wagered on. The qualifying selections and may not be required in some instances. For example an alternate outcome revelation program may only work with a specific game and or a specific wager amount. The program may only replicate the exact game from which the unrevealed outcomes were purchased.

For the purposes of this example the player chooses one hundred 3 wagers which in this case constitute 100 max coin wagers. Once qualifying selections have been made either automatically or by the player the outcome determining mechanism associated with the EGD be it a component of the EGD or part of a centralized determination system where the EGD is simply a client terminal and display for the system determines the winning and losing outcomes for each of the 100 wagers more or less instantly from the player s perspective without disclosing any of the outcomes to the player.

Thereafter for this example the EGD prints at least one ticket of the type used with ticket in ticket out TITO systems. If one ticket is printed the ticket will be coded with the cash out balance from the player in this case 300 minus the sum of all wagers lost plus the sum of all wagers won . If multiple tickets are printed the sum of the tickets will also equal 300 minus the sum of all wagers lost plus the sum of all wagers won . Additionally the at least one ticket and or a related ticket s issued separately will also contain some additional components required to enable the revealing of the 100 game outcomes away from the EGD or at a later time with the EGD . Some of the additional ticket components necessary for revelation of the outcomes can be identifiers specific to the player such as player tracking account information digital codes and or printed codes intended to aid later access to outcome revealing devices and or their systems such as PCs cellular phones PDAs video game console platforms XBOX PS2 Gamecube etc. hand held video game platforms Gameboy Sony PSP Nintendo DS etc. Internet websites interactive TV EGDs etc.

TITO tickets are used in many of the examples contained herein however it should be noted that the terms such as ticket scrip and cashless instrument are interchangeable as used herein so long as the specific media type employed can transport the data necessary for the present invention. Though paper tickets are the prevailing media in use today it is to be understood that any alternative that is capable of storing transporting and or delivering the data necessary are intended for use with the present invention. Some examples of alternate media are smart cards magnetically striped cards RFID equipped devices or tickets wireless communication devices like cellular phones and PDAs DVDs CDs USB flash memory devices secure digital SD memory cards other flash or compact flash devices etc.

It is to be understood that TITO systems vary somewhat from manufacturer to manufacturer and version to version. Typically there will be a plurality of EGDs that are connected to a centralized accounting system also known as a cashless system. The accounting system will code tickets with secure identifying information and representative value usually with a bar code printed numerals and or alphabetic characters as they are printed. The system will contemporaneously create a matching liability file for the un cashed scrip account which will remain open until the ticket is redeemed by an EGD or other device connected to the system or it expires. Upon redemption the ticket is compared to the outstanding liability file and if they match credits currency or some other equally valuable instrument will be delivered or credited to the holder of the ticket. Redemption can occur via an EGD or other device connected to the system the EGD or manually with a casino cashier who has access to the system.

Continuing with the example shown in the player may use the at least one ticket at any time with a TITO capable device that is part of the same system from which the ticket s was were issued . Upon insertion of the ticket s the player may assign the credit balance to the selected device such as an EGD for further play or display the outcomes with the device . If the balance is assigned to a device for further play the associated credit balance if any will be credited to the machine in a normal fashion . It is also possible that the ticket may not be tenderable for a given period and or until the outcomes have been revealed by the player depending on the EGD operator s preference.

An alternative is for the player to take his scrip that contains at least a portion of the data representing the sum of his wagers winnings and losses and or at least a portion of the data that will provide access to an alternate outcome revealing device and or system away from the EGD to employ at his leisure. An example of this alternative is depicted in . In this option the player accesses a display program located on a secure website. There are many other options including other EGDs internet websites off line programming e.g. a home computer with the appropriate software cellular phones game consoles PDAs etc. In this example the player accesses the website and validates the scrip containing the undisplayed outcome data. If the access code is invalid the player is denied further access to the website . Once the player correctly validates the scrip further access to the website is granted and the balance of the scrip account if any is loaded as credits . The player may be given the option of selecting different gambling games if they are available and supported by the website. The player then makes the qualifying selections for the gaming wagers and . Next the website simulates the determination of an outcome of the gambling game . In this example it is important to understand that the outcome determination is only simulated for the player s enjoyment and entertainment. The actual outcome has already been determined by the EGD as shown in . After the outcome of the wager is displayed the player may continue to play the game or play an alternative game until the credit balance of the undisplayed outcome is exhausted. Once play stops the player may exit the website by simply logging out . It is possible in some embodiments of the invention for the player to exit the website with only some of the outcomes displayed. In this case the scrip account can be updated for later access by the player . This can continue until all of the outcomes are eventually displayed to the player.

Examples of the present invention are represented in and . In the EGD includes an outcome generator a processor used to monitor EGD activity and generate commands player controls an audio speaker a display a player tracking panel payment accepting equipment with a cashless instrument accepting device and payment delivery equipment . Though the EGD may be in communication with multiple systems such as player tracking systems progressive systems etc. the focus of this example is directed to the EGD in connection with a cashless system and an outcome display device .

The processor is designed and programmed to monitor among other things EGD outcomes. When an EGD and or CDS is engaged in generating and delivering a group of undisplayed outcomes and their individual and or cumulative results to a player the processor will record the outcomes with their relevant data e.g. value s wager bonus eligibility bonus outcome game presentation data etc. . This data can be accessed for delivery and coding of the cashless instrument and is also available for later retrieval in response to display device requests via a network. The network will likely be secure and use suitable protocols. The network may be any suitable network including a LAN WAN intranet wireless RF and or Internet etc.

EGD awards payments for winning outcomes that exceed federal withholding requirements and or other legal and or jurisdictional and or vendor thresholds often require an EGD to enter a tilt state in which the machine is rendered unresponsive to the player. In these cases payment may be delayed until an EGD s result is verified by casino staff or other agents regulators vendor representatives etc. . In light of the present invention if a purchased undisplayed outcome exceeds such a threshold the EGD may be programmed to display that outcome and enter a tilted state prior to or in lieu of issuing a corresponding cashless instrument associated with the undisplayed outcome. Alternatively the cashless system may simply account for the outcome and initiate any verification procedures if necessary without the knowledge of the player.

Using a progressive jackpot as an example the progressive award can be automatically or manually assigned to the liability file that corresponds to the scrip issued to the player whereafter the undisplayed outcome and its partial or complete value can be displayed to the player at a later time by outcome display devices as described herein. If the player s identity is immediately required upon winning an award that exceeds a threshold it may be preferable for the player to identify himself prior to purchasing an undisplayed outcome. This may be accomplished with approved identification measures that ensure the player of the device is also the holder of the outcome. Such measures may include requiring personal identifiers including signing in prior to purchase an access code driver s license comparison or biometric identification data from the player fingerprints retinal scan facial recognition etc. . These measures may be conducted at any or all points of use such as at an EGD PC alternate display device payment center award distribution center cashless instrument etc. If the verification of a player s identity is only required upon redemption of a cashless instrument a player may have his identity verified when the scrip associated with an undisplayed outcome that exceeds a given threshold is redeemed.

In the embodiment shown in a player utilizes an outcome display device in connection with a gambling game simulation program which is employed to display the previously determined outcomes. In order for the gambling game simulation to simulate and or display the previously determined outcome it will access compiled undisplayed outcome data from the cashless instrument and or the processor via the Internet telephone networks wirelessly etc. Upon connection a valid cashless instrument will be verified by the cashless system and or the processor . After verification of the cashless instrument and or the player the processor provides at least one specific outcome and credit balance associated with the cashless instrument to the gambling game simulation program . At this point the gambling game simulation program is in condition for play. The player will then have the option to select a gambling game if more than one is available and simulate placing his wagers and view the simulation of his selected gambling game as it simulates outcomes and or replays actual outcomes as they occurred earlier though they were undisplayed at that time.

In the example shown in the EGD outcomes are determined by a central determination system CDS that is separate from the EGD . This may result in a different communication layout for certain portions of the network. With this example the EGD does not include an outcome determining mechanism and may or may not house the processor used to monitor EGD activity and generate commands . This processor may be incorporated in the CDS or be a part of a separate device and or system connected to the EGD and or CDS.

It is to be understood that a player may also have his outcomes revealed by an EGD at a later time if he so desires. This could come about if the player had initially intended on revealing the outcomes at home for example but instead returned to the casino where he received the undisplayed outcomes before he had a chance to reveal them at home. In this case the player may want to display the outcomes already purchased prior to or instead of wagering additional credits. He would only need to deliver the scrip to an EGD via a ticket reader or other suitable data transmission connection on the same network as from before where the EGD of the present invention is able to display the games associated with the undisclosed outcomes represented on the scrip for play to the player as if they had never been played but where the outcomes displayed are those that were determined at an earlier time.

Another option with the present invention allows the player to continue wagering with the display device and or system using the winnings he may have acquired with the purchase of his undisclosed outcomes with or without disclosing the undisclosed outcomes. For example where one use is to limit the player s winnings and or losses to a value that is stored in or available through his cashless instrument after purchasing at least one undisclosed outcome from an EGD another example is to allow the player to wager his winnings if the cumulative value of his undisclosed outcome s is are more than 0 with a remote gaming engine RGE available through the various devices and systems such as those referenced herein. This option will require a dynamic form of scrip accounting in order to update the value represented by the cashless instrument and or its liability account. It is also to be understood that this type of wagering is not to be limited to wagering winnings from previously purchased wagers such as undisclosed outcomes. Credits purchased at an EGD or other allowable point of sale where the player receives an instrument that allows him access to the RGE may also be wagered on line and redeemed in a similar fashion.

For example using non electronic paper scrip with a dynamic scrip account of the present invention can be accomplished among other methods by using an on line undisclosed outcome display program with a remote game engine RGE in connection with a cashless system associated with the EGD that originally delivered the scrip representing the undisclosed outcome s . If for example the original scrip and its related scrip liability account held a value for the player in the amount of 100 the player might wish to wager any or all of the 100 via the on line outcome display program and the RGE in addition to or in lieu of displaying the related undisplayed outcomes. If after wagering the value of the scrip changed the related liability account would be updated to reflect its new balance. The paper scrip in this example would then be redeemable for the new monetary value.

The display program RGE and or the scrip liability account may also be programmed to allow the player to wager more than the value of the scrip in a credit or debit arrangement including using comp and or player s club points and or involving a payment using comp and or player s club points. Additionally a negative balance could be paid at the EGD or at any other acceptable location or in any other acceptable fashion partially wholly or manually connected to the cashless system that issued the original scrip and established its related liability account. A player may similarly wager his winnings if using a cashless instrument other than non electronic paper scrip or tickets. For example using a digital storage device as a cashless instrument the player may also wager via a remote gaming engine RGE .

A remote gaming engine is a gambling game outcome determination processor. It may be located in an EGD a CDS an undisclosed outcome display program and or device stand alone off line programming available to one of the player s display devices etc. The outcome determination processor may be accessed via a network like the Internet using physical or wireless communication equipment. The RGE will also contain or work in conjunction with creative content programming. The RGE may be accessible via a network or via a stand alone device programmed for use with the present invention. In the event a player is utilizing an off line RGE his cashless instrument may be updated or generated e.g. printed scrip digital media like CD USB flash drive etc. with credit balance changes to his account and or the RGE may require a connection to a central scrip liability account to transmit credit balance changes.

In one embodiment the processor used to monitor EGD activity and generate commands is embodied by an activity monitoring unit AMU . It is to be understood that it is the function of the processor that is critical to the invention and not its precise construction nor physical location. The AMU is designed and programmed to similarly monitor among other things EGD outcomes. When an EGD and or a CDS are engaged in generating and delivering a group of undisplayed outcomes and their individual and or cumulative results to a player the AMU will record the outcomes with their relevant data e.g. value s wager bonus eligibility bonus outcome game presentation data etc. This data can be accessed for delivery and coding of a cashless instrument and is also available for later retrieval in response to game display program requests via a network. The network will likely be secure and use suitable protocols. The network may be any suitable network including a LAN WAN intranet wireless RF and or Internet.

In one embodiment when a player utilizes an outcome display device it is in connection with a web based gambling game simulation which is employed to display the previously determined undisclosed outcomes. In order for the gambling game simulation to simulate the previously determined undisclosed outcome s it will access compiled undisclosed outcome data stored in a memory device controlled by the processor tasked to handle the activity monitoring and command generating functions for the EGD and or the CDS via a secure Internet connection. Upon connection a valid cashless instrument will be verified by the cashless system and or the processor .

After verification of the cashless instrument the processor in concert with the cashless system provides at least one specific outcome and related data e.g. size of wager s win loss information outcome total number of credits played EGD location gaming establishment time and date of issue game program game theme game presentation data bonus data player information etc. associated with the cashless instrument to the gambling game simulation program . The player will then have the option to select a gambling game if more than one is available and simulate placing his wagers playing the game and viewing the simulation of his selected gambling game as it simulates and or replays actual outcomes that occurred earlier though they were undisplayed at that time. Additionally the display device of the present invention may offer the player a choice between applying the credit balance and allowing the display of the outcomes prior to informing the player of the associated credit balance so as not to spoil the ending for the player.

An EGD of the present invention can display outcomes that were determined at an earlier point in time upon receiving the necessary data from or through the cashless instrument containing the data related to those outcomes. A gaming system such as a video lottery or bingo system can be established where there would exist at least one EGD and or system that allowed the purchase of at least one undisclosed outcome where the EGD would deliver to a player at least one cashless instrument for use with EGDs of the proxy display variety such as some types of 1 video lottery terminals VLTs or 2 class II and III gaming devices. These will be located in a jurisdictionally approved site and or will be for use with alternate outcome revealing devices. One potential use for such an arrangement is for jurisdictions that limit the number of EGDs a given licensee may operate. If for example a gaming operator were limited to 500 EGDs the operator could place 500 EGDs that independently or in concert with a central system generate undisclosed outcomes and additionally place any number of display devices that could have any appearance including identical external appearances player interface and display qualities as the allowable EGDs. The display devices could be operated to display the previously purchased undisplayed outcomes in a manner that from the player s perspective simulates playing a traditional EGD. In this way the operation can effectively meet its market s demand for gaming positions while complying with its jurisdictional limits on quantity of EGDs.

This example fits well with present day Native American casino systems such as those found in the State of Washington where cash must be converted to scrip for use with EGDs connected to a CDS. The EGDs in at least some Washington casinos only accept scrip for wagers. The scrip is issued from a single purpose device which is connected to the cashless system. This device accepts cash and issues scrip with an equal value. In this example the device that converts cash to scrip in concert with its CDS and or cashless system could generate undisplayed outcomes and store them in whole or part in a system based scrip account or on the scrip itself. Thereafter the devices played would be simply display devices with at least the ability to accept and deliver scrip. In one example when scrip is inserted into a display device the CDS would access the relevant scrip account and display an outcome to the player thereafter updating the scrip account to be representative of the value assigned to the remaining undisplayed outcomes and or crediting the display device. If a winning outcome were purchased and displayed the credits won could be assigned to another scrip account where the appropriate number of new undisplayed outcomes could be generated simultaneously. Additionally scrip can be issued for payment for all winnings displayed at the time a player decides to stop displaying outcomes as to any remaining undisclosed outcomes the credits wagered may be refunded or the balance of the undisclosed outcomes may be paid out as if they had been displayed to the player. In the case of a progressive award a separate scrip account can be created where the corresponding scrip would be delivered to the player via the display device or the progressive award can be delivered by casino personnel.

The outcomes may be revealed by an EGD or by alternate display devices. As previously described for all alternate display devices and or systems the credit balance associated with the scrip may or may not be shown to the player depending on the programming of the display device and or system and or the player s choice prior to displaying the outcomes. In addition to EGDs display of the outcomes of the present invention may be through devices and systems such as PCs cellular telephones PDAs video game console platforms e.g. XBOX PS2 Gamecube etc. hand held video game platforms e.g. Gameboy Sony PSP Nintendo DS etc. Internet websites interactive TV etc. For Internet capable devices the display program may be a web based program provided by a casino or its agent housing the EGD s that provided the undisclosed outcomes via scrip.

In one example the website requires identifying data from the scrip. Once provided the website can access the casino system to determine the games originally wagered on the number and size of the wagers and their outcomes. Alternatively the website program similar to a stand alone program can acquire this information without accessing the casino system so long as the necessary qualifiers are represented by the scrip or other data based medium and can be transferred to the website program. Additionally the data entered from the scrip may only need to communicate the number and size of the wagers and their outcomes or cumulative outcome and thereafter allow the player to select the games he wants to play. The program will then apply the previously determined outcomes or cumulative outcome to those games.

The outcome display programming regardless of its location may house a library of gambling games from which the player may choose to reveal his previously purchased outcomes. The gambling game may or may not be required to be the same type of game found on the EGD from which the undisplayed outcomes were originally purchased. In fact the EGD may or may not have offered a particular program or programs to choose from or play these and all other limitations may be left in whole or part to the display programming of the display device.

A theoretical payback percentage can be applied to an undisplayed outcome s . A corresponding pay table may be representative of all games offered by the display device and or system. Alternatively the pay table may be adjustable for particular games offered by the display device and or system so long as the net credit balance of the undisplayed outcome s is achieved.

The display program may be a program that can be downloaded from a website or installed from a CD DVD flash memory device or proprietary data storage device such as those used with most hand held game platforms etc. In this case the program can work independently from a web based program and or a casino system or it can work in concert with one or both so long as the display program is functional with the outcome related data and or qualifiers available on or through the scrip. The same is applicable for devices such as PCs cellular phones PDAs and game consoles that have Internet capability and the ability to operate with installed programs. Hand held game platforms such as Sony s PSP and or custom hand held electronic games the latter generally mass produced and used for single purpose games such as poker solitaire etc. have the ability to operate with installed programs and or integrated programs that can also display the outcomes.

It is important to understand that some of these examples give the player an experience of gambling in the present even though the wagers were purchased and the outcomes were determined in the past. The alternative display of the outcomes can provide an experience that is close to or identical to that of playing an EGD in a casino at a later time or without being there. A gambling game s creative content can easily be modified or simulated for an alternate display device or system.

Additional game material may be offered for players of the alternate displays. Alternate display outcome information data prizes bonuses entries etc. may also be printed from the player s home printer. For example with some undisplayed outcome embodiments any instance or combination of games plays wins losses and bonuses etc. can occur with the alternate outcome display mechanisms so long as the net result of the activity equals the value previously assigned to the cashless instrument by the EGD.

Undisclosed outcome display programming for card games such as all variations of poker and Blackjack are also possible. For example an undisplayed outcome for a partially skill based game could be provided automatically by the EGD outcome determining device by utilizing optimal play selections on behalf of the player. Partially skill based game payback percentages are typically based on optimal play by the player. That is typically the theoretical payback percentage is the highest possible actual payback percentage after a certain number of plays a.k.a. a cycle have occurred with a particular program. Over that cycle of plays the player can only negatively affect the actual payback percentage as compared to the theoretical payback percentage by making less than optimal play selections his actual results cannot exceed the theoretical payback percentage over a full game cycle . If the player with previously purchased undisplayed outcomes operated a display program with less than optimal skill the result could be the display program showing fewer credits for the player than are actually credited to the scrip. In this case the difference could be made up by bonus plays or bonus screens until the player s display program credits matched the actual number of credits assigned to the scrip. The display program may also show the deficit and the actual number of credits assigned to the scrip though the value of the scrip will remain unchanged. This may be done to help teach optimal play strategy for skill based EGD s. The hands where the player made less than optimal selections may be shown again to point out mistakes and to show the optimal choices that should have been made.

Card games such as poker and Black Jack for example can simulate multiple virtual players and or a virtual dealer gambling at a virtual table with the actual player or his avatar. In one example the actual player s outcome will have been determined when the undisclosed outcome was generated. For example if the actual player s undisclosed outcome amounted to ten dollars won the simulated poker or Black Jack game will result in the player winning a hand and or pot valued at ten dollars. The presentation or the virtual players and or virtual dealer s hands will be calculated to mimic winning or losing hands in relation to the actual player s hand and relative to the rules of the game being used for display purposes and the actual player s previously determined winning or losing undisplayed outcome. Furthermore the present invention enables multiple players of a gambling game to compete against one another using their respective undisplayed outcomes. In a poker game example a player can purchase an undisplayed outcome or hand at the casino where each possible hand is ranked relative to the particular game s rules. The player is then able to engage one or more players who also have undisplayed outcomes. The players display devices will display each player s position and cards as they are revealed. An algorithm in the system will calculate finishing positions for each of the players based on their undisplayed outcomes. The final ranking of the hands will be translated to corresponding faces of cards consistent with the game for the players to see in the order they are revealed. The winner will have the winnings and or a bonus associated with his predetermined outcome revealed in the form of a pot .

It is to be understood that something of a reverse flow where jurisdictionally appropriate may also be employed. In this example undisplayed outcomes or displayed outcomes may be purchased in advance of a trip to a casino. The player may desire to wager for example via a casino s Internet web site prior to visiting the casino. The player would either purchase credits draw on an existing credit balance scrip or other player tracking balance etc. The player would then select a game make a wager and play the game. Then the casino system would engage an appropriate outcome determining device to generate the outcome for the game.

If the outcome were to be displayed it would be simulated on the player s PC where the player might be required to visit the casino in order to collect his or her winnings. If the outcome were to remain undisplayed or partially undisplayed the player would be required to go to the casino in the future in order to have the game outcome displayed by an EGD of the present invention. Additionally a partially undisplayed outcome may entice a player to visit a casino sooner. Partially displaying an outcome may also be an effective method to further comply with Internet gambling laws and regulations. In both cases the outcome would be stored by the appropriate EGD system s and or cashless instrument for future player redemption and outcome display purposes after appropriate identification of the player and or delivery of required data from a cashless instrument electronic data storage device. Electronic data storage devices may be employed for player verification and outcome matching purposes.

For example after an outcome is purchased the system may send a data key to be stored on an appropriate device or instrument. The key could be in the form of a bar code printed from the player s printer or it may be a digital key stored on some form of electronic media e.g. CD DVD floppy disk USB flash drive SD memory card other compact flash devices PCMCIA card etc. At the casino the data key may be verified by an attendant a device for that purpose or by a properly equipped EGD prior to displaying an outcome or redeeming credits.

Another use for the present invention involves a player earning undisplayed outcomes based on the player s gambling activity inclusive of all standard player tracking measures like coin in win loss record the number of visits made within a given period of time time of day playing randomly the player s responsiveness to promotions or invitations group classifications etc. The earned undisplayed outcomes can be accumulated with or without the player s knowledge at a rate and in a fashion determined by the operator. The number of earned undisclosed outcomes and their cumulative value may or may not be made available to the player at the operator s discretion and within jurisdictional guidelines. The undisclosed outcomes can be mailed emailed made available through an on line player account instant messaged provided through an EGD via a cashless instrument electronic storage media etc. to a player for remote revelation of the outcomes or for revelation on an EGD at the gaming establishment. If the outcome is revealed off site redeeming a winning outcome may or may not require a return visit to the casino. The undisclosed outcome and or its value may be provided in a form that is redeemable or tenderable at locations other than the gaming establishment. For example the undisclosed outcome and or its value may be delivered in the form of a check or bank draft a gift card to an alternate place of business a coupon a credit to the player s credit card account a pre funded credit card etc. A related cashless instrument may be generated by the player with a home printer for example or a digital based cashless instrument that can be updated with relevant data e.g. value of scrip cashless instrument identifying information player identifying information casino information scrip liability account matching information etc. . In the case of an EGD delivering earned undisclosed outcomes to a player the value balance associated with the undisclosed outcomes may be in the form of credits that must be played off the EGD and cannot be cashed out. Similarly the value balance may be delivered via a cashless instrument whose credits must be played versus cashed out. Alternatively the EGD can deliver the undisclosed outcomes via a cashless instrument in various forms and methods including those described herein.

The value associated with a cashless instrument may be redeemed online for example. In one embodiment after the player has accessed a website e.g. or and provided the cashless instrument s identifying and or quantifying data the site may make available to the player various redemption options including cash bank drafts crediting functions coupons and award selections including merchandise. The player could select any merchandise or item available for order delivery and or pick up. A short list of examples includes jewelry appliances electronic equipment vehicles consumables etc. The items may be provided at discounts that the player might not enjoy without using a cashless instrument through a given operator s system. After the player utilizes some or all of the value initially associated with the cashless instrument the liability account associated with the cashless instrument will be updated with the new value balance. Another option will be for another cashless instrument and related liability account to be generated with a value equal to the remaining value of the original cashless instrument while simultaneously closing the original liability account. The new cashless instrument may be printed by the player on his home printer for example. Another option is for the player s data storage device or electronic cashless instrument if different to receive a new digital value in response to the transaction and in relation to the new liability account. The data storage device will also be capable of maintaining a record of the transactions including the exchange of value for any web based item or merchandise.

Player tracking award systems typically allot points to a player s account based on tracked wagers. These points are typically redeemable for cash credits coupons merchandise etc. Some operators and systems allow a player to have access to and control of at least some of their points to redeem as the player chooses. Additionally some points may be accumulated accounted for and saved without the player s knowledge for reward purposes intended to make the player feel special such as complimentaries a.k.a. comp points or as a form of insurance that can be used to offset the cost of placating the player if he is disgruntled some time in the future encouraging him to visit after a long period of inactivity etc. With the present invention player points could be applied to purchasing undisclosed outcomes in lieu of or in addition to point accumulation for purchasing or being awarded standard awards.

For example once an undisplayed outcome is earned the EGD or CDS generates the undisplayed outcome automatically with or without the player s knowledge from any game or group of games the EGD operator chooses. In this example the cost of the wager is deducted from one of the player s accounts prior to the undisplayed outcome s generation. Undisplayed outcomes such as these can be banked by the casino with our without the player s direct knowledge and thereafter be given to the player. An undisplayed outcome may be delivered to a player immediately while he is playing an EGD similar to a free play or via a cashless instrument. The undisclosed outcome can be delivered through the mail in the form of a cashless instrument emailed or delivered in any other reasonable manner including the examples disclosed in other parts of the specification. The game program used to display the undisplayed outcome may be a new game one the player has not played or any other game available as determined in advance by the relevant regulatory body casino operator EGD manufacturer or an agent of any etc. The EGD operator may have a desire to introduce the player to a new game and prefer to utilize this method in place of other less direct introduction techniques. Furthermore the game chosen may have a particular payback percentage pay table etc. to result in a planned experience for the player. This could be done in place of sending a coupon with a given value so that the player receives the same or similar value after having the opportunity of revealing an undisplayed outcome. In essence the player will have chosen to make the wager with the player s club points by virtue of enrollment in the player s club or otherwise and allowed the operator to pick the game in this example. And at some point in the future the player will be allowed to reveal the associated outcome winning or losing experience the game and redeem his points whether or not the player is in the casino. Additionally a casino may budget a target amount for an advertising promotion where the amount budgeted will equal more or less the cost of paying out players earned or won undisplayed outcomes. The odds for the outcome generation program used to generate the undisplayed outcomes for this promotion can be set to provide a minimum award for all recipients randomly determined awards including large awards etc.

Undisplayed outcomes may also be won as part of a standard payout function or as a bonus. The won undisplayed outcomes can be accumulated with or without the player s immediate knowledge. The won undisclosed outcomes and their cumulative value may or may not be made immediately available to the player at the operator s discretion and within jurisdictional guidelines. The undisclosed outcomes can be mailed emailed made available through an on line player account instant messaged and provided through an EGD via a cashless instrument etc. to a player for revelation of the outcomes. In this case revealing and or redeeming any winning undisclosed outcomes may or may not require a return visit to the casino. The undisclosed outcome and or its value may be provided in a form that is redeemable or tenderable at locations other than the gaming establishment. For example the undisclosed outcome and or its value may be delivered in the form of a check or bank draft a gift card to an alternate place of business a credit to the player s credit card account a pre funded credit card etc. A related cashless instrument may be generated by the player with a home printer for example or a digital based cashless instrument that can be updated with relevant data e.g. value of scrip cashless instrument identifying information player identifying information casino scrip liability account matching information etc. . In the case of an EGD delivering won undisclosed outcomes to a player the value balance associated with the undisclosed outcomes may be in the form of credits that must be played off the EGD and cannot be cashed out. Similarly the value balance may be delivered via a cashless instrument whose credits must be played versus cashed out. Alternatively the EGD can deliver the won undisclosed outcomes via a cashless instrument comprising various forms and or methods including those described within this disclosure.

The EGD of the present invention may be constructed from the ground up to include the necessary components connections programming etc. in order to function as described herein. Alternatively an existing EGD may be retrofitted such as with an Activity Monitor Unit AMU and related equipment to achieve the same level of functionality.

For example using a typical video slot machine such as those found in Nevada casinos an AMU can be connected to the EGD at various points between the EGD s main processor and the EGD s peripheral devices. In this case the peripheral devices include at least the display monitor all audio speakers and the cashless instrument generator. The AMU can also be connected via a network to a central processor and memory storage device. For example when a player makes a wager the AMU will command the video display to ask the player whether he wants to purchase an undisclosed outcome. If the player consents the AMU will release the EGD to generate an outcome. At the same time the AMU will block the outcome and the game play from being displayed on the video screen and audibilized etc. while substituting suitable creative content through the display and audio system etc. The AMU will also block the EGD from initiating payment and crediting of the EGD in the case of a winning combination. The AMU will then send the outcome display and audio data as well as credit balance EGD identification information etc. to the central processor via the network. The AMU will also allow credit information to be forwarded to the cashless system processor. However the AMU will intercept the cashless system s standard printer command. Thereafter the AMU will command the EGD s cashless printer to issue scrip with all normal data without prominently displaying the credit balance. Additionally the AMU will command the printer to include access codes identification data and outcome data for use with the later revelation of the undisplayed outcome. Upon returning to the casino for redemption the player merely inserts the ticket in the EGD s bill acceptor as he normally would and the credit value of ticket will be allotted to the EGD in a typical fashion.

With the programmability inherent in the AMU and the programmable sound card for electronic devices alternate creative content can be output during the process of generating and delivering an undisplayed outcome just as with the processor used to monitor EGD activity and generate commands.

It is to be understood that the processor or AMU can command all peripheral devices it shares with an electronic gaming device EGD peripheral devices for which it is the sole command device peripheral devices it shares with other equipment and or systems etc. An example of commanding EGD peripherals is when the processor upon occurrence of an event or series of events commands the EGD video display system and audio system to output bonus related animation and corresponding audio for a player. The player would then engage player controls if necessary and make selections. Thereafter the processor would command the EGD s video and audio systems to present the bonus outcome with corresponding video and audio outputs such as an animated lottery drawing etc. The bonus outcome itself can be pre selected and stored in memory or it can be generated by programming in the processor itself or generated by a connected peripheral device programmed or otherwise able to generate and or deliver a bonus outcome to the processor e.g. a random number generator RNG an EGD RNG pre selected table drawing etc. Thereafter the processor may command a printer cashless system player tracking system dispensing device payment device data based award delivery device or other device to generate and or deliver an award to the player if the previously generated pre selected bonus outcome entitled the player to such award.

Throughout this process the EGD s non bonusing activities and or outputs will be interrupted or reordered to allow the bonusing routines to finish prior to resuming normal activities and or inputs and or outputs. This may occur by pausing the circuit board s normal programming routines interrupting the circuit board s communications with the EGD s various component parts and delaying their command execution or it can similarly be accomplished by simply adding the bonusing routine elements to the EGD processing queue in the appropriate order and allowing the EGD processor or the processor to execute the bonusing routines independent of the game outcome processing using programming and or circuitry tools and or configurations including logic gates application programming interfaces APIs HKEYs hashing etc. to maintain a level of separation if desirable between an EGD s critical functions and other functions such as bonusing peripheral device functions etc.

In one example the video files audio files executable programming bonus outcome generation programming files etc. are stored in memory separate from that of the EGD s game logic circuitry and or programming. The memory storage device may be proximate to or contained by the processor or it may be available via a network connection. Such configurations separate creative content from the EGD s game logic circuitry and or programming and are employed so that the creative content and or its programming can be modified and or updated either directly or via a network connection without impacting or otherwise affecting the more sensitive game logic circuitry and or programming.

It is to be understood that all creative content and or peripheral programming for an EGD can be handled in a similar fashion that is separated from the EGD s critical components and or programming. This arrangement need not be limited to creative content and peripheral programming etc. used with bonusing. It would also be beneficial to maintain such a separation to more easily and efficiently modify all levels of creative content and or peripheral programming whether or not modifying the game outcome programming etc.

It should also be understood that it is the function of the programmable activity detector and command generator AMU and or the processor that is are relevant to the present invention and not its their precise construction location etc. In fact so long as the AMU and or the processor function s as described including not interfering with the EGD s game outcome determination the function s of the AMU and or the processor may be carried out by any device or software construct within an EGD or EGD system with or without unidirectional information transfer.

Using a separate device like an AMU offers numerous benefits. One of these benefits is the ability to use the AMU as a universal controller for all of the peripheral devices employed by an EGD. As mentioned this separation of the critical outcome determination logic from most if not all of the remaining functions of the gambling device makes for easier updating of non critical functions and can expedite regulatory review processes.

Embodiments of the present invention include use in gaming devices and gambling games such as a slot machine video poker keno video 21 or Blackjack a video lottery terminal VLT a video lottery system a game that is controlled by a central determinant system any other video game a playing card game a card shuffler or a table game.

Other embodiments of the present invention include a bonusing system that generates a bonus without impacting the generation of the gambling device game outcomes but that is responsive to events that occur within the gambling device. The bonus system could be integrated into the gambling device or a detachable module that could be included as an add on modification to an existing game.

Notification of an award or bonus could occur via video audio or other peripherals of the gambling device. A video notification of an award could manifest itself as any simulated or actual outcome for example a lottery drawing graphically displayed on the EGD monitor or another display. The bonus could be awarded as pre printed materials such as a coupon scratch off ticket etc. The pre printed materials are typically awarded by a dispensing device. Tangible prizes can also be delivered by a dispensing device. Alternatively the bonus could be awarded by a printer that prints bonus materials such as a lottery entry lottery award credits redeemable by an EGD etc.

It should be understood that a wide variety of embodiments are covered with various combinations of the elements of the present invention. While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of embodiments those skilled in the art having benefit of this disclosure will appreciate that other embodiments can be devised through various combinations of elements of the invention which do not depart from the scope of the invention as disclosed here. Accordingly the scope of the invention should be limited only by the attached claims.
