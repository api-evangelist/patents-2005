This invention was made under U.S. Government Contract N00019 02 C 3003. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

This invention relates to an improved structural joint that is especially useful for joining components made of composite materials. The joint is described in the context of a turbine engine inlet case or similar duct.

Turbine engines such as those used to power aircraft may include an inlet case for guiding a stream of working medium fluid into the engine. The case includes radially inner and outer walls both circumscribing an engine axis to define an annular gaspath. Struts span radially across the gaspath to connect the walls to each other. The interface between each strut and the adjoining wall and substructure must have the capacity to withstand appreciable structural loads.

Some engines employ a multifunctional strut whose surface is aerodynamically contoured so that the strut satisfies both structural and aerodynamic requirements. Alternatively a designer may find it necessary or desirable to employ a dedicated structural strut enveloped by an aerodynamically contoured shell that has little structural value. If the designer is also required to package the dedicated structural strut and its shell in the same volume of space that would have been occupied by the multifunctional strut the structural strut will be smaller than the multifunctional strut. This can compromise the strength of the interface or joint between the strut and the wall and substructure particularly when the case is made of preforms comprising plies of composite materials.

In one embodiment of the joint an outer preform includes legs extending longitudinally and laterally from a fold. An inner preform projects longitudinally past the fold to define a spar. The spar includes a wing angularly offset from the spar. The spar and wing cooperate with a substructure to resist separation of spar and wing from the substructure.

The foregoing and other noteworthy features of the joint will become more apparent from the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.

The inlet case includes a radially inner wall and a radially outer wall not shown both circumscribing an engine axis . The walls define the radially inner and outer extremities of an annular flowpath for guiding a stream of working medium fluid F axially into the engine. A set of circumferentially laterally distributed struts span radially longitudinally across the flowpath.

The inlet case which includes the walls and struts is made of laminate preforms comprising one or more layers or plies of a composite material. An example composite material is a graphite fabric embedded in a cured resin.

As seen best in the strut includes laterally inner preforms laterally outer preforms and optional intermediate preforms residing laterally between the inner and outer preforms.

Each outer preform has legs extending longitudinally and laterally respectively from a fold in the outer preform. The fold extends substantially axially because the strut is oriented approximately parallel to axis . However the strut and or fold may be oriented obliquely relative to the axis. The inner preforms and the optional intermediate preforms project longitudinally past the fold to define a spar . The projecting portions of the inner preforms are axially oversized relative to the finished axial dimension S of the spar. During fabrication forward creases are formed so that the oversized portion defines forward wings that extend from the spar in laterally opposite directions. In the illustrated embodiment aft creases are also formed to define aft wings that extend from the spar in laterally opposite directions. The wings are angularly offset from the spar by an angle of about ninety degrees.

The portions of the optional intermediate preforms that project longitudinally past the lateral legs could also be creased to define additional wings. However in the illustrated construction the projecting portions of the intermediate preforms are devoid of any wings.

As seen in The fibers comprising the inner preforms are off angle fibers oriented obliquely i.e. neither parallel nor perpendicular to the creases . Preferably the fibers are oriented at 45 degrees relative to the crease to ensure optimum strength.

Referring now to B and C the forward wings extend laterally toward a companion wing associated with a neighboring strut. As seen in the wings need not reach across the entire lateral or circumferential distance between the struts. The wings may abut each other as seen in or may overlap each other as seen in . These options are also applicable to the aft wings .

Referring again to and a cover preform covers each laterally extending leg of the strut outer preforms . The cover preform extends from each strut to its circumferentially adjacent neighboring struts.

The inlet case also includes a substructure whose components include a circumferentially continuous prefabricated composite forward ring a circumferentially continuous prefabricated composite aft ring and a set of discrete circumferentially distributed prefabricated composite inserts all of which are described in more detail in the succeeding paragraphs.

The forward ring borders the forward face of the forward wings . The inserts border the opposite face of each forward wing so that each wing nests between the ring and an insert . Each insert extends circumferentially from a spar to a circumferentially neighboring spar. The cover preform wraps over forward face of the forward ring .

As seen best in the aft ring includes a base portion and an axial extension . The base borders the aft face of aft wings . The extension extends axially aft of the base and cooperates with the cover preform and the lateral legs of the outer preforms to define an aft portion of wall . The inserts border the forward face of the aft wings so that each wing nests between an insert and the aft ring . The inserts occupy the space between the forward wings and their counterpart aft wings .

During fabrication of the inlet case the various composite preforms and prefabricated components of the substructure are arranged as described and thermally processed so that the preforms bond together at their interfaces with each other and also bond to the prefabricated substructure components.

With the components of the inlet case having now been described the overall construction may be better appreciated. The outer preforms spar and wings interface with the substructure to form a joint of superior strength. The joint resists any tendency of the strut to separate from the substructure and or wall due to operational forces. The structural superiority arises in part from the wings. This is because the area of contact between the wings and the substructure augments the contact area between the spar and the substructure. As a result the ability of the spar wing combination to withstand shearing forces is greater than that of the spar alone. The structural superiority also arises from the cover layer which helps resist any tendency of the lateral legs of outer preforms to peel off the insert . This is a noteworthy feature in applications where the strut is axially foreshortened resulting in less surface area and therefore less intrinsic peel resistance between the lateral legs and the inserts. The wings also contribute to the structural superiority of the joint especially when tensile loads attempt to pull the strut radially away from the wall . Because the wings are mechanically retained by the cover layer the fibers in the wings must be mechanically fractured in order for the strut to pull out of the radially inner wall . Since the tensile strength of the composite fibers can be considerably greater than the shear strength of the bond between the preforms the strength of the joint is improved by the presence of the wings. The improved shear resistance peel resistance and mechanical retention are especially useful in applications where a designer finds it necessary or desirable to employ a relatively small structural strut.

Although this invention has been shown and described with reference to a specific embodiment thereof it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made without departing from the invention as set forth in the accompanying claims. For example the preform arrangement may be augmented with additional preforms and the substructure may take other forms depending on the application of interest. And although the invention has been described in the context of an annular fan inlet case for a turbine engine it is clear that the construction can be used in other types of ducts and in other applications not necessarily involving ducts.
