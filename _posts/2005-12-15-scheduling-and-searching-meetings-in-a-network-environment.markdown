The present invention relates to a method system and program for scheduling and searching meetings in a network environment.

When scheduling a meeting with a group of users the organizer of the meeting may send an email to invitees or potential participants. The invitees may then respond via a reply email indicating whether or not they will attend the meeting. The email to the invitees may include controls to allow the invitee to indicate whether they will accept decline etc. The organizer may keep track of the attendees through the email program.

Notwithstanding there is a need in the art for improved techniques to organize meetings over a network and to enable users in the network to access information about scheduled meetings

Provided are a method system and program for scheduling and searching meetings in a network environment. A form is transmitted over a network to be rendered at an organizer computer to enable entry of information on a meeting. The form is received having organizer entered information on one meeting. The information in the received form is stored in a meeting database wherein the stored information from the received form is associated with the meeting identified in the received form. A user computer accessed by a user is enabled to register for at least one selected meeting. An email database accessed by the user is updated automatically to include information on the at least one selected meeting indicated.

In a further embodiment an electronic form indicating at least one meeting in the meeting database is transmitted to the user computer wherein the electronic form includes a displayed register button that when selected by the user at the user computer automatically registers the user of the user computer with the at least one selected meeting in the meeting database and updates the email database for the user with information on the at least one selected meeting.

In a further embodiment a single click selection of the register button at the user computer automatically registers the user with the meeting in the meeting database and automatically updates the user email database to have information on the at least one selected meeting.

In a further embodiment the user is indicated as an attendee of the at least one selected meeting in response to the user computer registering for the at least one selected meeting.

In a further embodiment the information for the meeting includes message addresses of invitees to the meeting. The user at the user computer is enabled to invoke a search for meetings in the meeting database. Search results identifying meetings for which the user is not one of the invitees of the meeting indicated in the meeting database is transmitted to the user computer. The at least one selected meeting comprises one or more meetings indicated in the search results.

In a further embodiment a page of information on the meetings added to the meeting database accessible at a network address is generated. The search results identifying meetings and links to the network addresses of the generated pages for the meetings identified in the search results are transmitted to one of the users to enable the user to access the page of information from the search results.

In a further embodiment enabling the user to search for meetings and register for at least one of the meetings indicated in the search results further comprises transmitting a search form to the user computer over the network. The search form enables the user computer to enter a search request to search meetings stored in the meeting database. The transmitted search results satisfy the search request. A registration request is received from the user computer with respect to at least one of the meetings identified in the search results wherein the user is added as an invitee to the at least one meeting indicated in the registration request.

In a further embodiment a message address of the user is added to the meeting database as one invitee for the meeting identified in the received registration request. An electronic invitation message is transmitted to the message address of the user providing information enabling the user to transmit information to add the user as an attendee of the meeting.

In a further embodiment the information for the meetings includes information on message addresses of the invitees. An electronic invitation message is transmitted to the message addresses of the invitees providing information enabling the invitees to transmit information to update the meeting database indicating the invitee as an attendee of the meeting.

In a further embodiment the transmitted electronic message enables the user to update an electronic calendar at the user computer with schedule information for the meeting for which the user is one of the attendees.

In a further embodiment the form enables the organizer to enter a network address of a broadcast of the meeting over the network which the user computer is capable of receiving during the scheduled time of the meeting or a telephone number of the meeting.

In a further embodiment the information for the meeting includes message addresses of invitees to the meeting. A form is transmitted to the message address of one of the invitees to enable the invitee to remove themselves as an attendee or invitee of the meeting in the meeting database.

In a further embodiment a page of information on the meetings added to the meeting database accessible at a network address is generated. The page of information includes information to enable the user to access the meeting at the user computer.

In a further embodiment the information for the meeting includes message addresses of invitees to the meeting. A form is transmitted to the organizer computer to enable the organizer to update information in the meeting database for the meeting. Electronic messages are generated and transmitted to the message addresses of the invitees for the meeting indicating the updated information in the meeting database for the meeting.

Certain of the components shown in the meeting server such as the meeting database and forms and may be stored in a storage device to which the meeting server is connected and loaded into a memory not shown of the meeting server for access by the meeting manager .

The computers . . . may comprise computing devices known in the art such as a server mainframe workstation personal computer hand held computer laptop telephony device network appliance etc. The meeting server may comprise a server class machine capable to process and service meeting related requests from multiple computers . . . . The network may comprise a Storage Area Network SAN Local Area Network LAN Intranet the Internet Wide Area Network WAN a wireless network peer to peer network etc. The meeting database may comprise a relational or other type of database system. The meeting database and other information used by the meeting manager may be stored in a storage system separate from the meeting server .

A meeting may comprise a scheduled event such as a technical presentation training session corporate meeting or presentation personal meeting etc. In certain embodiments the meeting is an event for which materials are to be presented and that may be recorded such that through the meeting server users may access the soft copies of the presentation materials as well as a recording that may be downloaded over the network such as a video or audio file recording of the presentation.

The forms and pages the meeting manager transmits to the user or organizer computers . . . to render in the user interface . . . may comprise a structured document page such as encoded in a hypertext markup language HTML Extended Markup Language XML etc. The meeting server and computers . . . may use a file transfer protocol such as the Hypertext Transport Protocol HTTP or other suitable file transfer protocols known in the art to transfer electronic pages and entry forms.

The meeting manager may transmit at block an electronic invitation message to the message addresses of the invitees providing information enabling the invitees to transmit information to the meeting server to register as an attendee and record the registered user as an attendee in the meeting database information . The electronic invitation message may comprise an email sent to the email message address for the attendee that includes a graphical control such as a hypertext link that when selected transmits a message to the meeting server to add the invitee as an attendee to the attendees information . In further embodiments the message sent to the invitees may include a function to update an electronic calendar of the invitee to include a scheduled event for the meeting. The meeting manager may further generate at block a meeting page of information on the meeting added to the database accessible at a network address URL . The URL of the meeting page is also added as field to the meeting database information .

In certain embodiments the user may obtain search results including meetings in which the user doing the search is not an invitee and in which the user is an indicated invitee. For those meetings indicated in the search results for which the user was not designated as an invitee by the organizer the user may select to be added as an invitee to the meeting.

In certain embodiments the user may perform from a received search results form the operations of adding themselves as attendees of one or more meetings and having their electronic calendar s updated with information on meetings for which they have registered through the search results form in the manner described below. Thus by selecting the register button users may perform in a single click or multiple clicks the operations of adding themselves as an attendee and having their calendar updated with information on the event for which they registered without having to perform any additional intervening operations.

In further embodiments the meeting manager may transmit an electronic form to the message address of one of the invitees to enable attendees to remove themselves as an attendee for the meeting in the database .

In still further embodiments the meeting manager may transmit a form to the organizer computer . . . to enable the organizer to update information in the database for the meeting such as the information . After the information for the meeting in the meeting database is updated the meeting manager may generate and transmit electronic messages to the message addresses of the invitees and or attendees for the meeting indicating the updated information.

The email database may comprise the email database updated with information on a meeting in the meeting database in response to a registration request according to the operations described in such as in response to a registration request initiated by selection of the register button in .

In one embodiment the meeting and email databases may be implemented with different database technologies such as databases from different vendors. Further the meeting server and email server may be implemented in different application environments. For instance the meeting server may be implemented in application programming interfaces APIs developed and implementing using the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition J2EE programming model and platform C C or other suitable application programming languages. The email server may be implemented in APIs in another application model such as a Java or other syntax specific to the email server environment which may differ from the programming model used to implement the meeting server . The email server may comprise an integrated email and calendaring program such as Lotus Notes Microsoft Exchange etc. Microsoft is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation and Lotus Notes is a registered trademark of International Business Machines Corp. . The email server may also be capable of handling electronic messages in different formats such as including a messenger server component to handle instant messages. In one embodiment the meeting server APIs cannot directly interact with the email database to provide meeting information from the meeting database to store in the email database . In such case the meeting server must call email server APIs to provide meeting information to the email database . In certain embodiments the meeting server may call the email server APIs to directly provide meeting information to store as meeting information in the email database and to user calendars in the email database . In an alternative embodiment the meeting and email database may be implemented using a same database product or within the same database but in different tables in the database.

In an embodiment where the meeting system and email system are operating in a same host or runtime environment then the meeting server may invoke the email server APIs by direct system calls. In additional embodiments where the meeting server and email server execute on different hosts or within different runtime environments in the same host then the meeting server may use a remote procedure call to invoke the email server APIs such as a Java Remote Method Invocation RMI .

The called email server API calls database commands to store at block the provided information on the meeting in the email database using an identifier of the meeting in the email database . For instance the called email server API may create a new entry in the email database having an identifier to store the provided meeting information. The email server further adds at block to the meeting ID map an association of the identifier in the meetings database and the identifier in the email database of the new meeting. As discussed the meeting information includes information on the invitees . The email server may further transmit at block a message to the user accounts of the invitees of the meeting. Thus the call from the meeting server invokes a series of operations by the email server to update the email database and provide a message to invitees notifying them of the meeting. In an alternative embodiment the meeting server may send emails to the invitees notifying them of the event. In one embodiment the meeting server through the email server API calls may transmit information on meetings directly to the email of user accounts without having to transmit the information in a message over a network through which emails are normally transmitted. In an additional embodiment the meeting server and email server may communicate over an internal network.

In response to receiving at block invocation from one of the invitees that received the message to schedule the meeting i.e. add the invitee as an attendee the email server updates at block the calendar for the invitee generating the invocation to indicate the meeting as scheduled. In one embodiment the message sent to the user account of the invitees may comprise an email message or an event message stored in an event inbox of the user account . Further in the embodiment of the email server provides the message notifying the invitee of the meeting without requiring additional calls by the meeting server to send the notification message.

The notification message may include a user selectable command such as a graphical button that invokes the email server to add information on the meeting to the invitee s calendar as a scheduled or accepted event. Upon invoking the email server from the message the user may be added as an attendee to the meeting information for the meeting. The meeting server may be notified by the email server when the user becomes an attendee so the meeting database may update the attendees information for the meeting to indicate the invoking invitee as an attendee.

In an additional embodiment the meeting server may call the email server to update a user s calendar at block with information on one or meetings for which the user registers through a search results form by selecting the register button . Thus the meeting server may perform the operation at block in by calling an email server API to cause the email server to add information on a selected one or more registered meetings which may have been registered through the search results form to the user s calendar

In response to the call the email server determines at block from the associations in the meeting ID map the identifier in the email database associated with the received identifier of the updated message in the meetings database . The email server uses at block the determined identifier in the email database to update the information in the email database for the identified meeting with the received update. The email server uses at block the determined identifier in the email database to determine users having the updated meeting scheduled in their calendar which may comprise those users indicated as attendees in the attendees information for the updated meeting in the email database . The attendees information in the email database may be accessed using the determined identifier for the updated meeting in the email database .

The email server transmits at block a message to the determined users i.e. the users whose calendars are scheduled with the updated meeting providing notification of the update to the meeting information. In one embodiment the email server may receive at block indication that the update notification message was opened read by a user. In response to receiving this indication that the notification message was opened the email server may in response automatically update at block the calendar of the user indicated as opening the update notification with the update information on the meeting. For instance the email server may update the meeting information in the scheduled meeting page in the calendar . In an alternative embodiment the email server may automatically update the calendar with the updated meeting information of attendee users without waiting for acknowledgment that the user attendee opened the notification message. In such case the notification indicates updates to the calendar that have already occurred.

Described embodiments provide techniques for a meeting server to provide information on a meeting to an email server to provide to invitees of the meeting and store in an email database and in the calendar of invitees selecting to accept the scheduled meeting.
