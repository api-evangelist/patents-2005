This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 521 535 filed on May 17 2004 and entitled COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND METHOD FOR MANAGING INTERNAL OFFICE KNOWLEDGE the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

A computer program listing appendix is submitted herewith on compact disc recordable CD R as Appendix A. Duplicate copies of Appendix A are provided as Copy 1 and Copy 2. The materials on the CD R are identical to each other.

The present invention generally relates to the fields of electronic information management and retrieval and in particular embodiments is especially useful for management of internal information records such as those internal informational records relevant to the operation of a business or personal to an individual.

Computers are found and used in practically every aspect of society. Many factors have driven the growth of computers and in particular personal computers. For example advancements in hardware capability and usage as well as the increasing usefulness of the Internet have greatly contributed to the popularity and widespread use of personal computers. Today computers are instrumental tools in many applications and areas including for example personal finance entertainment education communication business and personal interest. Specific activities that computers are used for include paying of bills shopping viewing of television or movies reading of magazines and newspapers and conversing with others such as via e mail or in an on line forum. All of these activities can be performed from the convenience of home or a work desk using a personal computer.

Among the advancements in hardware capability that have fueled the growth of computer usage is the ability to store large amounts of data on storage media such as disc drives e.g. CD DVD hard disc drives ZIP drives and servers. These and other storage media and their ability to store records data and other information provide a strong inducement for businesses and consumers to integrate computers into their lives. For example the ability of users to convert and store hardcopy documents such as letters bills papers proposals manuals etc. in electronic format on compact electronic storage media greatly reduces the physical space required for retaining paper records or hard copies .

Another benefit to storing data and other information on electronic storage media is accessibility. Storage media such as compact discs and the like are easily transportable for example between work and home between different businesses and on business trips. Networks may also be established for permitting multiple users to share data and records. Other tools such as email and the Internet provide still further means for accessing and sharing information.

Despite all of the above described advantages the storage of large amounts of data files documents and other records in electronic format can create organizational and retrieval problems. As a society perhaps never has more information been available than it is now. But the storage and availability of this information is negated if computer users even unsophisticated computer users cannot locate and retrieve the information in an efficient manner.

Information organizational and retrieval problems can become especially prevalent in business environments. For example storing records electronically on CDs floppy discs hard drives and other storage media not connected to a network can isolate other users from the records and hence valuable information. Logic trees are used for data organization but generally are difficult to understand and lack meaningful directory and sub directory labels. The inability of a business to efficiently share its information among employees can lead to inefficiencies and waste. Time and resources are often squandered trying to locate existing information that is not easily accessible or properly stored. Records that are not found or properly stored for retrieval are often assumed missing or non existent thereby causing an employee to recreate or recompile the information contained in the record from scratch. Further in the event that the business lacks a protocol or system for updating and retrieving information superseded documents may be unknowingly accessed and used. These problems can lead to immeasurable disorder and loss of employee time and company resources.

Another area in which storage sharing and retrieval of business information is important relates to employee knowledge and know how. A departing or absent employee often is the sole person at a business who possesses knowledge of certain business practices know how or other information. Departure of the employee can leave a large information void that if not otherwise prepared for can be difficult or impossible to recover. Many businesses deal with this problem in one of two ways 1 keep knowledgeable yet non productive employees on the payroll or 2 accept the loss of the employee as a cost of doing business and absorb the resulting informational loss and the financial cost of training a new employee. Small businesses having few employees are especially vulnerable to this particular problem. For example in a business having four employees loss of a single employee may constitute an about 25 loss of corporate memory.

Another potential problem area for information storage sharing and retrieval relates to Internet usage. Internet access and familiarity have become necessities in business. Many businesses rely on the Internet for conducting substantial portions of their business whether through on line purchases or sales advertising or client correspondence. Although it has become easier to conduct business via the Internet Internet usage can lead to problems. A single business may interact with multiple websites each of which may be associated with a different user name and password. User names and passwords not properly accessible amongst employees can impede business Internet activities and can cause security problems. Further re locating an important or relevant website can be difficult if the website address is not properly recorded for future reference.

Small and large business organizations churches and other entities as well as individuals routinely rely on vast amounts of information to conduct day to day operations. Such information may be found in or constituted by documents manuals procedures contracts spreadsheets data passwords websites etc. Failure to properly manage and efficient retrieve this information can impart great inefficiencies to one s business or personal affairs. Accordingly there is a need for a computer program a system and related methods for efficiently managing information permitting authorized individuals to access information while optionally providing security measures against the release of the information to unauthorized individuals and allowing updates and retrieval of information without significantly disrupting the flow of normal business practice.

To achieve one or more of the foregoing objects and in accordance with the purposes of the invention as embodied and broadly described herein according to a first aspect of this invention there is provided a record management and retrieval method. According to the method in response to a user search query comprising a query search term a private search space comprising a plurality of electronically recallable internal information records is electronically searched each internal information record of the plurality of electronically recallable internal information records having a keyword field for receiving an associated keyword. From the electronic search of the private search space an internal information record whose associated keyword in the keyword field matches the query search term is identified and presented to the user.

A second aspect of the invention provides a computer usable medium for managing and retrieving internal information records. The computer usable medium comprising computer readable program code means for causing a computer to display a plurality of electronically recallable internal information records of a private search space to a user via a display unit each internal information record of the plurality of electronically recallable internal information records having an associated keyword field for receiving a keyword. The computer usable medium further comprises computer readable program code means for receiving a user search query comprising a query search term. The computer usable medium further comprises computer readable program code means for identifying from the private search space an internal information record whose associated keyword in the keyword field matches the query search term and computer readable program code means for displaying the identified internal information record to the user.

According to a third aspect of the invention a system for managing and retrieving internal information records is provided. The system comprises a computing device an input device for receiving a user search query comprising a query search term an output device and a private data storage comprising a plurality of electronically recallable internal information records. Each internal information record of the plurality of electronically recallable internal information records has an associated keyword field containing a keyword. The system further comprises a computer program loaded on the computing device for electronically searching the private data storage in response to the user search query identifying from the data storage an internal information record whose associated keyword in the keyword field matches the query search term and presenting identified internal information record on the output device to the user.

Referring to a user interface screen representing an embodiment of a computer program of the invention and suitable for carrying out embodied methods of the invention is shown. The user interface screen depicted in is the home or main screen. In the illustrated embodiments multiple internal information records or articles as referred to several of the figures hereinafter referred to as records in the interest of brevity of a search space e.g. database are listed in a grid or table format. It should be understood that while not shown other arrangements or formats of records are possible. The table includes the following field headings Topic Open Question Title Solution Date Sequence Views and Attachment.

The Topic field may be used to categorize the records such as according to subject matter that each record relates to. Although not apparent from the figures the color of the topics headings may be changed to readily identify topics that are grouped together by color e.g. a distinct color for each topic. Topics may be added and removed using the System pull down tab and selecting Topic Set up . shows the resulting dialog box for editing topics. To add a topic Add icon also referred herein as a button is selected bringing up dialog box shown in . Selection of Background icon permits colors to be assigned and edited.

Selection of the Open field for a given record opens the record for viewing and editing. Alternatively a record may be opened by double clicking on any field in the record or by selecting the field and clicking on open button .

The Question Title and Solution fields provide a quick reference and summary of each record. As evident from the headings names the Question Title is selected to describe the information in the record by an intuitive question or by subject matter. Likewise the Solution field is provided with a brief answer to the question or solution offered by the record. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention a record having a completed Question Title field but lacking information in the Solution field is highlighted e.g. in bold or a different color such as red or otherwise distinguished and or reported to the user. In instances in which multiple users are using the computer program this feature permits a user to disseminate a question to other users of the computer program. When the user enters the record without information in the Solution field the record will show up on other user s screens allowing the other users an opportunity to answer the question and to disseminate the Solution not only to the querying user but to all users of the computer program having access to the record. A listing or report of unanswered questions may be created by using the mouse to click icon . The File pull down tab at the top of the screen of includes an option for viewing notifications.

Returning to the Date field provides the month day year on which the record was made. The Sequence field provides a number representing the sequential order in which the records were created. The Views field represents the number of times the record has been viewed by users. Finally the Attachment field indicates whether a document or other attachment has been attached to the record. The records may be sorted by alphabetically by Topic or Solution or sequentially by date sequence or views by clicking on the topic heading with the mouse. For example selection of the Date heading will sort the records chronologically according to the order in which the records were created.

New records may be added to the database in several different ways. For example addition sign icon is selected using a mouse to bring up an empty record as shown in . Also the File pull down tab at the top of the screen of includes an option for adding new records. Once an empty new record is opened the various data fields may then be entered as discussed in greater detail below. Adjacent icons and cause a selected record to be deleted and printed respectively.

The computer program permits attachment of a document to a record. Attachments are especially useful for linking a record to relevant information contained in the document. Various types of attachments are permitted. For example to attach an existing electronic document to a record the path to the electronic document may be typed into Attachment field shown in . Alternatively paperclip icon next to Attachment field is clicked to bring up a folder and document listing from which a document may be selected for attachment. Linking the electronic document to the record negates the need to keep track of the location of the document on the computer hard drive using a tree structure. Editing a document recalled with a record is performed easily by clicking edit icon . Upon completing the edits the edited document will immediately become available to other users having access to the document. An existing paper or physical document may also be attached to a record by selection of scanner icon . As shown in a dialog box is opened that permits the user to select the scan format of the document e.g. in PDF JPG or TIF format. The use of PDF format is particularly useful for saving a single document containing multiple pages such as contracts photo albums correspondence manuals etc. It is within the scope of the invention to modify the computer program to accept other scanning formats. Scanning documents into electronic format substantially reduces paperwork and linking the electronic files to corresponding records facilitates document retrieval. Document attachment also may be accomplished by clicking icon which permits the creation of new documents from scratch using an available program e.g. in MicroSoft Word Excel PowerPoint Publisher etc. for attachment to the record.

Internet website addresses also may be attached or linked to a particular record. Linking of a web address may be accomplished by entering the web address into the website field shown in . Alternatively a website address may be linked to a record by typing the website address in the Solutions field of the open record. The website is then accessed by striking the control button on the keyboard while the website is highlighted. A message is sent to the operating system to activate the browser.

 Folders field and icons and located further down the open record user interface screen links a particular record to a file folder of the database e.g. a file folder found in a logic tree. All files in the particular file folder are thereby linked to the record. Pressing the file folder button instructs the operating system to open the folder and present its contents to the user.

Returning to a plurality of icons or buttons immediately below the keyword fields provide additional record management operations. Starting with the icons on the left side of the user interface screen of Save icon and Un do icon permit the record to be saved and edited respectively. Other editing operations are available using the Edit pull down tab at the top of the main screen. E mail icon shown in permits the user to send the record via e mail to a recipient preferably using an available program such as MS Outlook. Add Copy icon permits the user to create a new record identical to an existing record. The user is then permitted to edit fields of the new record as desired while retaining copied fields that are applicable to the new record. Creation of new records using the Add Copy icon facilitates record input by allowing repetitive field information to be copied between existing and newly created records.

To export a record a user clicks export icon to create an email having two attached files. The files may be saved to disc upon arrival at the destination. The user can later import the files from the main screen into their system. The user interface export screen is shown in . The sequence numbers are used to ensure that like files are not duplicated. For example if a record is exported from a business to a user s home as a home copy a new record or home record is created at the user s home. If the original record at the business is later edited and re exported to the user s home the computer software will update the superseded home record instead of re creating a separate new home record.

 Notes icon opens up a notebook page in which the user may enter notations thoughts and other information in a separate field linked to the record.

Entry of contact information for a record is accomplished by selection of Cntct icon which opens up contact information entry fields shown in . Contact information entry fields include normal contact information such as home and business addresses and phone numbers and email addresses. By compiling multiple records with contact information and assigning a common keyword e.g. rolodex contacts in a keyword field of each record the records saved in the computer program may serve as a searchable address book.

The Click to Notify icon appearing in the record screen permits a user to bring a specific record to the attention of the user or another user when the record has been modified deleted or requires review. As shown in the dialog box depicted in the user may check the On Modify box to automatically notify himself or herself and or another user or users when the record has been modified. The On Delete box is checked to notify the user and or another user or users when the particular record has been deleted. Finally the Review box is checked to bring the record to the attention of the user and or another user or users on a specific date entered in the Review Date box for review. The Click to Notify operation is especially useful for keeping a particular user or users apprised of edits to a record that is vital or otherwise significant to the user s .

To close the record and return the user from an individual record screen to the main screen the Return icon located and the upper right hand corner of the open record see is selected with the mouse.

Searching of the records database is performed by entering a search term or terms into keyword search field on the main screen and clicking Go icon or striking the return key on the keyboard. The computer program searches for keyword fields of records for keywords matching the search request in search field . In its current version the software permits searching of up to nine 9 search terms although it should be understood that software modifications may be made to permit searching of a fewer or greater number of search terms. For additional search options the user may select search icon which will bring up the search dialog box shown in . Once the search icon is selected the following four search technique options are made available to the user 1 Any of these words searches for records containing any one of multiple search terms entered into the keyword search field 2 All of these words searches for records containing each and every search term entered into the keyword search field 3 This phrase only searches for records containing a phrase identical to the phrase entered into the keyword search field and 4 Whole word s only searches for whole words in the record that match the search term s in the keyword field . Search options also permit narrowing of the search to specific record fields and in particular the keyword question solution and contact fields by clicking of buttons and respectively.

The embodied computer program and method include a security system. The security system is accessed via the User Setup file of the System pull down tab on the main screen. illustrate a dialog box of the security system. The dialog box of includes a user list containing all of the registered users for the database. To add a new user the system administrator clicks the Add icon and a new user name and password are entered into the appropriate fields as shown in . According to an embodiment the security system provides the system administrator with security restriction authority for granting or denying users permission to execute record management operations on the electronically recallable internal information records. Permissions may be granted for each user on either a record by record basis by controlling user access to individual records as described below. Record management operations include such activities as adding a new record viewing and editing an existing record attaching a document to a record modifying record permissions changing labels changing user settings allowing auto login explained in further detail below and other operations described herein. The modify record permissions essentially permits the system administrator to delegate authority to control permission usage. Upon selecting Add icon the system administrator is given the option of copying permissions from an existing user to the new user. The system administrator then either clicks on Save icon to save the new user and selected permissions or Undo icon to delete the new user prior to saving.

The security system is optionally provided with an auto login feature which is activated by clicking the Turn Passwords Off icon . When activated the auto login feature allows a user to log on to the computer program if the user name saved in the program matches the Windows user name logged into the work station. The auto login feature is deactivated by clicking the Turn Passwords On icon . According to an embodiment once the passwords system is turned on the computer program defaults to permitting each user access to all records.

The security system of the embodied computer program is capable of individually assigning different security setting to different records. This feature is activated by turning on the password function which is accessible via the User Setup file of the System pull down tab. See . When the password function is activated users possessing appropriate permissions will have security icon appear on the record screen as shown in . Clicking on security icon brings up security dialog box . The user can then check or uncheck access boxes next to each user name to respectively allow and deny access and record management operations to the record.

The logic flow of the computer program embodied above will now be explained with reference to through F. Upon opening the computer program the program performs a system check e.g. of folders memory files and data tables . The computer program then checks the current user from the Operating System and compares the user with the list of users in the record data table . If a match is found and if the record in the record data table has a .t. in the auto login field the computer program will automatically log the new user into the system. If the user is not found or if the auto login is not equal to .t. then the computer program presents the user with a login screen and asks for a user name and password.

The computer program then checks for internet connectivity . If connected the computer program checks to see if there are records to download . If there are records to download the computer program downloads the records and adds them to the records already contained in the CHANGES.dbf Data Table. See .

At flow chart boxes and the computer program checks for records to import and takes steps for importing the records. If the user imports the record KB import checks the record to see if it already exists. If the record exists the superseded is overwritten with new information. If the record does not exist it is added to the user s Changes.dbf.

Next at flow chart box the computer program looks for any notifications that will be listed in the UserAlerts.dbf file with the user s name and the record Key ID field. Based on this the notifications are placed in front of the user. The user can go to any record that is listed in the notification or the user can clear the notification so that the notification does not come up again . The computer program also looks for any records that have any empty Solution field and prompts the user for answers.

At and the computer program sets up and activates the main menu and tool bar for permitting the user to navigate through the system and perform searches. Main menu includes help menu and files menu edit menu and system menu . Help menu permits the user to go to provider website using Internet connection . Help menu also includes the following options general information connectivity test registration forms order form and reenter .

Edit menu permits the user to perform several editing functions including undo redo select all copy cut and paste. System menu includes a user set up function and screen which allows the user to add new users to the system assign certain rights and passwords and delete users. System menu further comprises a topic setup and topic setup screen which allows the user to add new topics to the system change topic colors and delete topics. System menu has a pack and reindex utility which reviews all records in the database and removes any records marked for deletion. The pack and reindex utility also creates indexes on the keywords topics creation date users and other fields that enable the system to work more efficiently.

From files menu the CHList.prg is called and activated to show all of the records to the user in a grid format . From the files menu the user can add a new record view notifications activate utility such as Dot Prompt a program that allows the user to enter commands directly into the database check for records in the provider s Master copy for downloading and import from any file having the same format as KBArticle.dbf. The Return function permits the user to go from a record back to the main file menu.

From the grid like listing of records the user is provided with several functions including double click which opens a particular record show all which removes all of the filters on the database except for the security filter and shows all records the user search unanswered which shows records lacking a solution in the Solution field delete for deleting a record from the CHANGES.dbf table and add new for adding a new blank article to the CHANGES.dbf table. Search function provides the user with a search dialog box in which search terms and phrases are entered and other search criteria selected. When the user clicks Search Now the records are filtered to include only those records satisfying the search criteria. Once that filter is established further filtering is performed to remove records that the particular user lacks permission to view. The filtered results are then represented to the user.

If a record is double clicked or otherwise opened the user is provided with the ability to edit the record and is presented with an edit form placing the program in edit mode . Available edit functions include notes button which allows the user to edit add and modify notes open buttons for opening attachments websites and folders security button for allowing the user to provide or deny management operations for a particular record notify button for bringing the user to the Notification form and allowing the user to check off the user s that should be notified if a record is edited or deleted add a copy button for creating a new record and then copying all information from the existing record to the new record and presenting the new record for editing delete button save and undo buttons for either writing information to CHANGES.dbf or discarding the changes e mail and export which cooperate with an email program and send emails return for returning the user to the change edit form scan button for allowing the user to scan a document in PDF or other form into the system and save the same in memory and print and print preview for sending a record to an attached printer .
