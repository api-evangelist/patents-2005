title: Location signposting and orientation
abstract: A signposting and orientation technology is presented. This technology employs signposts superimposed on map images in order to convey otherwise undisplayable information on a map image. With signposting, zoomed-in maps can convey relationships between items on the map image, even though some of those item are not directly displayed on the map images. For example, a signpost can convey the distance between an anchoring object of reference and an item that is some distance and direction away from the object. Any relationships between objects and/or items can be dynamically maintained even though both the objects and item are moving about a map image. Additionally, orientation marks can be used in conjunction with signposts to orient users of the technology. Orientation marks may employ directional vectors, beginning at with the object of reference and ending with the orientation mark, whether the mark is celestial in nature or otherwise.
