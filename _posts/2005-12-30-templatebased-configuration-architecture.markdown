Embodiments of this invention relate generally to installation and configuration of enterprise software and in particular but not exclusively relate to providing template based configuration structure in an enterprise environment.

Each AS instance may include one or more virtual machines VMs to interpret programs providing the presentation and business logic to service work requests . These VM machines may be JAVAVMs JVMs compliant with the JAVA 2 Platform Standard Edition J2SE etc. A VM is an example of a runtime system. A VM is an abstract machine that can include an instruction set a set of registers a stack a heap and a method area like a real machine or processor. A VM essentially acts as an interface between program code and the actual processor or hardware platform on which the program code is to be executed.

Web dispatcher implements a load balancing mechanism distributing work requests from client nodes among machines within cluster . Web dispatcher may be one of machines having the task of dispatching work requests among machines of cluster or a stand alone hardware node. Work requests are processed by machines and may subsequently be provided to database node . Database node offers up the requested data to machines which in turn process and format the results for display on client nodes . Each AS instance may further include its own dispatcher mechanism to distribute work requests assigned to it among its individual VMs .

Installation files for installing AS instances may be centrally stored within database . To deploy each AS instances installation files are copied from database node to each machine via a network link. Once copied installation files are installed generating a file system and establishing AS instances on each machine . When freshly installed each AS instance is deployed with a default configuration installation for VMs and the applications and services deployed therewith. AS instances may be operated using the default configuration installation however this does not guarantee that all available resources will be utilized optimally or that AS instances will function properly.

Typically once each AS instance is up and running with the default installation configuration a user manually configures each AS instance . Manual configuration generally requires a sophisticated knowledge about the hardware and OS platforms as well as the tasks to be performed by each AS instance . The user configuring a default installation configuration may need to determine and input a large number of parameters unique to each AS instance in a time consuming and error prone processes.

Furthermore the conventional configuration technique with the JAVA stack relies on system dependent information which is heavily and redundantly distributed across the entire cluster configuration tree. This for example makes it impossible to adjust the configuration when system settings e.g. JAVA home system name instance number host names etc. are changed. Also since system dependent settings are statically configured within the configuration database when the system environment changes e.g. due a system copy these settings are to be adapted manually which makes it impossible to move a configuration as is from one system to another. Further there is a high risk of inconsistent configuration of cluster nodes running on the same instance

A system and method are provided for template based configuration architecture. In one embodiment configuration information from a first level is inherited. Configuration templates are customized via the inherited configuration information based on usage at a second level. The customized configuration templates are applied to default instances at a third level. In one embodiment the first level includes a default configuration level the second level includes a configuration templates level and the third level includes a system configuration level.

The above attributes may be implemented using a computer program a method a system or apparatus or any combination of computer programs methods or systems. These and other details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and in the description below.

Configuration architecture depicts a general cluster configuration structure which is presented here in three levels . In one embodiment the three levels include deployed components and default configuration level level 1 configuration template level level 2 and system configuration level level 3 . Lower levels derive or inherit from higher levels and may overwrite settings. For examples from bottom up level 3 includes instance configuration level which inherits from level 2 which inherits from deployed components and default configuration . Level 1 generally and or deployed components specifically may be referred to as global area or global. Customer side modifications may be made at level 3 while the content delivered by the provider e.g. SAP AG may be kept separate from and independent of customer modifications.

In one embodiment default configuration level or level 1 may provide a system independent default configuration that is abstract and derived from standard instance via deployed default component configuration . This configuration information is inherited at basic instance where the information from level 1 is aggregated and further inherited at basic instance customized . Configuration information at basic instance customized may then be used to generate templates that are use or usage specific. Level 1 may also include component binaries that are inherited at component binaries at level 2 and aggregated at basic instance along with configuration information from component configuration . At basic instance a number of nodes the configuration of which may be abstract may also be assigned to basic instance .

Configuration template level or level 2 may include predefined instance configuration for specific use cases and scenarios such as portal KM minimal instance JAVA 2 Platform Enterprise Edition J2EE developer etc. For example at level 3 instances in communication with system include J2EE developer instances and portal KM instances that are provided via customized J2EE developer and customized portal KM respectively at customized layer further via templates J2EE and portal KM of templates at configuration template . Current instance may include a virtual instance that has a parameterized link to an instance running in a given system context e.g. containing the instance identification as parameter . During runtime configuration consumers access current instance that points to the right instance from instances during runtime. Stated differently at runtime current instance is assigned to a particular instance of instances that the component can access

In one embodiment level 2 contains a system independent configuration that is configured or provided via dynamic configuration that includes parameterized settings computed settings and or value links. This system independent configuration may be moved between different systems with ease. Further level 2 and its contents are derived from default configuration and overwrite the settings according to each of the specific usages to which templates are assigned. Also instances are homogenously configured which means all server nodes e.g. virtual machines of instances may share the one and the same configuration.

Level 2 contains several configurations such as instance layout configuration VM configuration kernel configuration service settings application configuration cluster file system configurations and runtime filter configuration etc. For example the instance layout may contain the configuration about the number of server nodes running on that particular instance. The instance layout may be configured via a simple numeric property which specifies the number of server nodes. This property is by default defined as an arithmetic expression dependent on the hardware available for the instance e.g. dependent on the number of processors and the amount of available memory . Thus the instance layout dynamically adapts itself to the environment on which the instance is running. In a high end environment an instance may include a higher number of server nodes where in a low end environment e.g. developer personal computer merely a single server node may be running on the instance.

Similarly a VM or JVM configuration may contain VM memory settings and parameters. These settings are specified in a system independent way via parameterized and computed configuration entries. The maximum heap size could for example be configured as an arithmetic expression dependent on the amount of physical memory and the number of server nodes running on a particular instance. These settings are dynamically adapted to a specific environment. A kernel configuration may contain system independent properties of the manager components of the engine. These settings are abstracted via parameterized and computed settings. Service settings may contain system independent service properties of each service component which is part of the installation. As with the VM and kernel configurations these settings are abstracted via parameterized and computed settings. An application configuration may contain system independent application configuration of each application which is part of the installation.

A cluster file system configuration may contain the system independent configuration of components that are deployed into the file system e.g. configuration tool visual administration etc. . The bootstrap process may be responsible for synchronizing this configuration along with components themselves to the file system. During synchronization a configuration manager may transparently substitute dynamic settings and thus in the file systems the settings may be static. A runtime filter configuration may contain the configuration to enable and disable components according to the use case scenario associated with templates . The installation may contain more components than those that are actually used in a specific use case and scenario. Those components that are not needed are disabled and those components that are needed are enabled via runtime filter configuration. For example in J2EE developer template the runtime filter configuration may disable every component except those components that are needed in a J2EE developer scenario.

In one embodiment configuration templates are derived from configuration basic instance which defines the basic structure of the instance configuration. Further this derivation may not be direct but instead another level basic instance customized may exist in between basic instance and configuration templates . Basic instance customized may belong to system configuration and is the place where system global configuration changes can be stored. While the deployment of templates occurs at level 2 the modification or customization of templates can be performed at level 3 via Application Programming Interfaces APIs and administrative tools. Minimal instance includes a template that is used during the instance installation and contains components that are needed to run the central configuration. A central configuration may be used to select and set the specific usage case template for instances to be configured.

In one embodiment a template configuration tool may be used to generate and configure templates and to provide functionalities for managing the general flow of the auto configuration process. For example the auto configuration process may activate an already existing template by assigning one or more of system instances to that template . Templates may include use or usage based templates that are system independent but they may include any combination of software platform dependent parameters hardware platform dependent parameters and or use case dependent parameters.

System configuration may contain an actual configuration such as a configuration of the actual instance belonging to a system. Each instance may be assigned a usage case scenario which is to be executed by the corresponding instance during runtime. Thus the instance configuration is derived from configuration templates associated with the corresponding use case and scenario. Further templates contain system dependencies dynamically e.g. via parameterized and computed settings so there is no need to overwrite these settings in the actual instance configuration. Various configurations may dynamically adapt themselves to an actual system environment. Therefore the engine runtime itself may not need any additional configuration so it is functional without overwriting any settings inherited from templates .

Some engine components e.g. configuring landscape connectivity etc. may however be configured at customizing layer associated with templates . For example when an instance for a specific configuration template is generated a customizing configuration for the template is created with system configuration . Further a customizing configuration is derived from an actual template while an instance configuration is derived from the customizing layer of a selected template . Any configuration changes at the level of customizing layer may be visible across instances that are associated with configuration templates . For example any configuration changes at the level of customized portal KM apply to all portal KM instances within the cluster.

In one embodiment when configuration changes in a single instance is needed such changes may be made to a particular instance at the instance level at system configuration . However in certain cases when changes in configuration settings are needed for the entire system such as system e.g. for all usages that are activated in system the changes may be made for all instances such as J2EE developer and portal KM instances in communication with system . In this case configuration changes may be made at the level of basic instance customized which are then inherited down to instances via templates and customizing layer . Also such configuration changes or settings may be visible globally as long as the settings are not locally overwritten. It is to be noted that for brevity and clarity merely the illustrated instances templates etc. are provided but many more and fewer instances templates and other components modules etc. may be employed. For example one or more of instances may be configured via the same configuration template.

In one embodiment installation provides an entire system database e.g. J2EE configuration and a complete file system environment which is needed. For example installation provides an instance installation that provides a file system environment for instances and prepares instances within the configuration database. For example the two based kinds of instance configuration may include 1 application instances and JMS instances that are optionally installed in case JMS services are separated from applications. When installing application instances a particular usage of the instance may not be defined at this point however the usage may be later defined during configuration . Thus during installation first minimal instance is configured as it contains all the necessary components needed to subsequently run central configuration . Minimal instance may be configured via an appropriate configuration template. Further the instance installation may be performed via a batch configuration tool provided by the engine to create the instance configuration in the database and assign it to minimal instance configuration template .

For installing JMS instances JMS instance configuration template may be used. JMS instance may be made available as part of the configuration database. During the installation of JMS instances the installation tool may use a batch configuration tool to create the instance configuration in the database and assign it to JMS instance configuration template .

Central configuration is performed via configuration tool that for example runs within the J2EE engine. Configuration tool may be used to manage the configuration of system landscapes via corresponding configuration templates . The management of configuration templates by configuration tool may not only merely include one or more of instances but also a landscape of several systems. For example J2EE configuration templates within the J2EE engine may also be configured based on usages. Configuration may be broader in scope than a typical J2EE configuration. For example configuration tool may help facilitate activation and or customization of templates . Various J2EE configuration templates may be made available in software delivery archive SDA that is deployed into the J2EE engine prior to installing and configuring J2EE instances. Configuration tool may use J2EE configuration templates during configuration by assigning each instance configuration to the appropriate J2EE configuration template. After the installation of templates configuration may also provide activation and or customization of templates .

As discussed previously during installation of application instances the usage of instances may not be known however during installation application instances are configured via minimal instance which may be sufficient to run central configuration . Subsequently during configuration application instances are to be configured for specific usages. During configuration a custom layer configuration e.g. the layer from which instance configurations are derived including custom application instance may be assigned to a configuration template e.g. portal KM according to a particular usage of the system . This custom configuration e.g. custom application instance may be derived from a selected configuration template e.g. portal KM while the instance configuration of application instances may be obtained from the custom configuration.

In one embodiment configuration templates provided within the 2EE engine are system independent e.g. obtained by configuring the system dependent settings via parameterized and arithmetic expressions and thus the settings are correct and do not need to be changed or reviewed during configuration . This is particularly necessary for certain settings modifications such as instance layouts VM configurations kernel configurations several system dependent application and service settings etc. The customizing of additional engine components e.g. configuring landscape connectivity etc. may still be performed. For example when certain settings are to be modified for all instances e.g. JMS instance thru JMS instance n of JMS instances using configuration tool configuration may involve modifying such settings by accessing custom configurations e.g. custom JMS etc. corresponding to those instances and making changes there. However when configuration settings of a particular instance e.g. JMS instance of JMS instances are to be changed such settings may be changed at the level of that particular instance such as by directly modifying configuration settings of a JMS instance .

Furthermore a J2EE configuration tool belonging to the J2EE engine core layer may be used for an offline configuration of the J2EE engine system. This configuration provides a configuration for instance layouts e.g. the number of nodes running on an instance VMs or JVMs according to VM types and platforms kernel e.g. manager properties service properties application properties e.g. sap.application.global.properties and runtime filters for activation and deactivation of components according to a particular usage etc. as described with reference to . Further a J2EE configuration tool may allow the modification of configuration at the following two levels 1 particular instance and 2 configuration template . For example when changing the configuration at the level of a particular instance e.g. instance of application instances the change is made merely to the specific instance. However when changing the configuration at the level of a configuration template e.g. JMS instance this configuration change may impact all those instances e.g. JMS instances that correspond to and are configured via that particular configuration template. The J2EE configuration tool may not provide the editing of configuration template but instead it may allow for the editing of custom templates for specific configuration templates . Using this technique customer settings are kept separated from the default settings provided by the provider e.g. SAP AG that are deployed into the system.

Configuration manager may include configuration resolver which further includes resolver handler parameter resolver value link resolver and expression calculator . Once the meta attributes from abstract configuration data are communicated to configuration manager based on these meta attributes e.g. parameterized link and or computed various resolvers are called for parameter resolver value link resolver and or expression calculator . Furthermore system context corresponds to the same configuration data e.g. due to system copy etc. and is communicated to configuration manager . A resolved configuration is then communicated to configuration consumer . System context defines system system name etc. having different areas of inputs in system context . Any relevant hardware information may be gathered automatically via an operating system. Although users may provide some installation settings e.g. system name instance name etc. during installation host names may be gathered from the operating system.

In one embodiment configuration manager allows the configuration to be dynamic and to adapt itself to a specific system environment. This is achieved by configuration manager by providing parameterized configuration entries and computed configuration entries. The dynamic configuration as provided by configuration manager permits the use of the parameterized settings rather than the static values. Stated differently configuration manager accesses a set of system parameters e.g. host names instance name number of processors available memory etc. which are defined during a startup time. Using configuration manager the configuration settings which depend on the system environment are not configured as static values but instead they reference those system parameters that are accessed by configuration manager . This is accomplished by configuration manager by providing various types of configuration settings such as parameterized settings value link settings computed settings and inherited settings.

The parameterized settings containing system parameters may be provided by configuration manager and are resolved via parameter resolver . These parameters may be transparently substituted during runtime. The parameterized settings may also be used for system dependent settings which can be resolved by a simple parameter substitution. Various computed settings include simple arithmetic expressions containing system parameters from a system profile provided within configuration manager . These computed settings are provided via expression calculator . During runtime the parameters are transparently substituted and the arithmetic expression is evaluated. The computed settings are used when a simple parameter substitution is not sufficient and the value needs to be calculated out of specific system parameters e.g. cache sizes heap size etc. . Settings containing a link to other settings e.g. value link are used when a setting is dependent on another setting which is stored elsewhere. During runtime the value link is transparently resolved and substituted. Value link settings are resolved via value link resolver . The settings containing value links may be combined with various features of computed values. Using these settings for example configuration manager allows J2EE engine components to adapt their configuration dynamically to the system environment in which they are running. The changing of the system environment which changes system parameters dynamically changes the configuration. Configuration manager and other components of abstract configuration architecture allow various components to define their configuration such that they are system independent.

Using the information inherited from the default configuration level also known as the global level various configuration templates are generated and or customized at the configuration template level at processing block . A template customization and or configuration tool may be used to customize configuration templates such as generate and or customize the configuration template. Examples of such templates include J2EE developer portal KM minimal instance etc. The information from these configuration templates is inherited at the customizing layer forming customized information at the system configuration level at processing block . For each active template the customizing system layer may contain a custom template which may by default be empty . For example a template J2EE developer at the templates layer may have a corresponding custom template J2EE developer at the system layer.

The customized information via customized developers is then used to configure default instances into new configured instances at the system configuration level at processing block . Stated differently customized configuration templates are applied to default instances to configure them into configured instances. Default instances may be configured via an instance configuration tool. Default and configured instances may include application server instances. Examples of instances include J2EE development instance portal KM instance etc. Further such instances are in communication with a system. At processing block a current instance which includes a virtual instance is provided to allow a parameterized link to a running instance of one of the instances. Also during runtime configuration consumers are provided access to the running instance via the current instance at processing block .

The illustrated embodiment of enterprise system includes one or more clients communicatively coupled to one or more application server AS instances which are in turn communicatively coupled to one or more database . User interface provides a GUI to enable users of clients to interact with databases e.g. submit queries input data etc. through AS instances .

AS instances may each include business components presentation components and integration components which together form subcomponents of an AS e.g. WebAS by SAP AG . Business components provide the business logic of AS instance enabling complex business processes to be implemented. In a J2EE environment business components may include one or more Enterprise JavaBean EJB containers each including one or more EJBs. EJBs are JAVA based software modules that contain the actual business logic while EJB container encapsulates the EJBs in a JAVA based runtime environment that provides a host of common interfaces and services to the EJBs

Presentation components describe the specific manner in which the results of business components are formatted for display on user interface . The results may be formatted with aid of a web container that supports both servlets and JavaServer Pages JSPs . The servlets provide server side processing to generate the GUI and the JSPs are extensions of the JAVA servlet technology for providing dynamic content within the GUI. For example in WebAS the servlets may include SAP Enterprise Portal which provides a uniform and personalized access to various different back end systems via a browser Web Dynpro which uses JSPs to provide a development and runtime environment for Web applications or other presentation logic.

Integration components enable access to business functionalities from external resources. This is done using various services connectors middleware communication protocols and support for general data exchange formats e.g. extensible markup language . For example integration components may contain support for the following services JAVA Database Connectivity JDBC API the JAVA Naming and Directory Interface JNDI JMS the JAVA Transaction Service JTS the JAVA Transaction API JTA the J2EE Connector Architecture JCA and the like.

A template configuration tool may provide configuration of templates corresponding to any or all of the components of enterprise system described above including the business presentation and integration components. Furthermore template configuration tool may be used to configure the underlying engines that operate these components. These underlying engines may be various types of JVMs such as the J2EE engine. In one embodiments template configuration tool may be used to configure applications within clients various components of database a dispatcher for distributing work requests between AS instances or an internal dispatcher within each AS instance a message server and the like.
