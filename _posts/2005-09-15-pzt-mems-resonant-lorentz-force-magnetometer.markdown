The embodiments of the invention described herein may be manufactured used and or licensed by or for the United States Government.

The embodiments of the invention generally relate to microelectromechanical systems MEMS devices and microelectronic devices and more particularly to Lorentz force magnetometer devices.

Conventional MEMS Lorentz force magnetometer designs such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 959 452 issued to Givens et al. on Sep. 28 1999 the complete disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference describe both optical and capacitive transduction schemes. This capacitive design has achieved a sensor resolution of approximately 1 T using a drive current of 1 mA and a Q factor of 20 000 such as suggested by Wickenden et. al An Extremely Sensitive MEMS Magnetometer for use as an Orientation Sensor on Projectiles Royal Aeronautical Society Conference Nanotechnology and Microengineering for Future Guided Weapons Nov. 11 1999 the complete disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference.

However producing miniaturized optical MEMS devices such as magnetometers generally appears to present substantial technical challenges including overcoming size weight and power consumption parameters as well as attaining acceptable sensor resolution standards. In addition the proposed piezoelectric devices appear to suffer from inappropriate design choices. Using the same electrode for driving the Lorentz force current and piezoelectrically sensing those Lorentz forces directly couples the drive and sense functions of the sensor which generally prevents the measurement of external magnetic fields. This may also severely limit the maximum drive currents of the device due to the limited cross sectional area and thermal electrical material properties of the chosen conductor platinum. Generally the limited drive current directly limits the sensitivity and resolution of such a device.

Accordingly there remains a need for a novel MEMS magnetometer device capable of mapping magnetic fields in various applications and which is further capable of achieving size weight power consumption and resolution parameters previously unattainable by the conventional designs.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures there are shown preferred embodiments of the invention.

The process for fabricating the PZT MEMS resonant Lorentz force magnetometer is generally depicted in with the completed magnetometer device shown in . Moreover multiple options exist for process specifics of most of the processing steps and the embodiments of the invention are not limited to one particular processing technique. As shown in the starting processing material is a silicon Si substrate wafer having an approximate thickness of 450 m. Next a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD of silicon dioxide SiO is performed over the silicon wafer thereby forming a SiObase layer . The thickness of the silicon dioxide base layer may vary between 0.5 m and 2 m in thickness depending on the choice for the overall dimensions of the resonator the thickness of the LF conductor and the thickness of the PZT. Then a titanium platinum Ti Pt bottom electrode is sputter deposited over the SiObase layer . The titanium layer is approximately 0.02 m and the platinum layer is approximately 0.08 m in thickness. Next sol gel lead zirconate titanate PZT is spin coated over the Ti Pt bottom electrode . The thickness of the PZT may vary from 0.5 m to 1 m in thickness again depending on the choice for the overall dimensions of the resonator the thickness of the LF conductor and the thickness of the base layer. While PZT is a preferred material other piezoelectric materials could also be used in accordance with the embodiments of the invention.

Next as depicted in a reactive ion etching RIE process of the SiObase layer occurs down to the silicon substrate wafer which helps define the subsequent resonator component of the magnetometer device and enable its ultimate release from the silicon substrate wafer . In a PECVD of a second SiOlayer occurs over the exposed portions of the PZT layer top electrode Si substrate wafer and the first SiOlayer . Next as shown in a RIE process occurs to remove the second SiOlayer except for a small portion forming a pair of thin isolation posts i.e. isolators . The isolation posts which comprise the second SiOlayer are shown in the encircled dotted portion AA in which is further illustrated with greater magnification in .

As shown in the isolation posts surround a narrow anchored portion of the PZT layer as well as an upper and side surface of a small portion of the top electrode near the piezoelectric bond pad portion of the magnetometer . The isolation posts form a passivated path for subsequent top electrode traces to be deposited thereon. Without the isolation posts the top and bottom electrodes respectively would cause an undesirable short circuit in the magnetometer . Accordingly this process allows the top electrode bond pads shown in to be deposited onto the second SiOlayer as opposed to the PZT itself which significantly reduces the parasitic capacitance of the top electrode bond pads thereby reducing sensor noise. Thereafter the PZT is removed from the bottom electrode bond pad portion via wet etching as depicted in . As shown in a highly electrical and thermally conductive material such as titanium copper TiCu or titanium gold TiAu is deposited and patterned to form the Lorentz force LF drive conductor component shown in isolation in of the magnetometer . The thickness of the conductive material depends on the exact dimensions of the resonator the thickness of the PZT layer and the thickness of the SiObase layer but is typically between 1 m and 2.5 m. The LF drive conductor component provides the path for the drive current loops around the perimeter of the magnetometer device . The completed magnetometer device is shown in upon formation through well known deposition and patterning techniques of 0.5 m of the TiAu top electrode bond pads formed over the bond pad portion traces and LF conductor bond pads . Finally a xenon difluoride XeF isotropic etching process occurs to remove exposed portions of the silicon substrate wafer .

If the conductive material is formed of TiCu then the process occurs as generally described above. However if the conductive material is formed of TiAu then the last two processing steps involving the formation of the LF drive conductor component and the top electrode bond pads may be combined because the same material TiAu is used for each respective formation. Generally TiCu has superior thermal and electrical properties. Typically TiCu generates approximately half of the heat that TiAu does. This enables a larger drive current to be supplied to the device thereby resulting in greater sensor performance.

The various interconnect components such as the top electrode bond pads traces and LF conductor bond pads are further illustrated in which are a magnified perspective view of the bond pad portion encircled dotted area BB shown in of the magnetometer device and an isolated perspective view of the interconnect components respectively. The MEMS resonator component of the magnetometer device is shown in the isolated view shown in which generally comprises the encircled dotted area CC of the magnetometer device shown in . The MEMS resonator component is released from the silicon substrate wafer not shown in by the performance of the above mentioned XeFisotropic etching process. Thus the MEMS resonator component can be thought of as a free torsional current loop. However other geometric configurations could also be used. For example a clamped cantilever array design could be used not shown as well as other configurations depending on the particular application of the magnetometer .

The piezoelectric sensor component of the magnetometer device of is shown in the isolated view of . The piezoelectric sensor component which comprises the TiPt bottom electrode PZT layer and Pt top electrode senses the deformation of the MEMS resonator component due to Lorentz forces. In the top electrode bonds pads are for the LF drive conductor component of and the LF conductor bonds pads are for the piezoelectric sensor component of . A cross sectional view of the encircled dotted area DD of the magnetometer device of is shown in where an air gap exists between the conductive material of the LF drive conductor component and the TiPt PZT Pt piezoelectric sensor component thereby creating electrical isolation between the LF drive conductor component and the TiPt PZT Pt piezoelectric sensor component . Each of the LF drive conductor component and the TiPt PZT Pt piezoelectric sensor component is mechanically coupled to the first SiOlayer . However because the first SiOlayer is insulative there remains electrical isolation between the LF drive conductor component and the TiPt PZT Pt piezoelectric sensor component . Without the electrical isolation the drive function of the sensor generation of the Lorentz forces would be directly coupled to the sense function of the sensor piezoelectric detection of the Lorentz forces . Piezoelectric materials can act as sensors generation of electrical charge due to mechanical stress and conversely as actuators generation of mechanical strain due to electrical field . Therefore without electrical isolation the drive signal would otherwise cause the TiPt PZT Pt piezoelectric sensor component to actuate and not sense.

An experimental analytical model was developed to facilitate the choice of design variables used in accordance with the embodiments of the invention. The analytical model can accommodate simple geometries such as cantilevers free free and clamped clamped beams. The model approximates many of the designs the torsional current loop designs in particular have resonant bending dominated modes that behave much like cantilevers. The following are the relevant variables employed in the following equations 

The goal is to derive an expression for the current sensitivity of the device with respect to a static magnetic field Eq. 1 due to the Lorentz force Eq. 2 . The piezoelectrically generated current generated can be expressed in terms of the angular deflection of the cantilevers free end due to the Lorentz force acting upon it Eq. 3 .

For a cantilever geometry the angular deflection of the free end of the beam at resonance is expressed in terms of the distributed load acting upon it and the mechanical quality factor Eq. 4 . Substituting Eq. 2 and Eq. 4 into Eq. 3 the piezoelectrically generated current due to a Lorentz force induced by a static magnetic field and an AC current at a mechanical resonance frequency of the cantilever beam is obtained Eq. 5 . Substituting the resonance frequency Eq. 6 into Eq. 5 dividing out the magnitude of the magnetic field and simplifying the continuous drive current sensitivity of the device Eq. 7 is obtained.

Ignoring heat transfer factors the maximum drive current can be expressed in terms of the maximum temperature the thermal material properties of the conductor the cross sectional area and the duration of the application of the current Eq. 8 . The minimum pulse duration can be represented by a safety factor divided by the resonant quality factor and the resonant frequency Eq. 9 . Substituting Eq. 8 and Eq. 9 into Eq. 7 and simplifying yields the expression for the pulsed drive current sensitivity of the device Eq. 10 .

The EIterm in the previous equations is the bending stiffness or flexural rigidity of the composite cantilever structure. The area moment of inertia I of a cross section of the beam with respect to the y axis of the composite beam is the summation of the sums of the moments of inertia of each layer and the product of each layer s cross sectional area and the square of the distance from the neutral axis to the centroidal axis of each layer as given by the parallel axis theorem. The composite modulus of elasticity E is the summation of the products of volume fractions of each layer and the modulus of the corresponding layer. For a constant width beam the composite bending stiffness is Eq. 11 . The h term in the previous equations is the distance between the center of the piezoelectric layer and the overall structure s neutral plane. The location of the neutral axis is found by dividing the summation of the products of the layer cross sectional areas and the distances from the centroids of the layers to some arbitrary reference axis by the cross sectional area of the entire beam and the expression for h is given by Eq. 12 . The term his measured relative to the same arbitrary reference axis used to define the location of the neutral axis.

The design provided by the embodiments of the invention mechanically couples the LF drive conductor component drive function and the piezoelectric sensor component sense function by means of attaching both components LF drive conductor component and piezoelectric sensor component to a separate structure i.e. the silicon dioxide base layer . Furthermore the design provided by the embodiments of the invention electrically decouples LF drive conductor component drive function and the piezoelectric sensor component sense function by means of physically separating the LF drive conductor from the piezoelectric sensor component using isolators .

In an alternative embodiment a DC current may be applied to the LF drive conductor component . However if an AC current is used as described above then the resonator quality factor Q amplifies the device sensitivity by as much as 10 000. The magnetic fields that can be sensed at a high Q resonant mode is approximately Q times smaller than at static conditions i.e. DC drive . This means that the sensor is far superior at operating with a high Q as opposed to a low Q.

The embodiments of the invention provides a PZT MEMS resonant Lorentz force magnetometer that avoids conventional design flaws and functions properly as a quasi static or dynamic magnetic field sensor. Moreover the magnetometer is small in size much less than a square centimeter weight milli microgram mass power consumption in the milliwatt range provides excellent sensor resolution approximately 1 nanoTesla possesses a large dynamic range approximately 80 dB and has a low cost of manufacturing. The magnetometer device can measure 1 Tesla through 1 nanoTesla field strengths. The large dynamic range is attainable due to the ability to scale the LF drive current to prevent overdriving of the magnetometer device in strong fields that would otherwise destroy the magnetometer device .

The deflectable resonator comprises a torsional loop configuration according to one embodiment of the invention. Additionally the LF drive conductor comprises conductive material configured for receiving the current I at a resonant frequency capable of causing the mechanical deformation of the deflectable resonator . Moreover application of the current I in the presence of a magnetic field B causes formation of Lorentz forces F wherein the Lorentz forces F are in a plane normal to the current vector I and the magnetic field vector B. Furthermore the deflectable resonator is mechanically deformed as a result of the formation of the Lorentz forces F.

Moreover the piezoelectric sensor comprises a bottom electrode a piezoelectric layer over and adjacent to the bottom electrode a top electrode over and adjacent to the piezoelectric layer and an isolator electrically isolating the bottom electrode from the top electrode . Also the magnetometer further comprises a first interconnect structure connected to the LF drive conductor and a second interconnect structure connected to the piezoelectric sensor wherein the second interconnect structure is electrically isolated from the first interconnect structure .

Furthermore the magnetometer may be used for orientation sensing of projectiles used in military and non military environments.
