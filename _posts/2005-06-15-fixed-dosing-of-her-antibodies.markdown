This is a non provisional application filed under 37 CFR 1.53 b claiming priority to provisional application 60 645 697 filed Jan. 21 2005 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases are important mediators of cell growth differentiation and survival. The receptor family includes four distinct members including epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR ErbB1 or HER1 HER2 ErbB2 or p185 HER3 ErbB3 and HER4 ErbB4 or tyro2 .

EGFR encoded by the erbB1 gene has been causally implicated in human malignancy. In particular increased expression of EGFR has been observed in breast bladder lung head neck and stomach cancer as well as glioblastomas. Increased EGFR receptor expression is often associated with increased production of the EGFR ligand transforming growth factor alpha TGF by the same tumor cells resulting in receptor activation by an autocrine stimulatory pathway. Baselga and Mendelsohn 64 127 154 1994 . Monoclonal antibodies directed against the EGFR or its ligands TGF and EGF have been evaluated as therapeutic agents in the treatment of such malignancies. See e.g. Baselga and Mendelsohn supra Masui et al. 44 1002 1007 1984 and Wu et al. 95 1897 1905 1995 .

The second member of the HER family p185 was originally identified as the product of the transforming gene from neuroblastomas of chemically treated rats. The activated form of the neu proto oncogene results from a point mutation valine to glutamic acid in the transmembrane region of the encoded protein. Amplification of the human homolog of neu is observed in breast and ovarian cancers and correlates with a poor prognosis Slamon et al. 235 177 182 1987 Slamon et al. 244 707 712 1989 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 968 603 . To date no point mutation analogous to that in the neu proto oncogene has been reported for human tumors. Overexpression of HER2 frequently but not uniformly due to gene amplification has also been observed in other carcinomas including carcinomas of the stomach endometrium salivary gland lung kidney colon thyroid pancreas and bladder. See among others King et al. 229 974 1985 Yokota et al. 1 765 767 1986 Fukushige et al. 6 955 958 1986 Guerin et al. 3 21 31 1988 Cohen et al. 4 81 88 1989 Yonemura et al. 51 1034 1991 Borst et al. 38 364 1990 Weiner et al. 50 421 425 1990 Kern et al. 50 5184 1990 Park et al. 49 6605 1989 Zhau et al. 3 254 257 1990 Aasland et al. 57 358 363 1988 Williams et al. Pathobiology 59 46 52 1991 and McCann et al. 65 88 92 1990 . HER2 may be overexpressed in prostate cancer Gu et al. 99 185 9 1996 Ross et al. 28 827 33 1997 Ross et al. 79 2162 70 1997 and Sadasivan et al. 150 126 31 1993 .

Drebin and colleagues have raised antibodies against the rat neu gene product p185See for example Drebin et al. 41 695 706 1985 Myers et al. 198 277 290 1991 and WO94 22478. Drebin et al. 2 273 277 1988 report that mixtures of antibodies reactive with two distinct regions of p185result in synergistic anti tumor effects on neu transformed NIH 3T3 cells implanted into nude mice. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 824 311 issued Oct. 20 1998.

Hudziak et al. 9 3 1165 1172 1989 describe the generation of a panel of HER2 antibodies which were characterized using the human breast tumor cell line SK BR 3. Relative cell proliferation of the SK BR 3 cells following exposure to the antibodies was determined by crystal violet staining of the monolayers after 72 hours. Using this assay maximum inhibition was obtained with the antibody called 4D5 which inhibited cellular proliferation by 56 . Other antibodies in the panel reduced cellular proliferation to a lesser extent in this assay. The antibody 4D5 was further found to sensitize HER2 overexpressing breast tumor cell lines to the cytotoxic effects of TNF . See also U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 issued Oct. 14 1997. The HER2 antibodies discussed in Hudziak et al. are further characterized in Fendly et al. 50 1550 1558 1990 Kotts et al. 26 3 59A 1990 Sarup et al. 1 72 82 1991 Shepard et al. 11 3 117 127 1991 Kumar et al. 1 2 979 986 1991 Lewis et al. 37 255 263 1993 Pietras et al. 9 1829 1838 1994 Vitetta et al. 54 5301 5309 1994 Sliwkowski et al. 269 20 14661 14665 1994 Scott et al. 266 14300 5 1991 D souza et al. 91 7202 7206 1994 Lewis et al. 56 1457 1465 1996 and Schaefer et al. 15 1385 1394 1997 .

A recombinant humanized version of the murine HER2 antibody 4D5 huMAb4D5 8 rhuMAb HER2 trastuzumab or HERCEPTIN U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 is clinically active in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancers that have received extensive prior anti cancer therapy Baselga et al. 14 737 744 1996 . Trastuzumab received marketing approval from the Food and Drug Administration Sep. 25 1998 for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 protein.

Other HER2 antibodies with various properties have been described in Tagliabue et al. 47 933 937 1991 McKenzie et al. 4 543 548 1989 Maier et al. 51 5361 5369 1991 Bacus et al. 3 350 362 1990 Stancovski et al. USA 88 8691 8695 1991 Bacus et al. 52 2580 2589 1992 Xu et al. 53 401 408 1993 WO94 00136 Kasprzyk et al. 52 2771 2776 1992 Hancock et al. 51 4575 4580 1991 Shawver et al. 54 1367 1373 1994 Arteaga et al. 54 3758 3765 1994 Harwerth et al. 267 15160 15167 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 783 186 and Klapper et al. 14 2099 2109 1997 .

Homology screening has resulted in the identification of two other HER receptor family members HER3 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 183 884 and 5 480 968 as well as Kraus et al. USA 86 9193 9197 1989 and HER4 EP Pat Appln No 599 274 Plowman et al. 90 1746 1750 1993 and Plowman et al. 366 473 475 1993 . Both of these receptors display increased expression on at least some breast cancer cell lines.

The HER receptors are generally found in various combinations in cells and heterodimerization is thought to increase the diversity of cellular responses to a variety of HER ligands Earp et al. 35 115 132 1995 . EGFR is bound by six different ligands epidermal growth factor EGF transforming growth factor alpha TGF amphiregulin heparin binding epidermal growth factor HB EGF betacellulin and epiregulin Groenen et al. 11 235 257 1994 . A family of heregulin proteins resulting from alternative splicing of a single gene are ligands for HER3 and HER4. The heregulin family includes alpha beta and gamma heregulins Holmes et al. 256 1205 1210 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 869 and Schaefer et al. 15 1385 1394 1997 neu differentiation factors NDFs glial growth factors GGFs acetylcholine receptor inducing activity ARIA and sensory and motor neuron derived factor SMDF . For a review see Groenen et al. 11 235 257 1994 Lemke G. . 7 247 262 1996 and Lee et al. 47 51 85 1995 . Recently three additional HER ligands were identified neuregulin 2 NRG 2 which is reported to bind either HER3 or HER4 Chang et al. 387 509 512 1997 and Carraway et al 387 512 516 1997 neuregulin 3 which binds HER4 Zhang et al. USA 94 18 9562 7 1997 and neuregulin 4 which binds HER4 Harari et al. 18 2681 89 1999 HB EGF betacellulin and epiregulin also bind to HER4.

While EGF and TGF do not bind HER2 EGF stimulates EGFR and HER2 to form a heterodimer which activates EGFR and results in transphosphorylation of HER2 in the heterodimer. Dimerization and or transphosphorylation appears to activate the HER2 tyrosine kinase. See Earp et al. supra. Likewise when HER3 is co expressed with HER2 an active signaling complex is formed and antibodies directed against HER2 are capable of disrupting this complex Sliwkowski et al. 269 20 14661 14665 1994 . Additionally the affinity of HER3 for heregulin HRG is increased to a higher affinity state when co expressed with HER2. See also Levi et al. 15 1329 1340 1995 Morrissey et al. 92 1431 1435 1995 and Lewis et al. 56 1457 1465 1996 with respect to the HER2 HER3 protein complex. HER4 like HER3 forms an active signaling complex with HER2 Carraway and Cantley 78 5 8 1994 .

Pertuzumab also known as recombinant human monoclonal antibody 2C4 OMNITARG Genentech mc South San Francisco represents the first in a new class of agents known as HER dimerization inhibitors HDI and functions to inhibit the ability of HER2 to form active heterodimers with other HER receptors such as EGFR HER1 HER3 and HER4 and is active irrespective of HER2 expression levelsEN.REFLIST. See for example Harari and Yarden Oncogene 19 6102 14 2000 Yarden and Sliwkowski. 2 127 37 2001 Sliwkowski 10 158 9 2003 Cho etal. 421 756 60 2003 and Malik et al. 44 176 7 2003 .

Pertuzumab blockade of the formation of HER2 HER3 heterodimers in tumor cells has been demonstrated to inhibit critical cell signaling which results in reduced tumor proliferation and survival Agus et al. 2 127 37 2002 .

Pertuzumab has undergone testing as a single agent in the clinic with a phase Ia trial in patients with advanced cancers and phase II trials in patients with ovarian cancer and breast cancer as well as lung and prostate cancer. In a Phase I study patients with incurable locally advanced recurrent or metastatic solid tumors that had progressed during or after standard therapy were treated with pertuzumab given intravenously every 3 weeks. Pertuzumab was generally well tolerated. Tumor regression was achieved in 3 of 20 patients evaluable for response. Two patients had confirmed partial responses. Stable disease lasting for more than 2.5 months was observed in 6 of 21 patients Agus et al. 22 192 2003 . At doses of 2.0 15 mg kg the pharmacokinetic of pertuzumab was linear and mean clearance ranged from 2.69 to 3.74 mL day kg and the mean terminal elimination half life ranged from 15.3 to 27.6 days. Antibodies to pertuzumab were not detected Allison et al. 22 197 2003 . Pertuzumab was dosed on a weight basis mg kg in the Phase I trial. Phase II trials have been initiated using a fixed dose.

The present invention provides the first critical assessment of the impact and utility of fixed dosing of a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody on pharmacokinetics and target drug concentrations. The primary objectives of this analysis of the HER antibody pertuzumab were to 1 evaluate the population pharmacokinetic and predictive covariates for pertuzumab in cancer patients and 2 examine the variability of steady state trough concentrations and exposures after fixed or body weight and body surface area BSA based dosing.

Accordingly in a first aspect the invention provides a method for treating cancer comprising administering one or more fixed dose s of a HER antibody to a human patient in an amount effective to treat the cancer.

In another aspect the invention provides a method of treating cancer in a human patient comprising administering at least one fixed dose of pertuzumab to the patient wherein the fixed dose is selected from the group consisting of approximately 420 mg approximately 525 mg approximately 840 mg and approximately 1050 mg of pertuzumab.

The invention also concerns an article of manufacture comprising a vial containing a fixed dose of a HER antibody wherein the fixed dose is selected from the group consisting of approximately 420 mg approximately 525 mg approximately 840 mg and approximately 1050 mg of the HER antibody.

A fixed or flat dose of a therapeutic agent herein refers to a dose that is administered to a human patient without regard for the weight WT or body surface area BSA of the patient. The fixed or flat dose is therefore not provided as a mg kg dose or a mg mdose but rather as an absolute amount of the therapeutic agent.

A loading dose herein generally comprises an initial dose of a therapeutic agent administered to a patient and is followed by one or more maintenance dose s thereof. Generally a single loading dose is administered but multiple loading doses are contemplated herein. Usually the amount of loading dose s administered exceeds the amount of the maintenance dose s administered and or the loading dose s are administered more frequently than the maintenance dose s so as to achieve the desired steady state concentration of the therapeutic agent earlier than can be achieved with the maintenance dose s .

A maintenance dose herein refers to one or more doses of a therapeutic agent administered to the patient over a treatment period. Usually the maintenance doses are administered at spaced treatment intervals such as approximately every week approximately every 2 weeks approximately every 3 weeks or approximately every 4 weeks.

A HER receptor is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase which belongs to the HER receptor family and includes EGFR HER2 HER3 and HER4 receptors. The HER receptor will generally comprise an extracellular domain which may bind an HER ligand and or dimerize with another HER receptor molecule a lipophilic transmembrane domain a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and a carboxyl terminal signaling domain harboring several tyrosine residues which can be phosphorylated. The HER receptor may be a native sequence HER receptor or an amino acid sequence variant thereof. Preferably the HER receptor is native sequence human HER receptor.

The terms ErbB1 HER1 epidermal growth factor receptor and EGFR are used interchangeably herein and refer to EGFR as disclosed for example in Carpenter et al. 56 881 914 1987 including naturally occurring mutant forms thereof e.g. a deletion mutant EGFR as in Humphrey et al. 87 4207 4211 1990 . erbBI refers to the gene encoding the EGFR protein product.

The expressions ErbB2 and HER2 are used interchangeably herein and refer to human HER2 protein described for example in Semba et al.

A HER dimer herein is a noncovalently associated dimer comprising at least two HER receptors. Such complexes may form when a cell expressing two or more HER receptors is exposed to an HER ligand and can be isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS PAGE as described in Sliwkowski et al. 269 20 14661 14665 1994 for example. Examples of such HER dimers include EGFR HER2 HER2 HER3 and HER3 HER4 heterodimers. Moreover the HER dimer may comprise two or more HER2 receptors combined with a different HER receptor such as HER3 HER4 or EGFR. Other proteins such as a cytokine receptor subunit e.g. gp130 may be associated with the dimer.

A HER inhibitor is an agent which interferes with HER activation or function. Examples of HER inhibitors include HER antibodies e.g. EGFR HER2 HER3 or HER4 antibodies EGFR targeted drugs small molecule HER antagonists HER tyrosine kinase inhibitors HER2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as lapatinib GW572016 antisense molecules see for example WO2004 87207 and or agents that bind to or interfere with function of downstream signaling molecules such as MAPK or Akt see . Preferably the HER inhibitor is an antibody or small molecule which binds to a HER receptor.

A HER antibody is an antibody that binds to a HER receptor. Optionally the HER antibody further interferes with HER activation or function. Preferably the HER antibody binds to the HER2 receptor. A HER2 antibody of particular interest herein is pertuzumab. Another example of a HER2 antibody is trastuzumab. Examples of EGFR antibodies include cetuximab and ABX0303.

 HER activation refers to activation or phosphorylation of any one or more HER receptors. Generally HER activation results in signal transduction e.g. that caused by an intracellular kinase domain of a HER receptor phosphorylating tyrosine residues in the HER receptor or a substrate polypeptide . HER activation may be mediated by HER ligand binding to a HER dimer comprising the HER receptor of interest. HER ligand binding to a HER dimer may activate a kinase domain of one or more of the HER receptors in the dimer and thereby results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in one or more of the HER receptors and or phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in additional substrate polypeptides s such as Akt or MAPK intracellular kinases. See for example.

 Phosphorylation refers to the addition of one or more phosphate group s to a protein such as a HER receptor or substrate thereof.

An antibody which inhibits HER dimerization is an antibody which inhibits or interferes with formation of a HER dimer. Preferably such an antibody binds to HER2 at the heterodimeric binding site thereof. The most preferred dimerization inhibiting antibody herein is pertuzumab or MAb 2C4. Binding of 2C4 to the heterodimeric binding site of HER2 is illustrated in . Other examples of antibodies which inhibit HER dimerization include antibodies which bind to EGFR and inhibit dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors for example EGFR monoclonal antibody 806 MAb 806 which binds to activated or untethered EGFR see Johns et al. 279 29 30375 30384 2004 antibodies which bind to HER3 and inhibit dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors and antibodies which bind to HER4 and inhibit dimerization thereof with one or more other HER receptors.

An antibody which inhibits HER dimerization more effectively than trastuzumab is one which reduces or eliminates HER dimers more effectively for example at least about 2 fold more effectively than trastuzumab. Preferably such an antibody inhibits HER2 dimerization at least about as effectively as an antibody selected from the group consisting of murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 a Fab fragment of murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 pertuzumab and a Fab fragment of pertuzumab. One can evaluate HER dimerization inhibition by studying HER dimers directly or by evaluating HER activation or downstream signaling which results from HER dimerization and or by evaluating the antibody HER2 binding site etc. Assays for screening for antibodies with the ability to inhibit HER dimerization more effectively than trastuzumab are described in Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 and WO01 00245 Adams et al. . By way of example only one may assay for inhibition of HER dimerization by assessing for example inhibition of HER dimer formation see e.g. of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 and WO01 00245 reduction in HER ligand activation of cells which express HER dimers WO01 00245 and of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 for example blocking of HER ligand binding to cells which express HER dimers WO01 00245 and of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 for example cell growth inhibition of cancer cells e.g. MCF7 MDA MD 134 ZR 75 1 MD MB 175 T47D cells which express HER dimers in the presence or absence of HER ligand WO01 00245 and of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 for instance inhibition of downstream signaling for instance inhibition of HRG dependent AKT phosphorylation or inhibition of HRG or TGF dependent MAPK phosphorylation see WO01 00245 and of Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 for example . One may also assess whether the antibody inhibits HER dimerization by studying the antibody HER2 binding site for instance by evaluating a structure or model such as a crystal structure of the antibody bound to HER2 See for example Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 .

A heterodimeric binding site on HER2 refers to a region in the extracellular domain of HER2 that contacts or interfaces with a region in the extracellular domain of EGFR HER3 or HER4 upon formation of a dimer therewith. The region is found in Domain II of HER2. Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 .

The HER2 antibody may inhibit HRG dependent AKT phosphorylation and or inhibit HRG or TGF dependent MAPK phosphorylation more effectively for instance at least 2 fold more effectively than trastuzumab see Agus et al. 2 127 137 2002 and WO01 00245 by way of example .

The HER2 antibody may be one which does not inhibit HER2 ectodomain cleavage Molina et al. 61 4744 4749 2001 .

A HER2 antibody that binds to a heterodimeric binding site of HER2 binds to residues in domain II and optionally also binds to residues in other of the domains of the HER2 extracellular domain such as domains I and III and can sterically hinder at least to some extent formation of a HER2 EGFR HER2 HER3 or HER2 HER4 heterodimer. Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 characterize the HER2 pertuzumab crystal structure deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank ID Code IS78 illustrating an exemplary antibody that binds to the heterodimeric binding site of HER2.

An antibody that binds to domain II of HER2 binds to residues in domain II and optionally residues in other domain s of HER2 such as domains I and III. Preferably the antibody that binds to domain II binds to the junction between domains I II and III of HER2.

A native sequence polypeptide is one which has the same amino acid sequence as a polypeptide e.g. HER receptor or HER ligand derived from nature. Such native sequence polypeptides can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. Thus a native sequence polypeptide can have the amino acid sequence of naturally occurring human polypeptide murine polypeptide or polypeptide from any other mammalian species.

The term antibody herein is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies formed from at least two intact antibodies and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and or bind the same epitope s except for possible variants that may arise during production of the monoclonal antibody such variants generally being present in minor amounts. Such monoclonal antibody typically includes an antibody comprising a polypeptide sequence that binds a target wherein the target binding polypeptide sequence was obtained by a process that includes the selection of a single target binding polypeptide sequence from a plurality of polypeptide sequences. For example the selection process can be the selection of a unique clone from a plurality of clones such as a pool of hybridoma clones phage clones or recombinant DNA clones. It should be understood that the selected target binding sequence can be further altered for example to improve affinity for the target to humanize the target binding sequence to improve its production in cell culture to reduce its immunogenicity in vivo to create a multispecific antibody etc. and that an antibody comprising the altered target binding sequence is also a monoclonal antibody of this invention. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. In addition to their specificity the monoclonal antibody preparations are advantageous in that they are typically uncontaminated by other immunoglobulins. The modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques including for example the hybridoma method e.g. Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 Harlow et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 recombinant DNA methods see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 phage display technologies see e.g. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 Sidhu et al. 338 2 299 310 2004 Lee et al. 340 5 1073 1093 2004 Fellouse 101 34 12467 12472 2004 and Lee et al. 284 1 2 119 132 2004 and technologies for producing human or human like antibodies in animals that have parts or all of the human immunoglobulin loci or genes encoding human immunoglobulin sequences see e.g. WO 1998 24893 WO 1996 34096 WO 1996 33735 WO 1991 10741 Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat.

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Chimeric antibodies of interest herein include primatized antibodies comprising variable domain antigen binding sequences derived from a non human primate e.g. Old World Monkey Ape etc and human constant region sequences.

 Antibody fragments comprise a portion of an intact antibody preferably comprising the antigen binding region thereof. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment s .

An intact antibody herein is one which comprises two antigen binding regions and an Fc region. Preferably the intact antibody has one or more effector functions.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains intact antibodies can be assigned to different classes . There are five major classes of intact antibodies IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these may be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 IgG4 IgA and IgA2. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of antibodies are called a and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known.

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to an Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor BCR etc.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and ADCC refer to a cell mediated reaction in which nonspecific cytotoxic cells that express Fc receptors FcRs e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages recognize bound antibody on a target cell and subsequently cause lysis of the target cell. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells in summarized is Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. USA 95 652 656 1998 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source thereof e.g. from blood or PBMCs as described herein.

The terms Fc receptor or FcR are used to describe a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain see review M. in Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 and regulates homeostasis of immunoglobulins.

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the ability of a molecule to lyse a target in the presence of complement. The complement activation pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to a molecule e.g. an antibody complexed with a cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed.

 Native antibodies are usually heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150 000 daltons composed of two identical light L chains and two identical heavy H chains. Each light chain is linked to a heavy chain by one covalent disulfide bond while the number of disulfide linkages varies among the heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each heavy chain has at one end a variable domain V followed by a number of constant domains. Each light chain has a variable domain at one end V and a constant domain at its other end. The constant domain of the light chain is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain and the light chain variable domain is aligned with the variable domain of the heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework regions FRs . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FRs largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three hypervariable regions which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The hypervariable regions in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FRs and with the hypervariable regions from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC .

The term hypervariable region when used herein refers to the amino acid residues of an antibody which are responsible for antigen binding. The hypervariable region generally comprises amino acid residues from a complementarity determining region or CDR e.g. residues 24 34 L1 50 56 L2 and 89 97 L3 in the light chain variable domain and 31 35 H1 50 65 H2 and 95 102 H3 in the heavy chain variable domain Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 and or those residues from a hypervariable loop e.g. residues 26 32 L1 50 52 L2 and 91 96 L3 in the light chain variable domain and 26 32 H1 53 55 H2 and 96 101 H3 in the heavy chain variable domain Chothia and Lesk 196 901 917 1987 . Framework Region or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen binding sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and antigen binding site. This region consists of a dimer of one heavy chain and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. It is in this configuration that the three hypervariable regions of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the V Vdimer. Collectively the six hypervariable regions confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three hypervariable regions specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear at least one free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The light chains of antibodies from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the Vand Vdomains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Preferably the Fv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the Vand Vdomains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pl ckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 . HER2 antibody scFv fragments are described in WO93 16185 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 894 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 587 458.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a variable heavy domain V connected to a variable light domain V in the same polypeptide chain V V . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 .

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. rodent antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 .

A naked antibody is an antibody that is not conjugated to a heterologous molecule such as a cytotoxic moiety or radiolabel.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions thereof which result an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by Vand Vdomain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al. 226 889 896 1992 .

The term main species antibody herein refers to the antibody structure in a composition which is the quantitatively predominant antibody molecule in the composition. In one embodiment the main species antibody is a HER2 antibody such as an antibody that binds to Domain II of HER2 antibody that inhibits HER dimerization more effectively than trastuzumab and or an antibody which binds to a heterodimeric binding site of HER2.

The antibody variant of particular interest herein is the antibody comprising an amino terminal leader extension on one or two light chains thereof optionally further comprising other amino acid sequence and or glycosylation differences relative to the main species antibody.

A glycosylation variant antibody herein is an antibody with one or more carbohydrate moeities attached thereto which differ from one or more carbohydate moieties attached to a main species antibody. Examples of glycosylation variants herein include antibody with a G1 or G2 oligosaccharide structure instead a G0 oligosaccharide structure attached to an Fc region thereof antibody with one or two carbohydrate moieties attached to one or two light chains thereof antibody with no carbohydrate attached to one or two heavy chains of the antibody etc and combinations of glycosylation alterations.

Where the antibody has an Fc region an oligosaccharide structure such as that shown in herein may be attached to one or two heavy chains of the antibody e.g. at residue 299 298 Eu numbering of residues . For pertuzumab G0 was the predominant oligosaccharide structure with other oligosaccharide structures such as G0 F G 1 Man5 Man6 G1 1 G1 1 6 G1 1 3 and G2 being found in lesser amounts in the pertuzumab composition.

Unless indicated otherwise a G1 oligosaccharide structure herein includes G 1 G1 1 G1 1 6 and G1 1 3 structures.

An amino terminal leader extension herein refers to one or more amino acid residues of the amino terminal leader sequence that are present at the amino terminus of any one or more heavy or light chains of an antibody. An exemplary amino terminal leader extension comprises or consists of three amino acid residues VHS present on one or both light chains of an antibody variant.

A deamidated antibody is one in which one or more asparagine residues thereof has been derivitized e.g. to an aspartic acid a succinimide or an iso aspartic acid.

The terms cancer and cancerous refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include but are not limited to carcinoma lymphoma blastoma including medulloblastoma and retinoblastoma sarcoma including liposarcoma and synovial cell sarcoma neuroendocrine tumors including carcinoid tumors gastrinoma and islet cell cancer mesothelioma schwannoma including acoustic neuroma meningioma adenocarcinoma melanoma and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer e.g. epithelial squamous cell cancer lung cancer including small cell lung cancer SCLC non small cell lung cancer NSCLC adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung cancer of the peritoneum hepatocellular cancer gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer pancreatic cancer glioblastoma cervical cancer ovarian cancer liver cancer bladder cancer hepatoma breast cancer including metastatic breast cancer colon cancer rectal cancer colorectal cancer endometrial or uterine carcinoma salivary gland carcinoma kidney or renal cancer prostate cancer vulval cancer thyroid cancer hepatic carcinoma anal carcinoma penile carcinoma testicular cancer esophagael cancer tumors of the biliary tract as well as head and neck cancer.

Herein a patient is a human patient. The patient may be a cancer patient i.e. one who is suffering or at risk for suffering from one or more symptoms of cancer or other patient who could benefit from therapy with a HER antibody.

A tumor sample herein is a sample derived from or comprising tumor cells from a patient s tumor. Examples of tumor samples herein include but are not limited to tumor biopsies circulating tumor cells circulating plasma proteins ascitic fluid primary cell cultures or cell lines derived from tumors or exhibiting tumor like properties as well as preserved tumor samples such as formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor samples or frozen tumor samples.

An embedded tumor sample is one surrounded by a firm and generally hard medium such as paraffin wax celloidin or a resin. Embedding makes possible the cutting of thin sections for microscopic examination or for generation of tissue microarrays TMAs .

A paraffin embedded tumor sample is one surrounded by a purified mixture of solid hydrocarbons derived from petroleum.

A cancer or biological sample which displays HER expression amplification or activation is one which in a diagnostic test expresses including overexpresses a HER receptor has amplified HER gene and or otherwise demonstrates activation or phosphorylation of a HER receptor. Such activation can be determined directly e.g. by measuring HER phosphorylation or indirectly e.g. by gene expression profiling or by detecting HER heterodimers as described herein .

A cancer with HER receptor overexpression or amplification is one which has significantly higher levels of a HER receptor protein or gene compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Such overexpression may be caused by gene amplification or by increased transcription or translation. HER receptor overexpression or amplification may be determined in a diagnostic or prognostic assay by evaluating increased levels of the HER protein present on the surface of a cell e.g. via an immunohistochemistry assay IHC . Alternatively or additionally one may measure levels of HER encoding nucleic acid in the cell e.g. via fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH see WO98 45479 published October 1998 southern blotting or polymerase chain reaction PCR techniques such as quantitative real time PCR qRT PCR . One may also study HER receptor overexpression or amplification by measuring shed antigen e.g. HER extracellular domain in a biological fluid such as serum see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 933 294 issued Jun. 12 1990 WO91 05264 published Apr. 18 1991 U.S. Pat. No. 5 401 638 issued Mar. 28 1995 and Sias et al. 132 73 80 1990 . Aside from the above assays various in vivo assays are available to the skilled practitioner. For example one may expose cells within the body of the patient to an antibody which is optionally labeled with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope and binding of the antibody to cells in the patient can be evaluated e.g. by external scanning for radioactivity or by analyzing a biopsy taken from a patient previously exposed to the antibody.

Conversely a cancer which does not overexpress or amplify HER receptor is one which does not have higher than normal levels of HER receptor protein or gene compared to a noncancerous cell of the same tissue type. Antibodies that inhibit HER dimerization such as pertuzumab may be used to treat cancer which does not overexpress or amplify HER2 receptor.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell especially a HER expressing cancer cell either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of HER expressing cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topo II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C. Further information can be found in Mendelsohn and Israel eds. Chapter 1 entitled Cell cycle regulation oncogenes and antineoplastic drugs by Murakami et al. WB Saunders Philadelphia 1995 especially p. 13.

Examples of growth inhibitory antibodies are those which bind to HER2 and inhibit the growth of cancer cells overexpressing HER2. Preferred growth inhibitory HER2 antibodies inhibit growth of SK BR 3 breast tumor cells in cell culture by greater than 20 and preferably greater than 50 e.g. from about 50 to about 100 at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml where the growth inhibition is determined six days after exposure of the SK BR 3 cells to the antibody see U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 issued Oct. 14 1997 . The SK BR 3 cell growth inhibition assay is described in more detail in that patent and hereinbelow. The preferred growth inhibitory antibody is a humanized variant of murine monoclonal antibody 4D5 e.g. trastuzumab.

An antibody which induces apoptosis is one which induces programmed cell death as determined by binding of annexin V fragmentation of DNA cell shrinkage dilation of endoplasmic reticulum cell fragmentation and or formation of membrane vesicles called apoptotic bodies . The cell is usually one which overexpresses the HER2 receptor. Preferably the cell is a tumor cell e.g. a breast ovarian stomach endometrial salivary gland lung kidney colon thyroid pancreatic or bladder cell. In vitro the cell may be a SK BR 3 BT474 Calu 3 cell MDA MB 453 MDA MB 361 or SKOV3 cell. Various methods are available for evaluating the cellular events associated with apoptosis. For example phosphatidyl serine PS translocation can be measured by annexin binding DNA fragmentation can be evaluated through DNA laddering and nuclear chromatin condensation along with DNA fragmentation can be evaluated by any increase in hypodiploid cells. Preferably the antibody which induces apoptosis is one which results in about 2 to 50 fold preferably about 5 to 50 fold and most preferably about 10 to 50 fold induction of annexin binding relative to untreated cell in an annexin binding assay using BT474 cells see below . Examples of HER2 antibodies that induce apoptosis are 7C2 and 7F3.

The epitope 2C4 is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody 2C4 binds. In order to screen for antibodies which bind to the 2C4 epitope a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. Preferably the antibody blocks 2C4 s binding to HER2 by about 50 or more. Alternatively epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds to the 2C4 epitope of HER2. Epitope 2C4 comprises residues from Domain II in the extracellular domain of HER2. 2C4 and pertuzumab binds to the extracellular domain of HER2 at the junction of domains I II and III. Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 .

The epitope 4D5 is the region in the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the antibody 4D5 ATCC CRL 10463 and trastuzumab bind. This epitope is close to the transmembrane domain of HER2 and within Domain IV of HER2. To screen for antibodies which bind to the 4D5 epitope a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. Alternatively epitope mapping can be performed to assess whether the antibody binds to the 4D5 epitope of HER2 e.g. any one or more residues in the region from about residue 529 to about residue 625 inclusive of the HER2 ECD residue numbering including signal peptide .

The epitope 7C2 7F3 is the region at the N terminus within Domain I of the extracellular domain of HER2 to which the 7C2 and or 7F3 antibodies each deposited with the ATCC see below bind. To screen for antibodies which bind to the 7C2 7F3 epitope a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. Alternatively epitope mapping can be performed to establish whether the antibody binds to the 7C2 7F3 epitope on HER2 e.g. any one or more of residues in the region from about residue 22 to about residue 53 of the HER2 ECD residue numbering including signal peptide .

 Treatment refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disease as well as those in which the disease is to be prevented. Hence the patient to be treated herein may have been diagnosed as having the disease or may be predisposed or susceptible to the disease.

The term effective amount refers to an amount of a drug effective to treat cancer in the patient. The effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells reduce the tumor size inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs inhibit i.e. slow to some extent and preferably stop tumor metastasis inhibit to some extent tumor growth and or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and or kill existing cancer cells it may be cytostatic and or cytotoxic. The effective amount may extend progression free survival e.g. as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors RECIST or CA 125 changes result in an objective response including a partial response PR or complete respose CR increase overall survival time and or improve one or more symptoms of cancer e.g. as assessed by FOSI .

 Overall survival refers to the patient remaining alive for a defined period of time such as 1 year 5 years etc e.g. from the time of diagnosis or treatment.

 Progression free survival refers to the patient remaining alive without the cancer getting worse. An objective response refers to a measurable response including complete response CR or partial response PR .

By complete response or complete remission is intended the disappearance of all signs of cancer in response to treatment. This does not always mean the cancer has been cured.

 Partial response refers to a decrease in the size of one or more tumors or lesions or in the extent of cancer in the body in response to treatment.

The term cytotoxic agent as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells.

A benign hyperproliferative disorder is meant a state in a patient that relates to cell proliferation and which is recognized as abnormal by members of the medical community. An abnormal state is characterized by a level of a property that is statistically different from the level observed in organisms not suffering from the disorder. Cell proliferation refers to growth or extension by multiplication of cells and includes cell division. The rate of cell proliferation may be measured by counting the number of cells produced in a given unit of time. Examples of benign hyperproliferative disorders include psoriasis and polyps.

A respiratory disease involves the respiratory system and includes chronic bronchitis asthma including acute asthma and allergic asthma cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis allergic or other rhinitis or sinusitis 1 antitrypsin deficiency coughs pulmonary emphysema pulmonary fibrosis or hyper reactive airways chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic obstructive lung disorder.

 Psoriasis is a condition characterized by the eruption of circumscribed discrete and confluent reddish silvery scaled maculopapules. Psoriatic lesions generally occur predominantly on the elbows knees scalp and trunk and microscopically show characteristic parakerotosis and elongation of rete ridges. The term includes the various forms of psoriasis including erythrodermic pustular moderate severe and recalcitrant forms of the disease.

 Endometriosis refers to the ectopic occurrence of endometrial tissue frequently forming cysts containing altered blood.

The term vascular disease or disorder herein refers to the various diseases or disorders which impact the vascular system including the cardiovascular system. Examples of such diseases include arteriosclerosis vascular reobstruction atherosclerosis postsurgical vascular stenosis restenosis vascular occlusion or carotid obstructive disease coronary artery disease angina small vessel disease hypercholesterolemia hypertension and conditions involving abnormal proliferation or function of vascular epithelial cells.

The term stenosis refers to narrowing or stricture of a hollow passage e g a duct or canal in the body.

The term vascular stenosis refers to occlusion or narrowing of blood vessels. Vascular stenosis often results from fatty deposit as in the case of atherosclerosis or excessive migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. Arteries are particularly susceptible to stenosis. The term stenosis as used herein specifically includes initial stenosis and restenosis.

The term restenosis refers to recurrence of stenosis after treatment of initial stenosis with apparent success. For example restenosis in the context of vascular stenosis refers to the reoccurrence of vascular stenosis after it has been treated with apparent success e.g. by removal of fatty deposit by angioplasty e.g. percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty direction coronary atherectomy or stent etc. One of the contributing factors in restenosis is intimal hyperplasia. The term intimal hyperplasia used interchangeably with neointimal hyperplasia and neointima formation refers to thickening of the inner most layer of blood vessels intima as a consequence of excessive proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. The various changes taking place during restenosis are often collectively referred to as vascular wall remodeling. 

The terms balloon angioplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty PTCA are often used interchangeably and refer to a non surgical catheter based treatment for removal of plaque from the coronary artery. Stenosis or restenosis often lead to hypertension as a result of increased resistance to blood flow.

The term hypertension refers to abnormally high blood pressure i.e. beyond the upper value of the normal range.

 Polyps refers to a mass of tissue that bulges or projects outward or upward from the normal surface level thereby being macroscopically visible as a hemispheroidal speroidal or irregular moundlike structure growing from a relatively broad base or a slender stalk.

A package insert refers to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic agents that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration contraindications and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.

A description follows as to exemplary techniques for the production of HER antibodies used in accordance with the present invention. The HER antigen to be used for production of antibodies may be e.g. a soluble form of the extracellular domain of HER or a portion thereof containing the desired epitope. Alternatively cells expressing HER at their cell surface e.g. NIH 3T3 cells transformed to overexpress HER2 or a carcinoma cell line such as SK BR 3 cells see Stancovski et al. USA 88 8691 8695 1991 can be used to generate antibodies. Other forms of HER receptor useful for generating antibodies will be apparent to those skilled in the art.

Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized e.g. keyhole limpet hemocyanin serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent for example maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester conjugation through cysteine residues N hydroxysuccinimide through lysine residues glutaraldehyde succinic anhydride SOCl or RN C NR where R and Rare different alkyl groups.

Animals are immunized against the antigen immunogenic conjugates or derivatives by combining e.g. 100 g or 5 g of the protein or conjugate for rabbits or mice respectively with 3 volumes of Freund s complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with 1 5 to 1 10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund s complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Preferably the animal is boosted with the conjugate of the same antigen but conjugated to a different protein and or through a different cross linking reagent. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.

Various methods for making monoclonal antibodies herein are available in the art. For example the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 or X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 and Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al. 5 256 262 1993 and Pl ckthun 130 151 188 1992 .

In a further embodiment monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 . Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies by chain shuffling Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.

The DNA also may be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy chain and light chain constant domains in place of the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 or by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide.

Typically such non immunoglobulin polypeptides are substituted for the constant domains of an antibody or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen combining site having specificity for a different antigen.

Methods for humanizing non human antibodies have been described in the art. Preferably a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework region FR for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. 196 901 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 .

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to a preferred method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

WO01 00245 describes production of exemplary humanized HER2 antibodies which bind HER2 and block ligand activation of a HER receptor. The humanized antibody of particular interest herein blocks EGF TGF and or HRG mediated activation of MAPK essentially as effectively as murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 or a Fab fragment thereof and or binds HER2 essentially as effectively as murine monoclonal antibody 2C4 or a Fab fragment thereof . The humanized antibody herein may for example comprise nonhuman hypervariable region residues incorporated into a human variable heavy domain and may further comprise a framework region FR substitution at a position selected from the group consisting of 69H 71H and 73H utilizing the variable domain numbering system set forth in Kabat et al. 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . In one embodiment the humanized antibody comprises FR substitutions at two or all of positions 69H 71H and 73H.

An exemplary humanized antibody of interest herein comprises variable heavy domain complementarity determining residues GFTFTDYTMX where X is preferrably D or S SEQ ID NO 7 DVNPNSGGSIYNQRFKG SEQ ID NO 8 and or NLGPSFYFDY SEQ ID NO 9 optionally comprising amino acid modifications of those CDR residues e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example the antibody variant of interest may have from about one to about seven or about five amino acid substitutions in the above variable heavy CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared by affinity maturation e.g. as described below. The most preferred humanized antibody comprises the variable heavy domain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 4.

The humanized antibody may comprise variable light domain complementarity determining residues KASQDVSIGVA SEQ ID NO 10 SASYXXX where Xis preferably R or L Xis preferably Y or E and Xis preferably T or S SEQ ID NO 11 and or QQYYIYPYT SEQ ID NO 12 e.g. in addition to those variable heavy domain CDR residues in the preceding paragraph. Such humanized antibodies optionally comprise amino acid modifications of the above CDR residues e.g. where the modifications essentially maintain or improve affinity of the antibody. For example the antibody variant of interest may have from about one to about seven or about five amino acid substitutions in the above variable light CDR sequences. Such antibody variants may be prepared by affinity maturation e.g. as described below. The most preferred humanized antibody comprises the variable light domain amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 3.

The present application also contemplates affinity matured antibodies which bind HER2 and block ligand activation of a HER receptor. The parent antibody may be a human antibody or a humanized antibody e.g. one comprising the variable light and or heavy sequences of SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4 respectively i.e. variant 574 . The affinity matured antibody preferably binds to HER2 receptor with an affinity superior to that of murine 2C4 or variant 574 e.g. from about two or about four fold to about 100 fold or about 1000 fold improved affinity e.g. as assessed using a HER2 extracellular domain ECD ELISA . Exemplary variable heavy CDR residues for substitution include H28 H30 H34 H35 H64 H96 H99 or combinations of two or more e.g. two three four five six or seven of these residues . Examples of variable light CDR residues for alteration include L28 L50 L53 L56 L91 L92 L93 L94 L96 L97 or combinations of two or more e.g. two to three four five or up to about ten of these residues .

Various forms of the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody are contemplated. For example the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an antibody fragment such as a Fab which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent s in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively the humanized antibody or affinity matured antibody may be an intact antibody such as an intact IgG1 antibody. The preferred intact IgG1 antibody comprises the light chain sequence in SEQ ID NO 13 and the heavy chain sequence in SEQ ID NO 14.

As an alternative to humanization human antibodies can be generated. For example it is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region J gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 591 669 5 589 369 and 5 545 807.

Alternatively phage display technology McCafferty et al. 348 552 553 1990 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M113 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats for their review see e.g. Johnson Kevin S. and Chiswell David J. 3 564 571 1993 . Several sources of V gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 isolated a diverse array of anti oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens including self antigens can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or Griffith et al. 12 725 734 1993 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 565 332 and 5 573 905.

As discussed above human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 567 610 and 5 229 275 .

Human HER2 antibodies are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 772 997 issued Jun. 30 1998 and WO 97 00271 published Jan. 3 1997.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments comprising one or more antigen binding regions. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. For example the antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. No. 5 571 894 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 587 458. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the HER2 protein. Other such antibodies may combine a HER2 binding site with binding site s for EGFR HER3 and or HER4. Alternatively a HER2 arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD2 or CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R such as Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 so as to focus cellular defense mechanisms to the HER2 expressing cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express HER2. These antibodies possess a HER2 binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

WO 96 16673 describes a bispecific HER2 Fc RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 234 discloses a bispecific HER2 Fc RI antibody IDM1 Osidem . A bispecific HER2 Fc antibody is shown in WO98 02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 teaches a bispecific HER2 CD3 antibody. MDX 210 is a bispecific HER2 Fc RIII Ab.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain V connected to a light chain variable domain V by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

Amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid changes also may alter post translational processes of the antibody such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid most preferably alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed antibody variants are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of preferred substitutions . If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 1 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes may be introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.

Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody also may be substituted generally with serine to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely cysteine bond s may be added to the antibody to improve its stability particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment .

A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and human HER2. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Another type of amino acid variant of the antibody alters the original glycosylation pattern of the antibody. By altering is meant deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in the antibody and or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the antibody.

Glycosylation of antibodies is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L. See also US 2004 0093621 A1 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd . Antibodies with a bisecting N acetylglucosamine GlcNAc in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO03 011878 Jean Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO97 30087 Patel et al. See also WO98 58964 Raju S. and WO99 22764 Raju S. concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof.

It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance antigen dependent cell mediated cyotoxicity ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 .

WO00 42072 Presta L. describes antibodies with improved ADCC function in the presence of human effector cells where the antibodies comprise amino acid substitutions in the Fc region thereof. Preferably the antibody with improved ADCC comprises substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region. Preferably the altered Fc region is a human IgG1 Fc region comprising or consisting of substitutions at one two or three of these positions.

Antibodies with altered C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC are described in WO99 51642 U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 U.S. Pat. No. 6 242 195B1 U.S. Pat. No. 6 528 624B1 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 538 124 Idusogie et al. . The antibodies comprise an amino acid substitution at one or more of amino acid positions 270 322 326 327 329 313 333 and or 334 of the Fc region thereof.

To increase the serum half life of the antibody one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 739 277 for example. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG IgG IgG or IgG that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule.

Antibodies with improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn and increased half lives are described in WO00 42072 Presta L. . These antibodies comprise a Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. For example the Fc region may have substitutions at one or more of positions 238 256 265 272 286 303 305 307 311 312 317 340 356 360 362 376 378 380 382 413 424 or 434. The preferred Fc region comprising antibody variant with improved FcRn binding comprises amino acid substitutions at one two or three of positions 307 380 and 434 of the Fc region thereof.

Engineered antibodies with three or more preferably four functional antigen binding sites are also contemplated US Appln No. US2002 0004587 A1 Miller et al. .

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

Techniques for generating antibodies have been described above. One may further select antibodies with certain biological characteristics as desired.

To identify an antibody which blocks ligand activation of a HER receptor the ability of the antibody to block HER ligand binding to cells expressing the HER receptor e.g. in conjugation with another HER receptor with which the HER receptor of interest forms a HER hetero oligomer may be determined. For example cells naturally expressing or transfected to express HER receptors of the HER hetero oligomer may be incubated with the antibody and then exposed to labeled HER ligand. The ability of the antibody to block ligand binding to the HER receptor in the HER hetero oligomer may then be evaluated.

For example inhibition of HRG binding to MCF7 breast tumor cell lines by HER2 antibodies may be performed using monolayer MCF7 cultures on ice in a 24 well plate format essentially as described in WO01 00245. HER2 monoclonal antibodies may be added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes. I labeled rHRG 1 25 pm may then be added and the incubation may be continued for 4 to 16 hours. Dose response curves may be prepared and an ICvalue may be calculated for the antibody of interest. In one embodiment the antibody which blocks ligand activation of a HER receptor will have an ICfor inhibiting HRG binding to MCF7 cells in this assay of about 50 nM or less more preferably 10 nM or less. Where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fab fragment the ICfor inhibiting HRG binding to MCF7 cells in this assay may for example be about 100 nM or less more preferably 50 nM or less.

Alternatively or additionally the ability of an antibody to block HER ligand stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a HER receptor present in a HER hetero oligomer may be assessed. For example cells endogenously expressing the HER receptors or transfected to expressed them may be incubated with the antibody and then assayed for HER ligand dependent tyrosine phosphorylation activity using an anti phosphotyrosine monoclonal which is optionally conjugated with a detectable label . The kinase receptor activation assay described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 863 is also available for determining HER receptor activation and blocking of that activity by an antibody.

In one embodiment one may screen for an antibody which inhibits HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation in MCF7 cells essentially as described in WO01 00245. For example the MCF7 cells may be plated in 24 well plates and monoclonal antibodies to HER2 may be added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature then rHRG 1may be added to each well to a final concentration of 0.2 nM and the incubation may be continued for 8 minutes. Media may be aspirated from each well and reactions may be stopped by the addition of 100 l of SDS sample buffer 5 SDS 25 mM DTT and 25 mM Tris HCl pH 6.8 . Each sample 25 l may be electrophoresed on a 4 12 gradient gel Novex and then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antiphosphotyrosine at 1 g ml immunoblots may be developed and the intensity of the predominant reactive band at M 180 000 may be quantified by reflectance densitometry. The antibody selected will preferably significantly inhibit HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation to about 0 35 of control in this assay. A dose response curve for inhibition of HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation as determined by reflectance densitometry may be prepared and an ICfor the antibody of interest may be calculated. In one embodiment the antibody which blocks ligand activation of a HER receptor will have an ICfor inhibiting HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation in this assay of about 50 nM or less more preferably 10 nM or less. Where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as a Fab fragment the ICfor inhibiting HRG stimulation of p180 tyrosine phosphorylation in this assay may for example be about 100 nM or less more preferably 50 nM or less.

One may also assess the growth inhibitory effects of the antibody on MDA MB 175 cells e.g essentially as described in Schaefer et al. 15 1385 1394 1997 . According to this assay MDA MB 175 cells may treated with a HER2 monoclonal antibody 10 g mL for 4 days and stained with crystal violet. Incubation with a HER2 antibody may show a growth inhibitory effect on this cell line similar to that displayed by monoclonal antibody 2C4. In a further embodiment exogenous HRG will not significantly reverse this inhibition. Preferably the antibody will be able to inhibit cell proliferation of MDA MB 175 cells to a greater extent than monoclonal antibody 4D5 and optionally to a greater extent than monoclonal antibody 7F3 both in the presence and absence of exogenous HRG.

In one embodiment the HER2 antibody of interest may block heregulin dependent association of HER2 with HER3 in both MCF7 and SK BR 3 cells as determined in a co immunoprecipitation experiment such as that described in WO01 00245 substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 4D5 and preferably substantially more effectively than monoclonal antibody 7F3.

To identify growth inhibitory HER2 antibodies one may screen for antibodies which inhibit the growth of cancer cells which overexpress HER2. In one embodiment the growth inhibitory antibody of choice is able to inhibit growth of SK BR 3 cells in cell culture by about 20 100 and preferably by about 50 100 at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml. To identify such antibodies the SK BR 3 assay described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 can be performed. According to this assay SK BR 3 cells are grown in a 1 1 mixture of F12 and DMEM medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum glutamine and penicillin streptomycin. The SK BR 3 cells are plated at 20 000 cells in a 35 mm cell culture dish 2 mls 35 mm dish . 0.5 to 30 g ml of the HER2 antibody is added per dish. After six days the number of cells compared to untreated cells are counted using an electronic COULTER cell counter. Those antibodies which inhibit growth of the SK BR 3 cells by about 20 100 or about 50 100 may be selected as growth inhibitory antibodies. See U.S. Pat. No. 5 677 171 for assays for screening for growth inhibitory antibodies such as 4D5 and 3E8.

In order to select for antibodies which induce apoptosis an annexin binding assay using BT474 cells is available. The BT474 cells are cultured and seeded in dishes as discussed in the preceding paragraph. The medium is then removed and replaced with fresh medium alone or medium containing 10 g ml of the monoclonal antibody. Following a three day incubation period monolayers are washed with PBS and detached by trypsinization. Cells are then centrifuged resuspended in Ca binding buffer and aliquoted into tubes as discussed above for the cell death assay. Tubes then receive labeled annexin e.g. annexin V FTIC 1 g ml . Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT CellQuest software Becton Dickinson . Those antibodies which induce statistically significant levels of annexin binding relative to control are selected as apoptosis inducing antibodies. In addition to the annexin binding assay a DNA staining assay using BT474 cells is available. In order to perform this assay BT474 cells which have been treated with the antibody of interest as described in the preceding two paragraphs are incubated with 9 g ml HOECHST 33342 for 2 hr at 37 C. then analyzed on an EPICS ELITE flow cytometer Coulter Corporation using MODFIT LT software Verity Software House . Antibodies which induce a change in the percentage of apoptotic cells which is 2 fold or greater and preferably 3 fold or greater than untreated cells up to 100 apoptotic cells may be selected as pro apoptotic antibodies using this assay. See WO98 17797 for assays for screening for antibodies which induce apoptosis such as 7C2 and 7F3.

To screen for antibodies which bind to an epitope on HER2 bound by an antibody of interest a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed to assess whether the antibody cross blocks binding of an antibody such as 2C4 or pertuzumab to HER2. Alternatively or additionally epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art and or one can study the antibody HER2 structure Franklin et al. 5 317 328 2004 to see what domain s of HER2 is are bound by the antibody.

In one embodiment of a HER2 antibody composition the composition comprises a mixture of a main species pertuzumab antibody and one or more variants thereof. The preferred embodiment herein of a pertuzumab main species antibody is one comprising the variable light and variable heavy amino acid sequences in SEQ ID Nos. 3 and 4 and most preferably comprising a light chain amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID No. 13 and 17 and a heavy chain amino acid sequence selected from SEQ ID No. 14 and 18 including deamidated and or oxidized variants of those sequences . In one embodiment the composition comprises a mixture of the main species pertuzumab antibody and an amino acid sequence variant thereof comprising an amino terminal leader extension. Preferably the amino terminal leader extension is on a light chain of the antibody variant e.g. on one or two light chains of the antibody variant . The main species HER2 antibody or the antibody variant may be an full length antibody or antibody fragment e.g. Fab of F ab 2 fragments but preferably both are full length antibodies. The antibody variant herein may comprise an amino terminal leader extension on any one or more of the heavy or light chains thereof. Preferably the amino terminal leader extension is on one or two light chains of the antibody. The amino terminal leader extension preferably comprises or consists of VHS . Presence of the amino terminal leader extension in the composition can be detected by various analytical techniques including but not limited to N terminal sequence analysis assay for charge heterogeneity for instance cation exchange chromatography or capillary zone electrophoresis mass spectrometry etc. The amount of the antibody variant in the composition generally ranges from an amount that constitutes the detection limit of any assay preferably N terminal sequence analysis used to detect the variant to an amount less than the amount of the main species antibody. Generally about 20 or less e.g. from about 1 to about 15 for instance from 5 to about 15 of the antibody molecules in the composition comprise an amino terminal leader extension. Such percentage amounts are preferably determined using quantitative N terminal sequence analysis or cation exchange analysis preferably using a high resolution weak cation exchange column such as a PROPAC WCX 10 cation exchange column . Aside from the amino terminal leader extension variant further amino acid sequence alterations of the main species antibody and or variant are contemplated including but not limited to an antibody comprising a C terminal lysine residue on one or both heavy chains thereof a deamidated antibody variant etc.

Moreover the main species antibody or variant may further comprise glycosylation variations non limiting examples of which include antibody comprising a G1 or G2 oligosaccharide structure attached to the Fc region thereof antibody comprising a carbohydrate moiety attached to a light chain thereof e.g. one or two carbohydrate moieties such as glucose or galactose attached to one or two light chains of the antibody for instance attached to one or more lysine residues antibody comprising one or two non glycosylated heavy chains or antibody comprising a sialidated oligosaccharide attached to one or two heavy chains thereof etc.

The composition may be recovered from a genetically engineered cell line e.g. a Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cell line expressing the HER2 antibody or may be prepared by peptide synthesis.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent toxin e.g. a small molecule toxin or an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin including fragments and or variants thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin a maytansine U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 a trichothene and CC 1065 are also contemplated herein.

In one preferred embodiment of the invention the antibody is conjugated to one or more maytansine molecules e.g. about 1 to about 10 maytansine molecules per antibody molecule . Maytansine may for example be converted to May SS Me which may be reduced to May SH3 and reacted with modified antibody Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 to generate a maytansinoid antibody immunoconjugate.

Another immunoconjugate of interest comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. 53 3336 3342 1993 and Lode et al. 58 2925 2928 1998 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 714 586 5 712 374 5 264 586 and 5 773 001 expressly incorporated herein by reference.

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated HER2 antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi Pand radioactive isotopes of Lu.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCL active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutareldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as tolyene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 may be used.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis.

Other immunoconjugates are contemplated herein. For example the antibody may be linked to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyoxyalkylenes or copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol. The antibody also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Oslo A. Ed. 1980 .

The antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. 77 4030 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545 and WO97 38731 published Oct. 23 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556.

Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 81 19 1484 1989 .

The patient herein is optionally subjected to a diagnostic test prior to therapy. For example the diagnostic test may evaluate HER e.g. HER2 or EGFR expression including overexpression amplification and or activation including phosphorylation or dimerization .

Generally if a diagnostic test is performed a sample may be obtained from a patient in need of therapy. Where the subject has cancer the sample is generally a tumor sample. In the preferred embodiment the tumor sample is from an ovarian cancer peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer metastatic breast cancer MBC non small cell lung cancer NSCLC prostate cancer or colorectal cancer tumor sample.

It is noted however that various other non malignant therapeutic indications for HER antibodies are described herein. Where the patient is to be treated for those non malignant indications a suitable sample can be obtained from the patient and subjected to a diagnostic assay as described herein.

The biological sample herein may be a fixed sample e.g. a formalin fixed paraffin embedded FFPE sample or a frozen sample.

According to one embodiment of the invention herein the patient selected for therapy has a tumor displaying HER and preferably HER2 activation. In one embodiment the extent of HER or HER2 activation in cancer cells significantly exceeds the level of activation of that receptor in non cancerous cells of the same tissue type. Such excessive activation may result from overexpression of the HER receptor and or greater than normal levels of a HER ligand available for activating the HER receptor in the cancer cells. Such excessive activation may cause and or be caused by the malignant state of a cancer cell. In some embodiments the cancer will be subjected to a diagnostic or prognostic assay to determine whether amplification and or overexpression of a HER receptor is occurring which results in such excessive activation of the HER receptor. Alternatively or additionally the cancer may be subjected to a diagnostic or prognostic assay to determine whether amplification and or overexpression a HER ligand is occurring in the cancer which attributes to excessive activation of the receptor. In a subset of such cancers excessive activation of the receptor may result from an autocrine stimulatory pathway. Various assays for determining HER activation will be described in more detail below.

Tumors samples can be assessed for the presence of HER dimers as indicating HER or HER2 activation. Any method known in the art may be used to detect HER2 dimers such as EGFR HER2 HER2 HER3 in tumors. Several preferred methods are described below. These methods detect noncovalent protein protein interactions or otherwise indicate proximity between proteins of interest.

Immunoaffinity based methods such as immunoprecipitation or ELISA may be used to detect HER dimers. In one embodiment HER2 antibodies are used to immunoprecipitate complexes comprising HER2 from tumor cells and the resulting immunoprecipitant is then probed for the presence of EGFR or HER3 by immunoblotting. In another embodiment EGFR or HER3 antibodies may be used for the immunoprecipitation step and the immunoprecipitant then probed with HER2 antibodies. In a further embodiment HER ligands specific to EGFR HER3 EGFR HER2 complexes or HER2 HER3 complexes may be used to precipitate complexes which are then probed for the presence of HER2. For example ligands may be conjugated to avidin and complexes purified on a biotin column.

In other embodiments such as ELISA or antibody sandwich type assays antibodies to HER2 are immobilized on a solid support contacted with tumor cells or tumor cell lysate washed and then exposed to antibody against EGFR or HER3. Binding of the latter antibody which may be detected directly or by a secondary antibody conjugated to a detectable label indicates the presence of heterodimers. In certain embodiments EGFR or HER3 antibody is immobilized and HER2 antibody is used for the detection step. In other embodiments HER ligands may be used in place of or in combination with HER antibodies.

Chemical or UV cross linking may also be used to covalently join dimers on the surface of living cells. Hunter et al. 320 847 53. Examples of chemical cross linkers include dithiobis succinimidyl propionate DSP and 3 3dithiobis sulphosuccinimidyl propionate DTSSP . In one embodiment cell extracts from chemically cross linked tumor cells are analyzed by SDS PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to EGFR and or HER3. A supershifted band of the appropriate molecular weight most likely represents EGFR HER2 or HER2 HER3 dimers as HER2 is the preferred dimerization partner for EGFR and HER3. This result may be confirmed by subsequent immunoblotting with HER2 antibodies.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer FRET may also be used to detect EGFR HER2 or HER2 HER3 dimers. FRET detects protein conformational changes and protein protein interactions in vivo and in vitro based on the transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore. Selvin 7 730 34 2000 . Energy transfer takes place only if the donor fluorophore is in sufficient proximity to the acceptor fluorophore. In a typical FRET experiment two proteins or two sites on a single protein are labeled with different fluorescent probes. One of the probes the donor probe is excited to a higher energy state by incident light of a specified wavelength. The donor probe then transmits its energy to the second probe the acceptor probe resulting in a reduction in the donor s fluorescence intensity and an increase in the acceptor s fluorescence emission. To measure the extent of energy transfer the donor s intensity in a sample labeled with donor and acceptor probes is compared with its intensity in a sample labeled with donor probe only. Optionally acceptor intensity is compared in donor acceptor and acceptor only samples. Suitable probes are known in the art and include for example membrane permeant dyes such as fluorescein and rhodamine organic dyes such as the cyanine dyes and lanthanide atoms. Selvin supra. Methods and instrumentation for detecting and measuring energy transfer are also known in the art. Selvin supra.

FRET based techniques suitable for detecting and measuring protein protein interactions in individual cells are also known in the art. For example donor photobleaching fluorescence resonance energy transfer pbFRET microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy FLIM may be used to detect the dimerization of cell surface receptors. Selvin supra Gadella Jovin 129 1543 58 1995 . In one embodiment pbFRET is used on cells either in suspension or in situ to detect and measure the formation of EGFR HER2 or HER2 HER3 dimers as described in Nagy et al. 32 120 131 1998 . These techniques measure the reduction in a donor s fluorescence lifetime due to energy transfer. In a particular embodiment a flow cytometric Foerster type FRET technique FCET may be used to investigate EGFR HER2 and HER2 HER3 dimerization as described in Nagy et al. supra and Brockhoff et al. 44 338 48 2001 .

FRET is preferably used in conjunction with standard immunohistochemical labeling techniques. Kenworthy 24 289 96 2001 . For example antibodies conjugated to suitable fluorescent dyes can be used as probes for labeling two different proteins. If the proteins are within proximity of one another the fluorescent dyes act as donors and acceptors for FRET. Energy transfer is detected by standard means. Energy transfer may be detected by flow cytometric means or by digital microscopy systems such as confocal microscopy or wide field fluorescence microscopy coupled to a charge coupled device CCD camera.

In one embodiment of the present invention HER2 antibodies and either EGFR or HER3 antibodies are directly labeled with two different fluorophores for example as described in Nagy et al supra. Tumor cells or tumor cell lysates are contacted with the differentially labeled antibodies which act as donors and acceptors for FRET in the presence of EGFR HER2 or HER2 HER3 dimers. Alternatively unlabeled antibodies against HER2 and either EGFR or HER3 are used along with differentially labeled secondary antibodies that serve as donors and acceptors. See for example Brockhoff et al. supra. Energy transfer is detected and the presence of dimers is determined if the labels are found to be in close proximity.

In other embodiments HER receptor ligands that are specific for HER2 and either HER1 or HER3 are fluorescently labeled and used for FRET studies.

In still other embodiments of the present invention the presence of dimers on the surface of tumor cells is demonstrated by co localization of HER2 with either EGFR or HER3 using standard direct or indirect immunofluorescence techniques and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Alternatively laser scanning imaging LSI is used to detect antibody binding and co localization of HER2 with either EGFR or HER3 in a high throughput format such as a microwell plate as described in Zuck et al 96 11122 27 1999 .

In further embodiments the presence of EGFR HER2 and or HER2 HER3 dimers is determined by identifying enzymatic activity that is dependent upon the proximity of the dimer components. A HER2 antibody is conjugated with one enzyme and an EGFR or HER3 antibody is conjugated with a second enzyme. A first substrate for the first enzyme is added and the reaction produces a second substrate for the second enzyme. This leads to a reaction with another molecule to produce a detectable compound such as a dye. The presence of another chemical breaks down the second substrate so that reaction with the second enzyme is prevented unless the first and second enzymes and thus the two antibodies are in close proximity. In a particular embodiment tumor cells or cell lysates are contacted with a HER2 antibody that is conjugated with glucose oxidase and a HER3 or HER1 antibody that is conjugated with horse radish peroxidase. Glucose is added to the reaction along with a dye precursor such as DAB and catalase. The presence of dimers is determined by the development of color upon staining for DAB.

Dimers may also be detected using methods based on the eTag assay system Aclara Bio Sciences Mountain View Calif. as described for example in U.S. Patent Application 2001 0049105 published Dec. 6 2001 both of which are expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety. An eTag or electrophoretic tag comprises a detectable reporter moiety such as a fluorescent group. It may also comprise a mobility modifier which consists essentially of a moiety having a unique electrophoretic mobility. These moieties allow for separation and detection of the eTag from a complex mixture under defined electrophoretic conditions such as capillary electrophoresis CE . The portion of the eTag containing the reporter moiety and optionally the mobility modifier is linked to a first target binding moiety by a cleavable linking group to produce a first binding compound. The first target binding moiety specifically recognizes a particular first target such as a nucleic acid or protein. The first target binding moiety is not limited in any way and may be for example a polynucleotide or a polypeptide. Preferably the first target binding moiety is an antibody or antibody fragment. Alternatively the first target binding moiety may be a HER receptor ligand or binding competent fragment thereof.

The linking group preferably comprises a cleavable moiety such as an enzyme substrate or any chemical bond that may be cleaved under defined conditions. When the first target binding moiety binds to its target the cleaving agent is introduced and or activated and the linking group is cleaved thus releasing the portion of the eTag containing the reporter moiety and mobility modifier. Thus the presence of a free eTag indicates the binding of the target binding moiety to its target.

Preferably a second binding compound comprises the cleaving agent and a second target binding moiety that specifically recognizes a second target. The second target binding moiety is also not limited in any way and may be for example an antibody or antibody fragment or a HER receptor ligand or binding competent ligand fragment. The cleaving agent is such that it will only cleave the linking group in the first binding compound if the first binding compound and the second binding compound are in close proximity.

In an embodiment of the present invention a first binding compound comprises an eTag in which an antibody to HER2 serves as the first target binding moiety. A second binding compound comprises an antibody to EGFR or HER3 joined to a cleaving agent capable of cleaving the linking group of the eTag . Preferably the cleaving agent must be activated in order to be able to cleave the linking group. Tumor cells or tumor cell lysates are contacted with the eTag which binds to HER2 and with the modified EGFR or HER3 antibody which binds to EGFR or HER3 on the cell surface. Unbound binding compound is preferable removed and the cleaving agent is activated if necessary. If EGFR HER2 or HER2 HER3 dimers are present the cleaving agent will cleave the linking group and release the eTag due to the proximity of the cleaving agent to the linking group. Free eTag may then be detected by any method known in the art such as capillary electrophoresis.

In one embodiment the cleaving agent is an activatable chemical species that acts on the linking group. For example the cleaving agent may be activated by exposing the sample to light.

In another embodiment the eTag is constructed using an antibody to EGFR or HER3 as the first target binding moiety and the second binding compound is constructed from an antibody to HER2.

In yet another embodiment the HER dimer is detected using an antibody or other reagent which specifically or preferentially binds to the dimer as compared to binding thereof to either HER receptor in the dimer.

Immunoprecipitation with EGFR HER2 or HER3 antibody as discussed in the previous section may optionally be followed by a functional assay for dimers as an alternative or supplement to immunoblotting. In one embodiment immunoprecipitation with HER3 antibody is followed by an assay for receptor tyrosine kinase activity in the immunoprecipitant. Because HER3 does not have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity the presence of tyrosine kinase activity in the immunoprecipitant indicates that HER3 is most likely associated with HER2. Graus Porta et al. 16 1647 55 1997 Klapper et al. 96 4995 5000 1999 . This result may be confirmed by immunoblotting with HER2 antibodies. In another embodiment immunoprecipitation with HER2 antibody is followed by an assay for EGFR receptor tyrosine kinase activity. In this assay the immunoprecipitant is contacted with radioactive ATP and a peptide substrate that mimics the in vivo site of transphosphorylation of HER2 by EGFR. Phosphorylation of the peptide indicates co immunoprecipitation and thus dimerization of EGFR with HER2. Receptor tyrosine kinase activity assays are well known in the art and include assays that detect phosphorylation of target substrates for example by phosphotyrosine antibody and activation of cognate signal transduction pathways such as the MAPK pathway.

Phosphorylation of HER receptor may be assessed by immunoprecipitation of one or more HER receptors such as HER2 receptor and Western blot analysis. For example positivity is determined by the presence of a phospho HER2 band on the gel using an anti phosphotyrosine antibody to detect phosphorylated tyrosine residue s in the immunoprecipitated HER receptor s . Anti phosphotyrosine antibodies are commercially available from PanVera Madison Wis. a subsidiary of Invitrogen Chemicon International Inc. Temecula Calif. or Upstate Biotechnology Lake Placid N.Y. . Negativity is determined by the absence of the band.

In another embodiment phosphorylation of HER2 HER2 receptor is assessed by immunohistochemistry using a phospho specific HER2 antibody clone PN2A Thor et al. 18 18 3230 3239 2000 .

Other methods for detecting phosphorylation of HER receptor s include but are not limited to KIRA ELISA U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 766 863 5 891 650 5 914 237 6 025 145 and 6 287 784 mass spectrometry comparing size of phosphorylated and non phosphorylated HER2 and e tag proximity assay with both a HER e.g. HER2 antibody and phospho specific or phospho tyrosine specific antibody e.g. using the eTag assay kit available from Aclara BioSciences Mountain View Calif. . Details of the eTag assay are described hereinabove.

One may also use phospho specific antibodies in cellular array to detect phosphorylation status in a cellular sample of signal transduction protein US2003 0190689 .

In one embodiment a gene expression analyses can serve as a surrogate for measuring HER phosphorylation or activation directly. This is particularly useful where the sample is a fixed sample e.g. parrafin embedded formalin fixed tumor sample where HER phosphorylation may be difficult to reliably quantify. According to this method expression of two or more HER receptors and one or more HER ligand in a sample is evaluated wherein expression of the two or more HER receptors and one or more HER ligand indicates positive HER phosphorylation or activation in the sample. In one embodiment of this method expression of betacellulin and or amphiregulin in the sample can be measured wherein betacellulin and or amphiregulin expression indicates positive HER phosphorylation or activation in the sample.

According to this method a sample from the patient is tested for expression of two or more HER receptors preferably selected from EGFR HER2 and HER3 and one or more HER ligands preferably selected from betacellulin amphiregulin epiregulin and TGF most preferably betacellulin or amphiregulin . For example the two or more HER receptors may be EGFR and HER2 or HER2 and HER3. Preferably expression of HER2 and EGFR or HER3 as well as betacellulin or amphiregulin is determined. The sample may be tested for expression of betacellulin or amphiregulin alone or in combination with testing for expression of two or more HER receptors. Positive expression of the identified gene s indicates the patient is a candidate for therapy with a HER antibody such as pertuzumab. Moreover positive expression of the gene s indicates the patient is more likely to respond favorably to therapy with the HER antibody than a patient who does not have such positive expression.

Various methods for determining expression of mRNA or protein include but are not limited to gene expression profiling polymerase chain reaction PCR including quantitative real time PCR qRT PCR microarray analysis serial analysis of gene expression SAGE MassARRAY Gene Expression Analysis by Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing MPSS proteomics immunohistochemistry IHC etc. Preferably mRNA is quantified. Such mRNA analysis is preferably performed using the technique of polymerase chain reaction PCR or by microarray analysis. Where PCR is employed a preferred form of PCR is quantitative real time PCR qRT PCR . In one embodiment expression of one or more of the above noted genes is deemed positive expression if it is at the median or above e.g. compared to other samples of the same tumor type. The median expression level can be determined essentially contemporaneously with measuring gene expression or may have been determined previously.

Various exemplary methods for determining gene expression The steps of a representative protocol for profiling gene expression using fixed paraffin embedded tissues as the RNA source including mRNA isolation purification primer extension and amplification are given in various published journal articles for example Godfrey et al. 2 84 91 2000 Specht et al. 158 419 29 2001 . Briefly a representative process starts with cutting about 10 microgram thick sections of paraffin embedded tumor tissue samples. The RNA is then extracted and protein and DNA are removed. After analysis of the RNA concentration RNA repair and or amplification steps may be included if necessary and RNA is reverse transcribed using gene specific promoters followed by PCR. Finally the data are analyzed to identify the best treatment option s available to the patient on the basis of the characteristic gene expression pattern identified in the tumor sample examined.

To determine HER expression or amplification in the cancer various diagnostic prognostic assays are available. In one embodiment HER overexpression may be analyzed by IHC e.g. using the HERCEPTEST Dako . Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a HER2 protein staining intensity criteria as follows 

Score 1 a faint barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10 of the tumor cells. The cells are only stained in part of their membrane.

Score 2 a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Score 3 a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Those tumors with 0 or 1 scores for HER2 overexpression assessment may be characterized as not overexpressing HER2 whereas those tumors with 2 or 3 scores may be characterized as overexpressing HER2.

Tumors overexpressing HER2 may be rated by immunohistochemical scores corresponding to the number of copies of HER2 molecules expressed per cell and can been determined biochemically 

Overexpression of HER2 at the 3 level which leads to ligand independent activation of the tyrosine kinase Hudziak et al. 84 7159 7163 1987 occurs in approximately 30 of breast cancers and in these patients relapse free survival and overall survival are diminished Slamon et al. 244 707 712 1989 Slamon et al. 235 177 182 1987 .

Alternatively or additionally FISH assays such as the INFORM sold by Ventana Ariz. or PATHVISION Vysis Ill. may be carried out on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent if any of HER2 amplification in the tumor.

In one embodiment the cancer will be one which expresses and may overexpress EGFR such expression may be evaluated as for the methods for evaluating HER2 expression as noted above.

HER receptor or HER ligand overexpression or amplification may also be evaluated using an in vivo diagnostic assay e.g. by administering a molecule such as an antibody which binds the molecule to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label.

Therapeutic formulations of the antibodies used in accordance with the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing an antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG . Lyophilized antibody formulations are described in WO 97 04801 expressly incorporated herein by reference.

The preferred pertuzumab formulation for therapeutic use comprises 30 mg mL pertuzumab in 20 mM histidine acetate 120 mM sucrose 0.02 polysorbate 20 at pH 6.0. An alternate pertuzumab formulation comprises 25 mg mL pertuzumab 10 mM histidine HCl buffer 240 mM sucrose 0.02 polysorbate 20 pH 6.0.

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Various drugs which can be combined with the HER antibody are described in the method of treatment section below. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and y ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid.

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Examples of various cancers that can be treated with a fixed dose of a HER antibody are listed in the definition section above. Preferred cancer indications include ovarian cancer peritoneal cancer fallopian tube cancer breast cancer including metastatic breast cancer MBC lung cancer including non small cell lung cancer NSCLC prostate cancer colorectal cancer and or cancer which displays HER expression amplification and or activation. In one embodiment the cancer which is treated is chemotherapy resistant cancer or platinum resistant cancer. Administration of fixed dose s of the antibody will result in an improvement in the signs or symptoms of cancer.

Aside from cancer fixed dose s of the HER antibodies as disclosed herein may be used to treat various non malignant diseases or disorders. Such non malignant diseases or disorders include autoimmune disease e.g. psoriasis see definition above endometriosis scleroderma restenosis polyps such as colon polyps nasal polyps or gastrointestinal polyps fibroadenoma respiratory disease see definition above cholecystitis neurofibromatosis polycystic kidney disease inflammatory diseases skin disorders including psoriasis and dermatitis vascular disease see definition above conditions involving abnormal proliferation of vascular epithelial cells gastrointestinal ulcers Menetrier s disease secreting adenomas or protein loss syndrome renal disorders angiogenic disorders ocular disease such as age related macular degeneration presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome retinal neovascularization from proliferative diabetic retinopathy retinal vascularization diabetic retinopathy or age related macular degeneration bone associated pathologies such as osteoarthritis rickets and osteoporosis damage following a cerebral ischemic event fibrotic or edemia diseases such as hepatic cirrhosis lung fibrosis carcoidosis throiditis hyperviscosity syndrome systemic Osler Weber Rendu disease chronic occlusive pulmonary disease or edema following burns trauma radiation stroke hypoxia or ischemia hypersensitivity reaction of the skin diabetic retinopathy and diabetic nephropathy Guillain Barre syndrome graft versus host disease or transplant rejection Paget s disease bone or joint inflammation photoaging e.g. caused by UV radiation of human skin benign prostatic hypertrophy certain microbial infections including microbial pathogens selected from adenovirus hantaviruses spp. and thrombus caused by platelet aggregation reproductive conditions such as endometriosis ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome preeclampsia dysfunctional uterine bleeding or menometrorrhagia synovitis atheroma acute and chronic nephropathies including proliferative glomerulonephritis and diabetes induced renal disease eczema hypertrophic scar formation endotoxic shock and fungal infection familial adenomatosis polyposis neurodedenerative diseases e.g. Alzheimer s disease AIDS related dementia Parkinson s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis retinitis pigmentosa spinal muscular atrophy and cerebellar degeneration myelodysplastic syndromes aplastic anemia ischemic injury fibrosis of the lung kidney or liver T cell mediated hypersensitivity disease infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis urinary obstructive syndrome psoriatic arthritis and Hasimoto s thyroiditis. Preferred non malignant indications for therapy herein include psoriasis endometriosis scleroderma vascular disease e.g. restenosis artherosclerosis coronary artery disease or hypertension colon polyps fibroadenoma or respiratory disease e.g. asthma chronic bronchitis bronchieactasis or cystic fibrosis .

The HER antibody is administered to a human patient in accord with known methods such as intravenous administration e.g. as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by intramuscular intraperitoneal intracerobrospinal subcutaneous intra articular intrasynovial intrathecal oral topical or inhalation routes. Intravenous administration of the antibody is preferred.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the fixed dose of HER antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The fixed dose is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Preferably the fixed dose is in the range from about 20 mg to about 2000 mg of the HER antibody. For example the fixed dose may be approximately 420 mg approximately 525 mg approximately 840 mg or approximately 1050 mg of the HER antibody.

Where a series of fixed doses are administered these may for example be administered approximately every week approximately every 2 weeks approximately every 3 weeks or approximately every 4 weeks but preferably approximately every 3 weeks. The fixed doses may for example continue to be administered until disease progression adverse event or other time as determined by the physician. For example from about two three or four up to about 17 or more fixed doses may be administered.

In one embodiment one or more loading dose s of the antibody are administered followed by one or more maintenance dose s of the antibody. In another embodiment a plurality of the same fixed dose are administered to the patient.

According to one preferred embodiment of the invention a fixed dose of HER antibody e.g. pertuzumab of approximately 840 mg loading dose is administered followed by one or more doses of approximately 420 mg maintenance dose s of the antibody. The maintenance doses are preferably administered about every 3 weeks for a total of at least two doses up to 17 or more doses.

According to another preferred embodiment of the invention one or more fixed dose s of approximately 1050 mg of the HER antibody e.g. pertzumab are administered for example every 3 weeks. According to this embodiment one two or more of the fixed doses are administered e.g. for up to one year 17 cycles and longer as desired.

In another embodiment a fixed dose of approximately 1050 mg of HER2 antibody e.g. pertuzumab is administered as a loading dose followed by one or more maintenance dose s of approximately 525 mg of the antibody. About one two or more maintenance doses may be administered to the patient every 3 weeks according to this embodiment.

Thus the invention provides a method of treating cancer in a human patient comprising administering at least one fixed dose of pertuzumab to the patient wherein the fixed dose is approximately 420 mg approximately 525 mg approximately 840 mg or approximately 1050 mg of pertuzumab.

Where the disease is cancer the patient is preferably treated with a combination of the HER antibody and one or more chemotherapeutic agent s . Preferably at least one of the chemotherapeutic agents is an antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine. The combined administration includes coadministration or concurrent administration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. Thus the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent may be administered prior to or following administration of the HER antibody. In this embodiment the timing between at least one administration of the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent and at least one administration of the HER antibody is preferably approximately 1 month or less and most preferably approximately 2 weeks or less. Alternatively the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent and the HER antibody are administered concurrently to the patient in a single formulation or separate formulations. Treatment with the combination of the chemotherapeutic agent e.g. antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent such as gemcitabine and the HER antibody e.g. pertuzumab may result in a synergistic or greater than additive therapeutic benefit to the patient.

An antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent if administered is usually administered at dosages known therefor or optionally lowered due to combined action of the drugs or negative side effects attributable to administration of the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Where the antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent is gemcitabine preferably it is administered at a dose between about 600 mg m to 1250 mg m2 for example approximately 1000 mg m 2 for instance on days 1 and 8 of a 3 week cycle.

Aside from the HER antibody and antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent other therapeutic regimens may be combined therewith. For example a second third fourth etc chemotherapeutic agent s may be administered wherein the second chemotherapeutic agent is either another different antimetabolite chemotherapeutic agent or a chemotherapeutic agent that is not an antimetabolite. For example the second chemotherapeutic agent may be a taxane such as paclitaxel or docetaxel capecitabine or platinum based chemotherapeutic agent such as carboplatin cisplatin or oxaliplatin anthracycline such as doxorubicin including liposomal doxorubicin topotecan pemetrexed vinca alkaloid such as vinorelbine and TLK 286. Cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents may be administered.

Other therapeutic agents that may be combined with the HER antibody include any one or more of a second different HER antibody for example a growth inhibitory HER2 antibody such as trastuzumab or a HER2 antibody which induces apoptosis of a HER2 overexpressing cell such as 7C2 7F3 or humanized variants thereof an antibody directed against a different tumor associated antigen such as EGFR HER3 HER4 anti hormonal compound e.g. an anti estrogen compound such as tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor a cardioprotectant to prevent or reduce any myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy a cytokine an EGFR targeted drug such as TARCEVAO IRESSA or Cetuximab an anti angiogenic agent especially Bevacizumab sold by Genentech under the trademark AVASTIN a tyrosine kinase inhibitor a COX inhibitor for instance a COX 1 or COX 2 inhibitor non steroidal anti inflammatory drug Celecoxib CELEBREX farnesyl transferase inhibitor for example Tipifarnib ZARNESTRA R115777 available from Johnson and Johnson or Lonafarnib SCH66336 available from Schering Plough antibody that binds oncofetal protein CA 125 such as Oregovomab MoAb B43.13 HER2 vaccine such as HER2 AutoVac vaccine from Pharmexia or APC8024 protein vaccine from Dendreon or HER2 peptide vaccine from GSK Corixa another HER targeting therapy e.g. trastuzumab cetuximab gefitinib erlotinib C11033 GW2016 etc Raf and or ras inhibitor see for example WO 2003 86467 doxorubicin HCl liposome injection DOXIL topoisomerase I inhibitor such as topotecan taxane HER2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as lapatinib GW572016 TLK286 TELCYTA EMD 7200 a medicament that treats nausea such as a serotonin antagonist steroid or benzodiazepine a medicament that prevents or treats skin rash or standard acne therapies including topical or oral antibiotic a body temperature reducing medicament such as acetaminophen diphenhydramine or meperidine hematopoietic growth factor etc.

Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the agent and HER antibody.

In addition to the above therapeutic regimes the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and or radiation therapy.

Preferably the antibody administered is a naked antibody. However the antibody administered may be conjugated with a cytotoxic agent. Preferably the immunoconjugate and or antigen to which it is bound is are internalized by the cell resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the cancer cell to which it binds. In a preferred embodiment the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the cancer cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include maytansinoids calicheamicins ribonucleases and DNA endonucleases.

Aside from administration of the antibody protein to the patient the present application contemplates administration of an antibody or protein inhibitor by gene therapy. See for example WO96 07321 published Mar. 14 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.

There are two major approaches to getting the nucleic acid optionally contained in a vector into the patient s cells in vivo and ex vivo. For in vivo delivery the nucleic acid is injected directly into the patient usually at the site where the antibody is required. For ex vivo treatment the patient s cells are removed the nucleic acid is introduced into these isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the patient either directly or for example encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 and 5 283 187 . There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes electroporation microinjection cell fusion DEAE dextran the calcium phosphate precipitation method etc. A commonly used vector for ex vivo delivery of the gene is a retrovirus.

The currently preferred in vivo nucleic acid transfer techniques include transfection with viral vectors such as adenovirus Herpes simplex I virus or adeno associated virus and lipid based systems useful lipids for lipid mediated transfer of the gene are DOTMA DOPE and DC Chol for example . In some situations it is desirable to provide the nucleic acid source with an agent that targets the target cells such as an antibody specific for a cell surface membrane protein or the target cell a ligand for a receptor on the target cell etc. Where liposomes are employed proteins which bind to a cell surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be used for targeting and or to facilitate uptake e.g. capsid proteins or fragments thereof tropic for a particular cell type antibodies for proteins which undergo internalization in cycling and proteins that target intracellular localization and enhance intracellular half life. The technique of receptor mediated endocytosis is described for example by Wu et al. 262 4429 4432 1987 and Wagner et al. 87 3410 3414 1990 . For review of the currently known gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 . See also WO 93 25673 and the references cited therein.

In another embodiment of the invention an article of manufacture containing materials useful for the treatment of cancer or the other disorders described above is provided. The article of manufacture comprises a vial with a fixed dose of the HER antibody contained therein and optionally a package insert. The vial may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic and may be sealed by a stopper pierceable by a syringe.

The present example evaluates the population pharmacokinetic PK and predictive covariates for the HER antibody pertuzumab and examined the variability of steady state trough serum concentrations after fixed body weight based or BSA based dosing methods. Pertuzumab was administered by IV infusion q3 week either as a weight based dose 0.5 15 mg kg or a fixed dose 420 mg or 1050 mg . Pertuzumab serum concentration data from one phase Ia and two phase II trials ovarian and breast comprising 153 patients and 1458 concentration time points were pooled for this analysis using NONMEM with the first order conditional estimation with Interaction FOCE interaction method. A linear 2 compartment model best described the data. Body weight serum albumin and serum alkaline phosphatase were significant covariates affecting clearance CL and body surface area BSA was a significant variable affecting distribution volume at central compartment Vc . In the final model CL and Vc were 0.214 L day and 2.74 L respectively. Weight only explained 8.3 of inter patient variability for CL. Evaluation of the final population PK model using a posterior predictive check showed good performance. Compared to fixed dosing weight and BSA based dosing only reduced the population variability of steady state trough concentrations by 6.2 and 5.8 respectively in 1000 simulated subjects bootstrapped from the original data set using the final model. Simulations also showed that the percentages of subjects with predicted steady state trough concentrations below a target of 20 mcg mL were similar following fixed weight or BSA based dosing. It was concluded that although humanized antibodies are typically dosed by weight the analyses in this example demonstrate the desirability of administering the HER antibody pertuzumab using a fixed dose to treat cancer.

All three studies used in this analysis were approved by the appropriate ethics committees of the participating centers. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Study 1 was a Phase Ia open label multicenter dose escalation study to evaluate the safety tolerability and pharmacokinetic profiles of pertuzumab administered intravenously as a single agent to subjects with advanced solid malignancies. These patients received a dose of pertuzumab administered by the IV route every 3 weeks as a 90 minute IV infusion on the 1cycle then as 30 minute infusion in subsequent cycles. Doses were escalated 0.5 2 5 10 and 15 mg kg in cohorts of 3 or 6 subjects until the maximum tolerated dose MTD was defined or the highest dose level was reached. During the first cycle of treatment serum samples for determination of pertuzumab concentrations were collected at serial time points prior to the dose at the end of the IV infusion at 1.5 4 and 9 hours and on days 2 5 8 and 15. During the second treatment cycle serum samples for determination of pertuzumab concentrations were collected prior to the dose 29 minutes following the start of the IV infusion and on day 8.

Study 2 was a phase II open label single arm multicenter trial to evaluate the overall efficacy safety tolerability and the effect of tumor based HER2 activation on the efficacy of pertuzumab in patients with advanced ovarian cancer in which their disease was refractory to or had recurred following prior chemotherapy. These women received IV infusions of pertuzumab administered as a single agent over a 90 minute period during the 1cycle of treatment at a fixed dose of 840 mg followed by a 420 mg maintenance dose delivered as a 30 minute infusion every 3 weeks during subsequent treatment cycles. During the first and second treatment cycle serum samples for determination of pertuzumab concentrations were collected prior to the dose 15 minutes following the end of the infusion and at days 8 and 15. Additional serum samples for determination of pertuzumab concentrations were collected prior to the dose and 15 minutes after the end of the IV infusion during subsequent treatment cycles.

Study 3 was a Phase II open label single arm multicenter randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different doses of pertuzumab administered as a single agent in patients with metastatic breast cancer with low expression of HER2. In first dose cohort patients received pertuzumab as an IV infusion administered over a 90 minute period as a 840 mg loading dose on the 1cycle followed by a maintenance dose of 420 mg given every 3 weeks as a 30 minute IV infusion during subsequent treatment cycles. In the second dose cohort the patients received an IV infusion of pertuzumab as a 1050 mg dose over a 90 minute period on the 1cycle and as a 1050 mg dose as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks during subsequent treatment cycles. In study 3 serum samples for determination of pertuzumab concentrations were collected prior to the dose 15 minutes following the end of infusion and on days 8 and 15 during the first two treatment cycles. Additional serum samples for determination of pertuzumab concentrations were collected prior to the dose and 15 minutes after the end of infusion during subsequent treatment cycles.

Pertuzumab serum concentrations were determined by a validated receptor binding enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA . The assay used p185HER2 extracellular domain to capture pertuzumab from serum samples. Bound pertuzumab was detected with mouse anti human Fc horseradish peroxidase HRP Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. and tetramethyl benzidine TMB KPL Inc. was used as the substrate for color development to quantify serum pertuzumab. The assay has a minimum quantifiable concentration of 0.25 mcg mL for pertuzumab in human serum.

Population non linear mixed effect modeling was performed using NONMEM Boeckmann and Beal NONMEM User Guide. San Francisco NONMEM Project Group University of California San Francisco 1994 software Version V Level 1.0 with NM TRAN and PREDPP and the Compaq Visual Fortran compiler Version 6.5 . Two different basic structural models a one and two compartmental linear PK model with IV infusion were fit to serum pertuzumab concentration time data. The first order conditional estimation FOCE method with interaction was used throughout the model building procedure. An exponential error model was used to describe the interindividual variability for the PK parameters exp 1 A multiplicative covariate regression model was implemented as follows 

The relationships between structural model based Bayesian estimates of the PK parameters and individual covariates were explored graphically. Based on preliminary exploratory analyses the effect of each covariate on PK parameters was tested. Initially the influence of covariates on individual PK parameters i.e. clearance and volume of the central compartment was examined. Then a full covariate model for the individual PK parameters was constructed by incorporating the significant covariates into the model. A backward elimination process was used to determine the final covariate model for each individual PK parameter by retaining only the significant covariates in the model. When highly correlated covariates had a similar pharmacological meaning such as weight and BSA only the most significant factor was retained in the model. This final covariate model obtained for each PK parameter was then combined to form a new full model and the final population PK model was elaborated using a backward elimination process.

Comparison of alternative structural models and construction of the covariate model was based on the typical goodness of fit diagnostic plots and likelihood ratio test. When comparing alternative hierarchical models the differences in the value of the objective function is approximately chi square distributed with n degree of freedom n is the difference in the number or parameters between the full and the reduced model . This approximation has been shown to be reliable for the FOCE INTERACTION estimation method Wahlby et al. 28 231 52 2001 . To discriminate two hierarchical models a difference in an objective function of greater than 7.9 I degree of freedom which corresponds to a significance level of p

The fraction of inter individual variance variance explained by the covariates in the regression model for a given PK parameters e.g. CL was computed as follows 

Where and represented inter individual variance of clearance in based and final PK model respectively.

The model evaluation in this study utilized a bootstrap resampling technique to evaluate the stability of the final model and estimate the confidence interval of parameters. This model evaluation technique consists of first creating data sets using the bootstrap option in the software package Wings for NONMEM N Holford Version 404 June 2003 Auckland New Zealand then obtaining parameter estimates for each of the replicate data sets. The results from 1000 successful runs were obtained and the mean and and 97.5percentiles denoting the 95 confidence interval for the population parameters were determined and compared with the estimates of the original data.

In addition a posterior predictive model checks were used to evaluate the ability of the final model to describe the observed data Yano et al. 28 171 92 2001 Gelman and Meng Model checking and model improvement. In Gilks W R Richardson S Spiegelhalter D J eds. . Boca Raton Chapman HalVCRC 189 202 1996 Gelman et al. . Boca Raton Chapman Hall CRC 2004 . In these analyses the 2.5 5 10 25 50 median 75 90 and 95percentiles of the observed data were computed and selected as the test statistics for the posterior predictive model check. The final population PK model including final fixed and random effect parameters was used to simulate 1000 replicates of the observed data set and test statistics were computed from each of those simulated dataset. The posterior predictive distribution of test statistics from the simulated dataset was then compared with the observed test statistics and the p value p can be estimated by calculating the proportion of cases in which test statistics from the simulated data set exceed the realized value of observed test statistics according to the following equation Gelman and Meng 1996 supra .

Where I . is the indicator function which takes the value 1 when its argument is true and 0 otherwise. T y is a realized value of the observed test statistics because it is realized by the observed data y. T y is the test statistics from a simulated data set i range from 1 to 1000 Gelman and Meng 1996 supra .

In addition the 2.5 5 95 and 97.5quantiles of the simulated data were calculated for each time points for individual patients. The numbers of observed data that fell within the boundaries of the 2.5and 95.5quantiles 95 interval 5and 95quantiles 90 interval of the pooled simulated data were determined.

The final population PK model was used to determine the steady state trough concentrations and exposure after fixed BSA and weight based dosing. Serum concentration time profiles and clearance of pertuzumab for 1000 subjects were simulated for a fixed BSA based or weight based dosing regimen using the final model with a dataset obtained by bootstrapping with replacement the original PK dataset. All simulated subjects received a 840 mg 12.2 mg kg or 485 mg m2 iv infusion over 90 min on Day 0 then a 420 mg 6.1 mg kg or 242.5 mg m iv infusion over 30 min on Days 21 42 and 63. Steady state trough concentrations obtained on Day 84 Css after different dosing regimens were then assessed. In addition the percent of subjects with steady state trough concentrations below a target concentration 20 mcg ml after a fixed BSA based or weight based dose were calculated. Simulated clearance values were used to determine the steady state average exposure AUCss according to the following equation 

Demographic data. The demographic characteristics of the patients included in this PK analysis are listed in Table 2.

A total of 1458 pertuzumab serum concentration time points were collected from 153 patients in the three studies. Of the total 18 patients were from the phase Ia trial 60 from the phase II ovarian cancer trial and 75 from the phase II breast cancer trial. Thus the majority 94.8 of the patients in this analysis were female and accounted for 1110 76 of the serum pertuzumab concentration data. All subjects had low HER2 expression tumor confirmed by FISH fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and had good physical functional status as indicated by an ECOG Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of either 0 or 1. The number of patients with missing covariates was very low 4.6 for both height and BSA and the missing covariates were imputed with the median values. In 384 20.8 serum pertuzumab concentration samples with only a documented sampling date the sampling time was imputed to occur at 12 noon. A sensitivity analysis conducted to assess the effects of these imputed times on the population parameters estimates in the model revealed no significant influence.

Population PK analysis. A two compartment model described the data better than one compartment model based on the change of objective function 736.2 and diagnostic plots. A representative pertuzumab serum concentration time profile fit to a one and two compartment model are illustrated in . The inter individual variability term of K12 was removed from two compartmental models since the removal of this term did not result in a statistically significant increase 

The effect of the presence of a covariance term among and was next assessed. Incorporation of a covariance terms among and improved the fit 23.2 df 3 . However the covariance terms were found to be poorly estimated CV 100 have a small estimated correlation r 0.37 r 0.27 r 0.42 and have little influence on parameter estimations data not shown . Therefore the covariance terms were not retained for covariate effect model building. In an exploratory analysis using the final base model no apparent relationships between potential covariates and were identified. Therefore covariate effect on was not examined during the development of the final model with covariates.

For the final model with covariates predicted versus observed pertuzumab serum concentrations and weighted residuals versus predicted serum concentration plots are shown in . In the final model serum albumin ALB body weight BW and serum alkaline phosphatase ALKP were the most significant covariates explaining interindividual variability for pertuzumab clearance CL . BSA was the most significant covariate explaining interindividual variability of pertuzumab central compartment volume of distribution Vc . Incorporation of covariance terms among and improved the fit 14.0 df 3 . However the estimated correlation was not large r 0.45 r 0.28 r 0.39 and the parameter estimates were not influenced data not shown . Hence the covariance terms were not included in the final model. The final model was illustrated as follows 

The CL of serum pertuzumab in the analysis population was estimated to be 0.214 L day and the Vc was 2.74 L. The Kand Kwere 0.203 and 0.258 days respectively. Interindividual variability for CL and Vc in the final model calculated as the square root of interindividual variance and expressed as CV are 31.1 and 16.2 respectively compared to 38.0 and 20.8 for the base model without covariates. The covariate effect of ALB WT and ALKP in the final model therefore explained about 33 of the interindividual variance for CL. However weight alone explained only 8.3 of inter patient variability for CL. The covariate effect of BSA explained about 39 of interindividual variance for Vc in the final model. The dependency of CL on WT and Vc on BSA with the base model is accounted for in the final model as shown in . The estimated t and t were 1.4 and 17.2 days respectively.

Model Evaluation. From the original dataset 1000 successful bootstrap runs were obtained and compared to the original observed data. Mean population PK estimates obtained from the bootstrap procedure were similar to the parameter estimates of the original dataset Table 3 indicating that the developed model was stable. The 95 confidence intervals for the fixed effect parameters were narrow which indicated good precision.

A posterior predictive model check was used to evaluate the ability of the final model to describe the observed data. The final population pharmacokinetic model including final fixed and random effect parameters was used to simulate 1000 replicates. The test statistics were then computed for each of those 1000 simulated dataset. display histograms of the 1000 simulated values of selected test statistics with the realized value of the observed test statistics indicated by vertical line. The posterior predictive distributions were close to the observed values with the estimated p values greater than 0.05 for each test statistics. In addition the percents of observed pertuzumab concentrations within 90 and 95 quantile range of the pooled simulated data were 89.3 and 94.7 respectively. These results suggested that the model was able to describe and predict the data reasonably well.

Predicted pertuzumab steady state trough serum concentrations on day 84 C were estimated for 1000 simulated subjects bootstrapped from the original PK dataset and the final model using a fixed weight based or BSA based dose according to the dose schedules outlined in the methods section. These data showed that with weight based and BSA based dosing population variability of Cdecreased by 6.17 and 5.76 respectively when compared to fixed dosing and Table 4 .

The percentage of subjects with Cbelow a target serum concentration of 20 mcg ml were similar with values of 8.3 8.7 and 8.3 for fixed weight based or BSA based dosing respectively Table 4 . Similar results were obtained from the analysis of pertuzumab serum steady state AUC for 1000 simulated subjects and weight and BSA based dosing only reduced the population variability by 2.2 and 4.2 respectively when compared to fixed dosing. The same simulated dataset was used to determine Cafter a fixed dose weight and BSA based dose for populations with extreme weight i.e. WT 10and 90percentile . Median pertuzumab Cfor population with WT less than or equal to 10percentile were 72.3 range 8.7 to 166.5 52.8 range 6.8 to 125.7 and 63.2 range 7.8 to 150.1 mcg ml for a fixed dose weight and BSA based dose respectively. The percentage of subjects in population with Cbelow a target serum concentration of 20 mcg ml were 5.4 12.6 and 9.0 for fixed weight based and BSA based dosing respectively. Median pertuzumab Cfor population with WT greater than or equal to 90percentile were 42.1 range 7.0 to 119.8 62.8 range 14.4 to 167.3 and 52.9 range 10.2 to 133.3 mcg ml for a fixed dose weight and BSA based dose respectively. The percentages of subjects in this population with Cbelow a target serum concentration of 20 mcg ml were similar with values of 7.4 2.8 and 5.6 for fixed weight based or BSA based dosing respectively. Similar results were obtained for the analysis of pertuzumab serum steady state AUC of these subgroups from 1000 simulated subjects.

Typically humanized IgG monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic small molecule drugs in oncology have been administered on a weight based mg kg or BSA based dose basis. Pertuzumab has undergone testing in the clinic with a phase Ia trial in patients with advanced cancers and in phase II trials in patients with ovarian breast lung and prostate cancer. Pertuzumab was dosed on a weight basis mg kg in a Phase I trial and then initiated using a fixed dose in a phase II trials. Using demographic and serum pertuzumab concentration time data collected in these three trials a population PK model with predictive covariates for pertuzumab PK was built herein. This model was then used to examine the steady state concentrations after fixed dosing weight and BSA based dosing methods.

Pertuzumab PK obtained from this analysis was very similar to those reported for other humanized monoclonal IgG1 drugs used in oncology Harris et al. 21 488a 2002 Leyland Jones et al. 21 3965 71 2003 and Lu et al. 75 91 2004 .

A linear 2 compartment linear PK model best describe the data and in the final model pertuzumab CL was 0.214 L day. Typical Vc of pertuzumab was 2.74 L or approximately 40 ml kg which is equal to human plasma volume and was consistent with values reported for other monoclonal IgG1 drugs Harris et al. 2002 supra and Lu et al. 2004 supra . Pertuzumab CL was significantly affected by body weight and serum concentrations of albumin and alkaline phosphatase while Vc was significantly influenced by BSA. The effect of gender on the pertuzumab PK cannot be assessed because of the small number of male subjects 5.2 included in the analysis. The results from a bootstrap procedure and posterior model checking suggested that the final model was stable and able to describe and predict the data reasonably well.

The effect of weight on CL and BSA on Vc suggested that pertuzumab might be dosed based on either body weight or BSA. However the covariate effect of weight alone and BSA alone in the model only explained about 8.3 and 40 of the inter individual effect of CL and Vc respectively. This suggested that while weight is a predictor of CL and BSA is a predictor for Vc the effect of weight and BSA on pertuzumab exposures after dosing might be measurable but not highly contributory.

Therefore the next step assessed the impact of the various dosing methods on the pertuzumab exposures using simulations. In 1000 subjects bootstrapped from the original data set weight based or BSA based dosing were found to decrease population variability of simulated steady state trough serum concentrations on day 84 by only 6.2 and 5.8 respectively when compared to fixed dosing. In addition the percentages of subjects with predicted steady state trough serum concentrations below a selected target of 20 mcg mL were similar with all three dosing methods. Similar results were obtained from the subgroup analysis in population with extreme body weight i.e. WT 10and 90percentile .

Hence it is concluded that pertuzumab PK is related to WT and BSA. However the WT and BSA explained only a small percent of the inter individual variability of CL and Vc and WT and BSA based dosing do not seem to improve the predictability of pertuzumab steady state exposures. It is recommended to apply fixed dosing regimens for pertuzumab in cancer patients.

The present invention is believed to represent the first disclosure of a critical assessment of the impact of weight or BSA based dosing of a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody on steady state drug concentrations in cancer patients. Implementation of flat fixed dosing has several significant patient care and economic implications i lower costs due to greater efficiency in manufacturing storing and shipping of single unit dose ii efficient preparation of a single dose in pharmacies and hospitals without the need for patient individualization iii greater efficiency in physician prescribing of single unit dose and iv lower likelihood of patient receiving wrong dose due to dose calculation errors. Although humanized antibodies are typically dosed by weight or BSA the analyses herein demonstrate the feasibility of administrating the HER antibody pertuzumab using a fixed dose in cancer patients.
