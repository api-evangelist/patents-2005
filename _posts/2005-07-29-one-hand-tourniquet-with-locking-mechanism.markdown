title: One hand tourniquet with locking mechanism
abstract: Provided is a tourniquet having two opposing and pivotally movable plates. The plates comprise a clamp that pinches an elastomeric cord. The plates are pivotally biased together by a spring. The cord is attached to a back end of the clamp. A free end of the cord is squeezed by the plates such that a loop of cord is provided. The cord can be pulled from the clamp to reduce the size of the loop. The clamp comprises a safety lock that prevents movement of the plates and slipping of the cord. The safety lock can comprise a button disposed between the plates in the back end of the clamp, preventing the plates from moving together in the back portion, and therefore from moving apart in a front portion that grips the cord. Also, the tourniquet clamp can comprise a dual-sided press connector mechanism for fast release of tourniquet tension.

The present application claims the benefit of priority from provisional application 60 591 947 filed on Jul. 29 2004.

The development of the present invention was supported by the US Government under contract number OST 02 DH 08 from the US Special Forces. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates generally to tourniquet devices for blocking blood flow to an injured limb. More particularly the present invention relates to a tourniquet device that can be applied adjusted and released with one hand.

Tourniquet devices are commonly used in emergency medicine to stop blood flow to and bleeding from an injured limb. Tourniquets employ a length of cordage tightened around a limb to stop blood flow and allow clotting to occur. After a tourniquet is applied long enough to allow blood clotting or to stabilize the injury in some cases the tourniquet can be slowly and partially released to prevent damage to the injured limb. It is important for tourniquets to maintain tension reliably a sudden accidental release of tourniquet tension can result in significant loss of blood and renewed bleeding.

Sometimes it is necessary for an injured person to apply a tourniquet to himself. An injured person losing blood is weak and will be unable to apply a large force. Additionally a person applying a tourniquet to himself typically will not have favorable leverage to apply force. Therefore it is important in this case for the tourniquet to be settable with one hand and with a small amount of applied force. Also the tourniquet should be able to be controllably loosened without unintentionally releasing the tourniquet pressure completely.

Tourniquets are essential in emergency medicine and are standard equipment for military and emergency medical personnel. Tourniquets sometimes need to be carried to remote areas and used in dirty outdoor conditions. For this reason tourniquets should be small durable lightweight and reliable.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 125 115 to Mayo et al. describes a tourniquet employing a semi elastic belt clamped between a jamming edge and a roller. The tourniquet of Mayo et al. does not provide a mechanism for locking tourniquet tension so that the tourniquet cannot be accidentally released. Mayo et al. has release mechanisms that can be easily triggered accidentally resulting in sudden and complete loss of tourniquet tension. This is dangerous to injury victims because sudden loss of the tourniquet can result in significant additional loss of blood.

It would be an advance in the art of emergency medicine and tourniquet design to provide a tourniquet that is reliably lockable and not prone to accidental release. It would also be beneficial to provide a tourniquet that can completely stop blood flow with a relatively small amount of applied force so that an isolated single injured person can apply the tourniquet to himself.

The present invention includes a one hand tourniquet having a tourniquet clamp. The tourniquet clamp has two pivotally mounted members which may be plates flat plates or other shapes. The members are biased together at a front end and biased apart at a back end. The members may be biased by a torsion spring for example.

The tourniquet has an elastomeric cord. The elastomeric cord is secured to the back end and passes between the members at the front end. The cord is therefore pinched between the members. Also included is a safety lock which prevents pivotal movement of the members when locking is desired.

The elastomeric cord can comprise a plurality of elastomeric cords. The elastomeric cords can be separately adjustable. Preferably the elastomeric cords have a maximum elongation of at least 75 .

The safety lock can comprise a button that is insertable between the members in the back end. The safety lock will prevent the members from moving towards one another in the back end portion of the clamp. The button can comprise a U shape with flexible legs that allows it to be pressed through a hole in one of the members. The button preferably has steps that engage and lock with the hole thereby preventing movement of the members.

Also the tourniquet can comprise a dual sided press connector for rapidly releasing the tourniquet. The dual sided press connector can be attached to the back end of the tourniquet clamp.

The present invention provides a tourniquet that can be applied with one hand and requires only a small amount of force to completely stop blood flow. The present tourniquet comprises a pair of plates that are pivotally connected and biased together on a front end to form a clamp. The clamp allows elastomeric cord material to be pulled from the tourniquet such that the tourniquet is tightened. The tourniquet also includes a safety lock for preventing the plates from moving after the tourniquet has been set. Preferably the safety lock comprises a button that jams the plates apart on a back side thereby preventing the plates from moving apart on the front side. Additionally the tourniquet may include a dual sided press connector e.g. similar to well known connectors sold under the trademarked names FASTEX or SIDE SQUEEZE for allowing rapid but accident resistant release of the tourniquet.

The clamp has a front end and a back end . The clamp comprises a top plate or member and a bottom plate or member . The plates are pivotally connected at pivot point . The top plate has teeth for grasping a cord not shown in against a roller . The plates are urged by spring such that the teeth and the roller are biased together. The spring causes plates to be biased apart at the back end . As seen in the cord is pinched between the teeth and roller due to the action of the spring . Preferably the bottom plate has a hole for accommodating the cord . The cord has a portion secured to the back end of the clamp e.g. by tying or sewing for example . The cord may have a handle for grasping with one hand. The tourniquet has a loop area for disposing around an injured limb.

In operation the injured limb not shown is disposed in the loop area . The handle is grasped and pulled. The clamp allows the loop area to become smaller but not larger. In other words the clamp allows the cord to pass between the teeth and roller in only one direction .

A benefit of the present invention is that only a small force applied to the handle will create a relatively high tension in the cord and high compression in the loop area .

Preferably in the present invention the cord is made of highly elastic material having a high capability for stretching. For example the cord can be made of multifilamentary elastic material known by the tradename BUNGEE cord. The cord preferably has a capability of at least about 50 75 100 or 150 elongation. High elasticity and elongation provides mechanical advantage for the user and therefore allows the user to more easily achieve high tension in the cord and high compression in the loop area . The cord can comprise a single round or rectangular cord or can comprise a wide strap similar in shape to webbing material. Alternatively the cord can comprise several parallel round cords or wide straps with each cord or strap having a separate handle . If several parallel cords are employed then they can be tightened one cord at a time. One cord at a time tightening allows a weak user to achieve high tension in the cord since tension is additive and highly effective isolation of the injured limb. One cord at a time tightening will also provide high tension needed for isolating legs and other limbs that are difficult to isolate by tourniquet.

The plates can be made of stamped steel molded plastic or other suitable materials. The roller can also be made of plastic or metal.

A button provides a safety lock mechanism. Button is disposed between the plates at the back end . The button holds the plates apart in the back end thereby preventing the plates from releasing their grip on the cord . The button may have a step on an external surface that engages hole in the top plate. The step holds up the top plate and prevents it from moving toward the bottom plate thereby assuring that the tourniquet clamp does not loosen.

FIGS and illustrate insertion and usage of the safety lock button . Preferably the safety lock button has a U shape as shown. The U shape allows legs of the button to be flexed by pressing together as illustrated in . When pressed together the button can be inserted through hole in the top plate . When fully inserted the legs spring back to shape and the top plate is immobilized by the step . The button should have strength and resiliency so that the legs are strong enough to withstand compressive forces for a long duration and so that the legs can flex to allow insertion of the button . The button can be made of molded nylon or spring steel for example.

In operation the button is inserted into the tourniquet clamp after the clamp has been tightened to its desired tension. The button will lock the tourniquet clamp and not allow loosening of the tourniquet. However in some embodiments the tourniquet may be tightened further after insertion of the button .

Alternatively the button can be inserted through the hole in the bottom plate . In this case the button is inserted into the clamp before it is applied to an injured limb.

In order to remove the button and release the tourniquet the leg having the step is pressed inwardly as illustrated by arrow in . Then the button can be pressed through the hole or hole . Alternatively both legs are pressed together. The leg must be pressed sufficiently such that the step can pass through the hole .

It is noted that leg located toward the back end should have a step leg located toward the front end may or may not have a step .

Dual sided press connectors are well known in the art and commonly used in backpacks luggage and the like. For example U.S. Pat. No. 4 150 464 describes a dual sided press connector. Dual sided press connectors are commonly sold under the tradenames FASTEX and SIDE SQUEEZE . Typically dual sided press connectors are made from molded nylon or other polymers.

Although the present tourniquet clamp has been described as comprising plates the invention is not so limited. The tourniquet clamp does not necessarily comprise plates or flat plates. The tourniquet clamp can comprise any curved or shaped members that are pivotally mounted to one another.

It will be clear to one skilled in the art that the above embodiment may be altered in many ways without departing from the scope of the invention. Accordingly the scope of the invention should be determined by the following claims and their legal equivalents.
