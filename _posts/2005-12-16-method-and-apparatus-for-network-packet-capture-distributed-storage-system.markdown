title: Method and apparatus for network packet capture distributed storage system
abstract: This is invention comprises a method an apparatus for Infinite Network Packet Capture System (INPCS). The INPCS is a high performance data capture recorder capable of capturing and archiving all network traffic present on a single network or multiple networks. This device can be attached to Ethernet networks via copper or SX fiber via either a SPAN port () router configuration or via an optical splitter (). By this method, multiple sources or network traffic including gigabit Ethernet switches () may provide parallelized data feeds to the capture appliance (), effectively increasing collective data capture capacity. Multiple captured streams are merged into a consolidated time indexed capture stream to support asymmetrically routed network traffic as well as other merged streams for external consumption.
