title: Underwater surveillance system
abstract: A plurality of sensing modules are deployed by positioning thereof in spaced relation to each other on a seafloor surface at a shallow depth to establish a targeted seawater zone within which certain conditions are detected, such as those produced by the presence of a sea vessel such as a submarine within the targeted zone. Data signals are generated within the deployed sensing modules in response to said detection of the submarine for radio frequency transmission above the seawater targeted zone from floating transmitters ejected from the sensing modules positioned on the seafloor surface after detection of the submarine.

The present invention relates generally to surveillance and collection of data with respect to target zones within a body of seawater involving signal transmission of the data and collection thereof above the seawater surface.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

Surveillance systems have been employed to detect hostile environments such as underwater zones in seawater that are targeted because of corrosion induced by sea vessels. Such systems utilize electronically enhanced magnetic and electric field sensing technologies involving microprocessors to obtain signal surveillance outputs reflecting detection signature classification local positioning and tracking algorithms associated with targets while discriminating against ambient noise and implanted or inserted countermeasures. Such prior surveillance systems involving long range acoustic and magnetic target detection are often unsuitable for targets such as small sea vessels in shallow water environments. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for maximized acoustic magnetic and electric field surveillance sensing to detect and report the location of sea vessel targets such as submarines and surface ships in selected target zones for different mission purposes.

Pursuant to the present invention sensing modules are positioned underwater at preselected sea water locations to establish targeted surveillance zones within which magnetic and electric sensing fields are established for detection limited to targets such as relatively small submarines within shallow depth target zones. According to certain embodiments of the present invention the sensing modules are initially deployed on seafloor surfaces at the bottom of preselected target zone locations. When a target is detected by one of the sensing modules data transmitters are ejected therefrom and float to the top surface of the seawater to then transmit from a radio frequency radiation antenna data signals derived from the collected data within the sensing module from which the floating transmitter was ejected.

Referring now to the drawing in detail illustrates a body of seawater having a shallow depth of less than 300 meters above a seafloor surface . A submarine target is shown in the body of seawater under surveillance within a target zone established by positioning of underwater sensor modules in spaced relation to each other on the seafloor surface . Detection of the target within such target zone is effected by means of a surveillance system associated with the aforesaid array of the underwater sensor modules from which transmitters are ejected and rise to floating level positions at seawater surface as shown in . Once detection of the target by one of the underwater sensor modules has been effected the transmitters are ejected therefrom as hereinafter explained so as to float to the top seawater surface level in response to data signals transmitted at radio frequencies from manned or unmanned data receiving vehicles such as a surface ship or an aircraft . The data signals which originate as outputs from the sensor modules reflect detection times and target location and characteristics. Such data signal outputs from the sensor modules may also be collected within the ejected transmitters floating on the seawater surface for radio frequency transmission of the collected surveillance data to a receiver satellite. The number of the sensor modules utilized will depend on the prescribed area of the target zone over the seafloor surface and the surveillance mission scenario.

As shown in each of the sensor modules has an outer cylindrical housing within which a directional hydrophone is fixedly mounted at a central location adjacent to a fixedly mounted low power triaxial magnetometer . A plurality such as twelve of the transmitters are positioned for ejection from the housing of each of the sensor modules at locations about the centrally located hydrophone and magnetometer therein. Also positioned within the housing of the sensor module are a plurality such as four electric field sensing electrode devices to be ejected from openings in the housing closed by releasable Nitinol closures . Associated with each of the electrode devices is a spring biased electrode field sensor having a D cell battery for powering thereof. An inductive loop coil is positioned on the base portion of the module housing as shown in to induce ejection of the electrode devices from the housing as hereinafter pointed out.

Alternatively the transmitter may be launched by ejection from the sensor module upwardly through the seawater to the floating position by the bias of a Nitinol spring attached to the housing as shown in .

Each of the ejected transmitters shown floating in has an outer float housing internally divided by a partition into an upper section located above the seawater surface and a lower section therebelow. A radio frequency antenna projects into the upper housing section from electronics circuitry therebelow within the lower housing section . AAA size batteries and a local communications receiving bubble coil are associated with the electronics circuitry within the lower housing section .

With continued reference to the digital controller of the system has micro power analog electronic circuitry to which amplified data signals are delivered from the electrode field sensors of the sensor modules through the amplifiers while amplifiers deliver amplified data signals from the magnetometers of the sensor modules to micro power analog electronics connected to the digital controller . Data signals transmitted from the aircraft for example are amplified by an amplifier and fed into the electronics while data signal output of the digital controller amplified by the amplifier is fed to the loop coil and respectively recycled through amplifiers and back into the digital controller and to the electronics circuitry . The magnetometer connected by the amplifiers to the circuitry applies data inputs Hx Hy and Hz thereto while the hydrophone connected through the amplifier to the circuitry and the controller applies an acoustic input A thereto so as to provide well known operational capabilities. Also a real time clock provides a timing input B to the controller . The inputs to and from the loop coil are also applied as amplified input Hz through the amplifier to the circuitry of the controller .

Upon surfacing of one of the transmitters after being physically ejected then transmits to the surface ship the signal data transferred thereto through the loop coil from the controller in one of the sensor modules as hereinbefore described is transmitted to a command center for fusing with data from the other of the sensor modules to determine the factual situation to be dealt with.

Obviously other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
