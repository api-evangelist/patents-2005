title: Multi-modal vinyl ester resins
abstract: Multi-modal vinyl ester resins having one or more of good fracture toughness, good processing viscosity, and low volatile organic compound emissions are provided. The multi-modal vinyl ester resins are the reaction product of a liquid or crystalline epoxy and an amorphous, solid epoxy, as determined at 25Â° C., with a vinyl carboxylic acid. The multi-modal vinyl ester resins may contain a reactive diluent, though generally, lower reactive diluent contents are required for such resins than for similar, commercially available vinyl ester resins.

The present invention relates to the preparation of vinyl ester resins with low volatile organic compound VOC content to reduce hazardous air pollutant HAP emissions. More specifically the present invention relates to multi modal vinyl ester resins.

Styrene is the most common reactive diluent used in thermosetting liquid molding resins. Recently the Federal Environmental Protection Agency of the United States of America introduced legislation to address hazardous emissions from composite manufacturing and repair by enacting new emission standards through the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reinforced Plastic Composites Production which specifically targets styrene methyl methacrylate and mclhylene chloride as regulated hazardous air pollutants. Volatile organic compound emissions are liberated during all of the phases of composite fabrication. Styrene emissions occur during the mixing of diluents catalysts and initiators into the system. Composite parts typically have very large surface to volume ratios which allows up to 20 of the styrene content to be lost during the molding stage. During cure elevated temperatures increase the vapor pressure of styrene and thus increase the rate of VOC emissions. Unfortunately even after cure during the lifetime of the part styrene emissions can be substantial. Past work has shown that up to 50 of the styrene is unreacted after cure. Therefore liberation of VOC emissions must be mitigated not only during composite processing but also during curing and fielding of the composite part.

Simply reducing the styrene content in VE resins causes two problems. First of all the resin viscosity increases unacceptably. The second problem is that the fracture toughness of these resins decreases as the styrene content is reduced. Lower molecular weight vinyl ester monomers can be used to reduce the resin viscosity but detrimentally affects the fracture properties. This is the problem with Dow Derakane 441 400 which uses low molecular weight vinyl ester monomers and only 33 wt styrene. The viscosity is approximately 400 cP which is acceptable for liquid molding operations. On the other hand the fracture toughness is only 100 J m.

Reactive diluents other than styrene have been used to reduce both VOC and HAP emissions. 2 hydroxymethacrylate has been used but the resin viscosity and properties of the resulting polymers are inferior to that of styrene based thermosetting resins. In addition 2 hydroxymethacrylate produces significant VOC emissions. Ortho and para methyl styrene have lower volatilities than styrene however these chemicals still produce significant VOCs and would probably be classified as HAPs if used on a large scale.

Additives such as paraffin waxes have been used to suppress styrene emissions. Yet these resins suffer from poor polymer performance and poor interfacial adhesion in fiber matrix composites. Furthermore studies have shown that these additives do not effectively decrease styrene emissions during the time scale of use.

Vinyl esters are used in military and commercial applications because of their high performance low weight and low cost. Although it is important to reduce the styrene content in these resins the fracture toughness of VE resins must be improved for military automotive and other applications. Many methods have been used to toughen these resins but with little success.

A simple way to improve impact performance of thermosets is through matrix toughening or decreasing the crosslink density of the network. Previous work shows that this method works for vinyl esters. Synthesizing vinyl ester monomers with a higher molecular weight decreases the crosslink density and gives the network more molecular flexibility. A more flexible network corresponds to a tougher system however direct losses are experienced in other mechanical and thermal properties such as modulus and glass transition temperature T . In addition increasing vinyl ester molecular weight also increases resin viscosity. This viscosity increase could prohibit the use of inexpensive liquid molding techniques for composite fabrication.

To avoid significant plasticization of the matrix other methods for toughening can be found in the literature and have been used commercially. Second phase toughening with rubber modifiers that precipitate from solution is one such method. It has heen shown that thermosetting systems such as epoxies can be toughened through rubber modification. For example phase separation of a carboxyl terminated rubber CTBN from a reacting mixture of diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A DGEBA and diamines e.g. diamino diphenyl sulfone results in a well dispersed phase of rubber particles having typical dimensions of 1 m and a material with improved toughness. For higher molecular weight DGEBA systems the increase in fracture toughness is dramatic reaching up to one order of magnitude. The rubber modifier must be miscible with the resin at room temperature and should fully precipitate from solution during cure to avoid plasticizing the epoxy phase.

Because rubber modification of epoxies has been successful it should follow that toughening vinyl esters would experience the same type of success. Dreerman and coworkers attempted to toughen vinyl ester using an epoxy terminated ETBN and vinyl terminated VTBN butadiene acrylonitrile rubber. They found that ETBN yielded the highest degree of toughening with approximately 70 increase in K. This pales in comparison to toughened epoxies which exhibit over an order of magnitude increase in Gfrom unmodified epoxies. Also the rubber modifiers were not compatible with the vinyl ester which is a necessary condition for rubber toughening. Attempts to improve the compatibility increased temperature ultrasonic treatment and surfactants were not successful. Ullet reported similar trends when toughening vinyl ester. Two phase mixtures were reported for butadiene acrylonitrile based rubber modifiers. Compatibilizing agents improved the solubility of the rubber but hindered the phase separation during cure. Also a relatively low increase to K 116 was achieved. Siebert and coworkers were able to obtain higher levels of toughness as high as a 540 increase in K. Unfortunately this toughening required relatively high rubber levels and resulted in a significant plasticization of the vinyl ester matrix. Similar problems with toughening vinyl esters were experienced by other research groups as well.

Bimodal blends of unsaturated polyester monomers have been used to make resins with good fracture properties and reduced resin viscosities. However the viscosities of these resins were significantly higher than what is acceptable for inexpensive liquid molding of composite structures. Blends of VE monomers have also been used to make polymers. Dow Derakane resins typically contain mixtures of VE monomers with molecular weights as low as 540 g mol and as high as 1900 g mol. Because the molecular weights of the components are fairly similar only modest increases in fracture toughness are observed G 250 J m . On the other hand the VE multi modal blends detailed herein have Gvalues greater than 200 J mat low styrene contents 30 wt . . Therefore multi modal blends allow for the production of polymers with high fracture toughness low viscosity and low VOC emissions.

In a first aspect this invention relates to the preparation of multi modal vinyl ester resins with low volatile organic compound VOC content low resin viscosity and high fracture toughness. These vinyl ester resins contain a mixture of low and high molecular weight vinyl ester monomers i.e. bimodal blend for use as liquid molding resins for inexpensive composite fabrication processes such as vacuum assisted resin transfer molding VARTM wet lay up pultrusion and filament winding. The low molecular weight vinyl ester monomers keep the viscosity of the resin low while the high molecular weight monomers improve the fracture toughness of the polymer. As a result these resins have improved fracture toughness relative to commercial resins while having similar resin viscosity. Furthermore low reactive diluent e.g. styrene contents can be used resulting in low VOC emissions while still maintaining acceptable resin viscosity and good tincture toughness.

In a second aspect the present invention relates to a method for the preparation of low VOC multi modal vinyl ester resins. The method includes the step of reacting at least one low molecular weight vinyl ester that is a liquid or crystalline epoxy resin at 25 C. and at least one high molecular weight vinyl ester that is an amorphous solid epoxy resin at 25 C. at a temperature and for a time sufficient to form the multi modal blend of vinyl ester monomers.

In a first aspect the present invention relates to the preparation of multi modal vinyl ester polymers. The invention is applicable to all acrylic and alkyl acrylic vinyl esters.

Vinyl esters suitable for use in the invention include but are not limited to methacrylated and acrylated glycidyl ethers of bisphenols. Typically any epoxy resin or combination of epoxy resins can be employed. Suitable epoxy resins include epoxy resins derived from monomers including but are not limited to bisphenol A hexafluorobisphenol A bisphenol E bisphenol F tetramethyl bisphenol E tetramethyl bisphenol F bisphenol M bisphenol C bisphenol P and bisphenol Z. Methacrylates Monomers such as methacrylates and acrylates of ethoxylated bisphenols may also be employed.

Vinyl esters having vinyl functionality greater than two may also be employed. This includes systems such as acrylic and alkyl acrylic vinyl esters of epoxy novolacs acrylates of tris hydroxyphenylmethane glycidyl ether THPM GE ethoxy phenol novolacs and an epoxy resin derived from ethoxylated tris hydroxyphenylmethane. Also brominated versions of the above systems such as for example brominated bisphenol A based vinyl esters may be employed. Prefened vinyl esters are the bisphenol vinyl esters due to the desirability of making structural composites fiom the resultant polymers.

Vinyl ester monomers were prepared via reaction of a vinyl carboxylic acid with an epoxy resin as shown below for the methacrylation of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol DGEBA .

The vinyl ester multi modal blends were produced using a mixture of a low molecular weight epoxy resin such as Epon 828 and a high molecular weight resin such as Epon 1009F . High molecular weight Epon resins are quite inexpensive. Therefore the vinyl ester multi modal blends not only offer performance advantages but also offer cost savings.

Any vinyl carboxylic acid or blend of acids can be used to form a vinyl ester via reaction with epoxy. Common acids include acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. Any catalyst cane be used that promotes the acid epoxy reaction while maintaining or reducing the rate of epoxy homopolymerization. A homogeneous catalyst can be used in concentrations of as low as 0.01 wt and as high as 3 wt . Heterogenous catalysts can be used in any concentration.

The vinyl ester bimodal blends described in this patent disclosure have sufficiently low viscosities because of the low molecular weight vinyl ester monomer while having high fracture toughness because of the high molecular weight vinyl ester monomer. As a result very large increases in fracture toughness G 500 J m were achieved while still maintaining low resin viscosity.

The preparation of these multi modal blends with defined molecular weight distributions was accomplished by dissolving the high molecular weight Epoxy resin in the low molecular weight epoxy resin and low contents of styrene 20 wt . Small amount of hydroquinone were added to inhibit polymerization during reaction.

These vinyl ester multi modal blends were designed to improve the fracture toughness of vinyl ester polymers as well as to lower VOC emissions while maintaining low resin viscosity and low cost. Commercial vinyl ester resins are inexpensive but also have relatively low fracture toughness. In addition commercial resin systems produce high styrene emissions during all the stages of composite fabrication and usage due to the use of significant proportions of styrene as a reactive diluent in such resins. Multi modal vinyl resins have fracture properties that are superior to that of commercial resins. In addition multi modal vinyl resins require lower styrene contents than commercial resins to obtain good polymer performance. Furthermore because multi modal vinyl blends utilize inexpensive high molecular weight epoxy monomers these resins are expected to be more affordable than commercially available vinyl ester resins.

The monomers described herein may be used to produce resins and polymers with superior properties relative to commercial thermosetting liquid molding resins. Therefore these vinyl ester multi modal blends can be used for the production of polymer matrix composites which are used in military automotive recreational and marine applications. Specific items made from these materials include body panels and armor for vehicles composite hoods and boat hull structures. In addition these materials can be used with traditional thermosetting vinyl and polyester resins to serve as gel coating matter providing a protective coating.

In general references to low molecular weight monomers in the context of vinyl ester monomers refers to vinyl ester monomers that are derived from liquid or crystalline epoxy resins at 25 C. High molecular weight vinyl ester monomers refer to vinyl ester monomers derived from amorphous solid epoxy resins at 25 C. In the context of the present application Epon 828 is the low molecular weight vinyl ester monomer and the other Epon monomers are high molecular weight monomers.

Typically in bimodal vinyl ester blends the low molecular weight monomer comprises 5 65 by weight of the overall resin weight the high molecular weight monomer comprises 5 65 by weight of the overall resin weight and the reactive diluent including styrene ortho methylstyrene para methylstyrene 2 hydroxymethacrylate methyl methacrylate ethyl methacrylate butyl methacrylate methyl acrylate cyclohexyl methacrylate isobomyl methacrylate and fatty acid monomers comprises up to 60 by weight of the overall resin weight. In general the low molecular weight monomers can comprise 1 99 by weight of the overall resin the high molecular weight monomer comprises 1 99 by weight of the overall resin weight and the reactive diluent comprises up to 98 by weight of the overall resin weight. More preferably to reduce VOC it is desirable to employ no more than 40 by weight of the reactive diluent and even more preferably no more than 30 by weight of the reactive diluent and most preferably no more than 20 by weight of the reactive diluent based on the overall resin weight. The reactive diluent component can also be partially replaced by one or more fatty acid monomers described below.

There are at least four potential advantages of various aspects of the present invention. These advantages are 

The multi modal resins of the present invention have been tested experimentally and found to be successful i.e. thermosetting liquid molding resins using vinyl ester multi modal blends have acceptable resin viscosities and thermo mechanical properties similar to that of commercial vinyl ester styrene polymers and fracture toughness greater than that of commercial resins. The vinyl ester resins of the invention may have a glass transition temperature from about 60 C. to about 200 C.

These resins can be cured in any way used to cure free radically reactive systems including but not limited to thermal cure room temperature cure electron beam cure and ultraviolet cure.

The present invention also relates to the process for making the multi modal resins of the invention. The method includes the step of reacting at least one low molecular weight vinyl ester that is a liquid or crystalline epoxy resin at 25 C. and at least one high molecular weight vinyl ester that is an amorphous solid epoxy resin at 25 C. at a temperature and for a time sufficient to form the multi modal blend of vinyl ester monomers. The resulting resin may have a viscosity of from about 30 cP to about 2000 cP at 25 C. and optionally the resin may have a viscosity of from about 30 cP to about 500 cP at 25 C.

All of the various aspects of the invention can be employed in vinyl esters using any conventional reactive diluent. Generally any low viscosity monomer with a single free radically polymerizable group can be employed as a reactive diluent. Exemplary reactive diluents include but are not limited to styrene ortho methylstyrene para methylstyrene 2 hydroxymethacrylate methyl methacrylate ethyl methacrylate butyl methacrylate methyl acrylate cyclohexyl methacrylate and isobornyl methacrylate. All of the various aspects of the invention may also employ a free radical inhibitor such as hydroquinone to reduce or prevent gelation of the reaction mixture.

Alternatively the reactive diluents may include one or more monomers derived from fatty acids. Such fatty acid monomers include current and future commercial fatty acid monomers such as lauryl methacrylate. In addition these monomers may include fatty acid monomers represented by the following formulae 

R R and Rare any fatty acid residue specifically including any C Cresidue including saturated alkyl residue unsaturated alkyl residue acetylenic alkyl residue hydroxy alkyl residue carboxylic acid alkyl residue divinyl ether alkyl residue sulfur containing alkyl residue amide alkyl residue methoxy alkyl residue keto alkyl residue halogenated alkyl residue branched methoxy alkyl residue branched hydroxyl alkyl residue epoxy alkyl residue and fatty acyl CoA alkyl residue ring containing alkyl residue including cyclopropane alkyl residues cyclopentenyl alkyl residues cyclohexyl alkyl residues furanoid alkyl residues phenylalkanoic alkyl residues and lipoic alkyl residues.

Ris any fatty acid segment specifically including any saturated alkylene segment unsaturated alkylene segment acetylenic alkylene segment hydroxy alkylene segment divinyl ether alkylene segment sulfur containing alkylene segment amide alkylene segment methoxy alkylene segment keto alkylene segment halogenated alkylene segment branched methoxy alkylene segment branched hydroxyl alkylene segment epoxy alkylene segment and fatty acyl CoA alkylene segment ring containing alkylene segment including cyclopropane alkylene segments cyclopentenyl alkylene segments cyclohexyl alkylene segments furanoid alkylene segments phenylalkanoic alkyl segments and lipoic alkylene segments of backbone lengths from 1 25 atoms. Ris selected from the group consisting of H and an alkyl residue having 1 10 carbon atoms. Ris an unsaturated cyclic alkyl residue having 10 50 carbon atoms and with Rand Rfunctionality.

A number of synthetic procedures can be employed for making fatty acid based monomers to be used as a reactive diluent in vinyl ester resins. FIG. 1 lists some of the synthetic routes that can be employed. In all of the synthetic routes the starting materials are selected from triglycerides Known 0 fatty acids Known 1a fatty acid methyl esters Known 2a and cyclic fatty acids Known 5a . Refined plant oils contain approximately 99 triglyceride molecules. Industrially fatty acids FA are produced from triglycerides by reaction with a strong acid such as HCl. Fatty acid methyl esters FAME are produced by a methanolysis reaction. In this reaction methanol replaces the glycerol ester linkages of the fatty acids under basic conditions. Cyclized fatty acids may be produced by reacting polyunsaturated fatty acids of triglycerides at high temperatures under basic conditions.

In synthetic Route 1b fatty acids are reacted with an epoxy vinyl species such as glycidyl methacrylate. The carboxylic acid group of each of the fatty acids adds to the epoxide group on glycidyl methacrylate. The resulting species of glycidyl methacrylate fatty acid may be a fairly long hydrocarbon typically 12 26 atoms in length depending on the fatty acid used with a terminal unsaturation site that is capable of free radical polymerization Product 1b . The length of the fatty acid chain affects the resin and polymer properties. Therefore the particular fatty acid used has an effect on the polymer properties thereby allowing customization of the polymer by selection of the fatty acid monomer s .

Any fatty acid can be methacrylated using glycidyl methacrylate. For example butyric acid capric acid caprylic acid lauric acid myristic acid palmitic acid stearic acid oleic acid and linoleic acid were all used as starting materials for such methracrylation reactions. Mixtures of the fatty acids found in safflower oil were also used for methacrylation reactions.

Epoxides such as glycidyl methacrylate react with fatty acids at temperatures below 100 C. with short reaction times if properly catalyzed. A chromium based catalyst AMC 2 Aerojet Chemicals Rancho Cordova Calif. has been successfully used to catalyze this reaction in amounts ranging from 0.1 3.0 wt based on the total weight of the reaction mixture.

Alternatively 0.1 3.0 wt of a 3 1 ratio of triphenyl antimony SbPh to triphenyl phosphine PPh catalyst can be used to catalyze the reaction of epoxides with fatty acids. Near IR or mid IR FTIR can be used to determine the extent of the reaction since the primary epoxide peaks at 4530 cmand 917 cmcan be tracked during the reaction. When the reaction has gone to completion the epoxide peaks disappear indicating substantially complete consumption of the epoxide during the reaction.

In synthesis Route 2b unsaturation sites on fatty acid methyl esters are first epoxidized and then reacted with a vinyl carboxylic acid such as acrylic acid or methacrylic acid. The resulting monomer Known 2b includes an acrylate or methacrylate group which is capable of free radically polymerizing in the middle of a long hydrocarbon chain 20 atoms long . Ideally this monomer will have only a single acrylate group. For this to be the case monounsaturated fatty acids need to be used. Pure mono unsaturated acids are fairly expensive. Canola oil and olive oil are relatively inexpensive sources of mono unsaturated acids but they each have significant contents of saturated and polyunsaturated acids. The preparation ofacrylated epoxidized fatty acid methyl esters is described elsewhere.

Di functional monomers can be used to improve the properties of vinyl ester resins by providing additional cross linking as well as decreasing the amount of unreacted monomer in the cured polymer. Synthesis Route 3 shows a way to produce di functional monomers Product 3b by combining the synthetic procedures of synthesis Routes 1 and 2. Free radically reactive fatty acids Product 3a are an intermediate which are believed to be novel. These species can be used to create free radically reactive surfactants by simple addition of the free radically reactive fatty acid with aqueous sodium bicarbonate.

Allyl alcohol AOH is used to break up the triglycerides into allyl fatty acid monomers synthesis Route 4a Product 4a in a procedure that is very similar to the methanolysis reaction. These monomers AOH FA have a primary unsaturation site that could potentially be used for free radical polymerization. In addition the unsaturation site can be epoxidized to form fatty acids with both primary and secondary epoxide groups synthesis Route 4b Product 4b . This product can be used as an epoxy chemical for various applications such as a chain extender in epoxy resins. In addition the epoxide groups can be reacted with a vinyl acid such as acrylic acid to yield fatty acids with free radical functionality at both the center and end of the fatty acid chains Product 4c .

Allyl alcohol was used to break apart the glycerol linkage of triglycerides in soybean oil to produce allyl alcohol modified fatty acids AOH FA Product 4a . The reaction mixture contained 70 g oil soybean oil 22 ml allyl alcohol and 25.5 ml of a 0.5 N KOH allyl alcohol solution. The contents were mixed and reacted at 60 C. for 3 days. Afterwards the reaction products were recovered using an ether extraction as for the methanolysis reaction. The level of functionalization with allyl alcohol was measured using H NMR. Results have shown that the allyl alcoholysis reaction proceeds to about 80 completion. Other plant oils including olive oil and canola were modified in the same manner with the same results. Therefore this method can be applied to all triglyceride oils. Epoxidation of the allyl unsaturation sites can be done using peroxyacetic acid or transition metal complexes as described elsewhere.

The fatty acids employed to make the fatty acid monomers of the invention can be obtained from any suitable source of triglycerides. Suitable renewable plant sources of fatty acids include but are not limited to almond seed oil arachis groundnut oil canola oil castor oil catnip oil cedarwood oil citronella oil coprah oil corn oil cottonseed oil garlic oil jojoba oil linseed oil neem oil olive oil palm oil palm kernal oil peanut oil perilla oil rapeseed oil rice bran oil safflower oil sesame oil soja oil soybean oil sunflower oil tall oil tung oil butter lard tallow vernonia yellow grease camelina carthame grape seed hazelnut poppy seed oil walnut oil avocado pear black currant borage cacao evening primrose kukui oil and wheat germ oil.

Exemplary classes of fatty acids that may be employed to make the fatty acid monomers of the present invention include but are not limited to straight chain fatty acids branched chain fatty acids and ring containing fatty acids. Straight chain fatty acids include saturated fatty acids monoenoic fatty acids polyenoic fatty acids acetylenic fatty acids hydroxy fatty acids dicarboxylic fatty acids divinyl ether fatty acids sulfur containing fatty acids fatty acid amides methoxy fatty acids keto fatty acids and halogenated fatty acids. Branched chain fatty acids include branched alkyl fatty acids branched methoxy fatty acids and branched hydroxy fatty acids mycolic acids . Ring containing fatty acids include cyclopropane fatty acids cyclopentenyl fatty acids furanoid fatty acids cyclohexyl fatty acids phenylalkanoic fatty acids epoxy fatty acids and lipoic fatty acids.

Exemplary fatty acids that may be employed to make the fatty acid monomers of the present invention include but are not limited to butyric acid capric acid caprylic acid lauric acid myristic acid palmitic acid stearic acid oleic acid and linoleic acid.

The reaction between a stoichiometric amount of oleic acid OA and glycidyl methacrylate GM was catalyzed with 2 wt AMC 2 catalyst and run at room temperature. The reaction went to 90 completion after 3 days of reaction.

The reaction between a stoichiometric amount of oleic acid and glycidyl methacrylale was catalyzed with 0.5 wt 1 wt and 2 wt AMC 2 catalyst and run at 70 C. The reaction went to completion in 1.5 hrs when 2 wt catalyst was used. The reaction went to completion after 2.5 hours when 1 wt catalyst was used. When 0.5 wt catalyst was used the reaction took longer than 4 hours.

The effect of higher reaction temperatures on the reaction of oleic acid and glycidyl methacrylate was studied using 1 wt AMC 2 catalyst. Reaction temperatures of 80 C. 90 C. and 100 C. were used. It was found that increasing temperature decreased the reaction time necessary to reach complete reaction of the epoxides. However at 100 C. HPLC results show the formation of some higher molecular weight species. This indicates that undesirable epoxy homopolymerization etherification occurred to some extent at 100 C.

The SbPh PPhcatalyst also effectively catalyzed the acid epoxy reaction between fatty acids and glycidyl methacrylate. For the reaction of glycidyl methacrylate with oleic acid using 1 wt of this catalyst mixture the reaction went to completion after 5 hours of reaction at 70 C.

In order to simultaneously minimize the catalyst concentration and reaction time 0.1 3.0 wt of a suitable catalyst such as AMC 2 may be employed whereas use of 1 wt AMC 2 was found to be optimum for the reaction of glycidyl methacrylate and oleic acid. Reaction temperatures ranging from 60 90 C. were found to maximize the extent of reaction while minimizing the extent of side reactions.

Glycidyl methacrylate was reacted with stoichiometric amounts of lauric acid stearic acid oleic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid and a mixture of the fatty acids of safflower oil using 1 wt AMC 2 at reaction temperatures ranging from 60 90 C. The conversion of the reactants to the desired product was nearly complete 95 . HPLC results showed that no higher molecular weight species were formed. In addition H NMR confirmed the structure and functionality of these methacrylated fatty acids. This demonstrates to a skilled person that any fatty acid can be successfully modified in this manner to produce a fatty acid monomer.

Synthetic Routes 6 8 make use of the cyclized derivatives of triglycerides. In synthetic Route 6 a methyl ester of the cyclized species is formed via methanolysis Known 6a . The remaining unsaturation sites on the fatty acid are then epoxidized and acrylated to add free radical functionality to the fatty acid Product 6b . In Route 7 cyclized fatty acids are produced by acidolysis of cyclized triglycerides or cyclized fatty acid esters Known 7a . This species is then reacted with glycidyl methacrylate in the same manner as Route 1 to attach vinyl functionality to the end of the cyclized fatty acid. Route 8 is just a combination of Routes 6 and 7 resulting in di vinyl cyclized fatty acid monomers Product 8b .
