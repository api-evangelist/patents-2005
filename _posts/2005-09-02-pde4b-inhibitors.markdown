title: PDE4B inhibitors
abstract: Compounds are described that are active on PDE4. Also described are crystal structures of PDE4B determined using X-ray crystallography, the use of PDE4B crystals and structural information for identifying molecular scaffolds, for developing ligands that bind to and modulate PDE4B, and for identifying improved ligands based on known ligands.
