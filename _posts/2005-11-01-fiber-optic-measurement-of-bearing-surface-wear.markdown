title: Fiber optic measurement of bearing surface wear
abstract: A propeller shaft is supported on the stern end of a ship hull by a bearing within which optic fiber cables are embedded in close spaced relation to the outer cylindrical surface of a bearing supported portion of the propeller shaft for a monitoring wear thereof with maximum accuracy. An optical data acquisition system having a light source and a graphic display is operatively connected to the optic fiber cables through inserted optic connector cables to transmit light from the light source as a signal medium into the bearing so as to render the optic fiber cables therein operative as sensors to detect and measure wear of the entire bearing portion of the propeller shaft surface being thereby monitored. Wear measurement optical signals within the wear sensing cables are then transmitted back to the data acquisition system through the optic connector cables for display of the shaft bearing wear measurements.

The present invention relates generally to fiber optic measurement of mechanical surface wear on a propeller bearing.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The use of fiber optic filaments embedded within a bearing through which a powered propeller shaft extends for optically sensed measurement of shaft bearing wear is generally known as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 080 982 issued Jun. 27 2000 to Edward Isaac Cohen. The geometry associated with such optic fiber sensing measurement of propeller shaft bearing wear is limited to the sensing of shaft wear at fore and aft ends of the bearing which are deemed to be the most critical areas of wear along the axial length of the bearing. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for accurate and more complete measurement of propeller shaft bearing wear along the entire axial length of the bearing.

Pursuant to the present invention measurement of propeller shaft bearing wear based on the amount of light transmitted through optic fiber filaments is effected by configured embedment of a bundle of the optic fiber filaments within a radially inner liner of the bearing which extends axially in close surrounding relation to the rotating propeller shaft throughout its entire bearing length. The bearing embedded optic fiber filament bundle is operatively connected by an insertable fiber optic connector plug to opto electronics through which the embedded optic fiber bundle is rendered operative for most complete sensing and measurement of shaft wear throughout the bearing axial length while allowing for easy removal repair and reinstallation of bearing parts.

Referring now to the drawing in detail illustrates a stern end portion of a ship hull having a bearing support suspended therefrom by a strut . A power driven propulsion shaft extends through the bearing support with a propeller blade attached to a rear end portion of the shaft . As shown in the bearing support has an outer housing within which mechanical stave type of bearing devices are enclosed about the shaft . Each of the bearing devices corresponds to those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 080 982 to Edward Isaac Cohen so as to accommodate embedment therein of a bundle of fiber optic filaments adapted to be connected by an optical fiber connector cable to an opto electric type of data acquisition system as diagrammed in for measurement and display of bearing surface wear of the shaft reflected by the amount of light transmitted through the fiber filaments in the bundles .

Each of the bearing devices as shown in and has a grooved bearing shell positioned within an annular retainer within the housing for positioning of an inner liner extending axially along an axial measurement section of the shaft as indicated in in close spaced relation to an outer cylindrical surface of the shaft . A passage is formed within the inner liner as shown in extending axially in radially spaced relation to the outer surface of the shaft between opposite axial ends of the liner . The optical fiber bundle fills the passage for positioning thereof in such close radially spaced relation to the outer shaft surface throughout along the shaft measurement section . The optical fiber bundle associated with each of the bearing devices at one axial end as shown in is adapted to be engaged by an inserted plug connected to the optical connector cable . Such plugs are respectively inserted into each of the bearing devices for interconnection of the optic fiber cables and to a tester as designated in so as to establish optical signal connections between the data acquisition system and the bearing devices . When such signal connections are established signals in the form of light from a light source associated with the system as diagrammed in is transmitted to the optic fiber cable within the liner so as to provide an optical light signal in response to detection of surface wear of the shaft . Upon generation of such optical wear detection signal it is transmitted from the optic fiber cable through the connector cable to a graphic display associated with the system .

As diagrammed in the optic fiber cable acting as a sensor is positioned in the passage within the liner of the bearing device establishing a straight cable passage path along the axial wear measurement section of the shaft according to one embodiment. According to another embodiment as diagrammed in a cable passage path for the cable along the axial wear measurement section has a wave shape configuration. In either case bearing wear of the shaft is continuously monitored along the length of the wear measurement section during rotation of the shaft . Detection and readout of any shaft surface bearing wear throughout the entire axial length of the shaft within the bearing support is thereby achieved.

Furthermore the heretofore described arrangement involving insertable plug engagement of the connector cable with the cable enables easy disconnection thereof from the data acquisition system and removal for repair of the bearing devices .

Obviously other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
