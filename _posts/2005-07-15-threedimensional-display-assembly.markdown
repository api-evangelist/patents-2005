The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefore.

The invention relates to an image display apparatus and is directed more particularly to an assembly for displaying a full color three dimensional image to observers from any angle surrounding the apparatus.

There are classes of information that are better understood when displayed three dimensionally. This has been done using stereoscopic imagery and special viewing glasses. There are imagers with moving surface light generators and fiber optic point sources but they suffer from inability to simulate solid form.

There is a need for a three dimensional image display assembly which does not require wearable gear such as special glasses and which displays minimal hidden surfaces.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide an image display assembly which displays imagery in three dimensions without requiring special glasses or similar gear for an observer and which displays images of objects with minimal display of hidden surfaces.

A further object of the invention is to provide such an assembly as facilitates viewing of the image from any direction surrounding the image.

With the above and other objects in view a feature of the present invention is the provision of a display assembly for displaying three dimensional images. The assembly comprises a base portion forming a housing adapted to house electronics and mechanics and having a planar surface a projection member disposed in a position removed from the base portion planar surface drive rods extending from the base portion and connected to the projection member the drive rods being movable by electronics and mechanics disposed in the base portion to move the projection member through planes parallel to the base portion planar surface and a transparent envelope enclosing the base portion planar surface the drive rods and the projection member the envelope being adapted to contain a near vacuum therein.

In accordance with a further feature of the invention there is provided such an assembly that facilitates viewing of the images by observers from any direction surrounding the image.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular assembly embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that an assembly for displaying three dimensional images includes a base portion forming a housing configured to contain electronics and mechanics not shown for operation of the assembly during a viewing exercise. The housing is provided with a primary planar surface .

A projection member which may be planar as shown in or may be of a curved or of other selected configurations is disposed in a position removed from and parallel to the housing planar surface if the projection member is planar. In one embodiment the projection member comprises a selected one of a color liquid crystal display or the like and a masking layer disposed over the display. In an alternative embodiment the projection member comprises a phosphor screen or the like adapted to be energized from a rear light projection device said base portion being adapted to have the projection device mounted thereon. It is to be understood however that the invention is not limited to the above described display embodiments and is capable of embodiment with all equivalent display technology including plasma displays and the like. Drive rods that extend from the housing are connected to the projection member and support the projection member . A transparent envelope encloses the base portion planar surface the drive rods and the projection member . The drive rods are axially extendible and contractible so as to vary the lengths thereof and thereby vary the distance between the projection member and the housing surface . In a preferred embodiment the drive rods comprise a selected one of threaded rods and telescoping rods facilitating movement of said projection member towards and away from the geometric plane of said base portion and through the parallel geometric planes. The interior of the envelope is placed under a near vacuum to facilitate easy movement of the projection member through the envelope interior. In a preferred embodiment the surface of the projection member when parallel to the plane of said base portion is viewable through said envelope from 360 around said projection member .

Because of the thickness of the masking pixel layer viewers from different viewing angles will observe a different set of exposed pixels . In the enlarged and removed area A of it will be seen that if a three by five masking pixel area is made transparent a viewer from the perspective of the reader sees only a two by four display pixel box area near the far edges. By selectively rendering masking layer pixels transparent one can control what portions of the display pixel layer are seen from what viewing angles.

The projection member is then moved by the drive rods to another level one pixel height lower at which point four separate projections are made in sequence one for each viewing quadrant. Two of the quadrants are shown in . In the near right side of the box is drawn for viewers within sight of that quadrant but masked from viewers opposite to the reader. Then the steps illustrated in occur drawing the near left side of the box. In two further steps the far right and far left sides are similarly drawn but those illuminated pixels are not viewable to the reader.

If there is shown what an observer on the other side of the display would see during the writing of the near right face of the box. There may develop a small angle where some light from a display pixel would be viewable beyond a desired cutoff point. This can cause a faint ghosting of that wall but will be reduced with decreasing pixel size and will be reduced as the ratio of depth to width of the masking pixels increases.

In there is illustrated diagrammatically the result when two or more layers have been drawn. The box structure is not really there but is a mental image left because of the writing speed of the assembly and the retinal image retention of the eye brain combination.

When objects are behind each other the rear objects as shown in cannot be masked making the nearer objects appear somewhat transparent. However because of retention of depth perception the viewer is able readily to see that the objects are spatially separated.

There can thus be provided a full color projection produced in such a manner that the viewing angle around the display chamber determines which display pixels are seen and therefore what surfaces are hidden. This provides the appearance of three dimensional solid forms with very little distortion and without limitation to a particular horizontal viewing angle. The image has good vertical range of view and the assembly requires no special glasses.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
