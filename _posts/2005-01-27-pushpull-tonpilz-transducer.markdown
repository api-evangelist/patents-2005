This application claims rights under 15 U.S.C. 119 e from U.S. Application Ser. No. 60 539 389 filed Jan. 27 2004 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The invention was made with United States Government support under Contract No. N00014 00 D 0104 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention.

The Tonpilz transducer has been the dominant technology for high power underwater sound generation for many years. is a schematic drawing of a typical transducer . A head mass piezoceramic stack and a tail mass are bolted together with a tie rod and nut . The other end of tie rod is threaded and inserted into a tapped hole in head mass .

The piezoceramic stack consists of several annular rings through which tie rod passes. In eight rings are shown although numeral is only shown for the uppermost three.

One such ring is depicted in which shows the central aperture through which the tie rod passes. Also shown in are top electrode consisting of metalization applied to the top surface of ring and bottom electrode consisting of similar metallization applied to the bottom surface of ring .

These electrodes are often somewhat smaller than the top and bottom surfaces of the piezoceramic ring to prevent arcing when a high voltage is applied between electrodes and .

In in each ring an arrow is shown to symbolically represent the piezoelectric polarization of the ring. By convention when a positive voltage is applied between electrodes and the piezoceramic expands in thickness. Conversely when a negative voltage is applied the piezoceramic thickness decreases. If the voltage is an alternating voltage waveform such as sine wave the piezoceramic will vibrate at the frequency of the waveform.

Referring to when several rings are stacked up all the top electrodes are electrically connected together forming a common external connection . Similarly all bottom electrodes are connected to form a common external connection . It will be understood that a filled circle denotes an electrical connection whereas a line crossing has no electrical connection. An open circle denotes an external connection.

Referring to Tonpilz transducer is connected by and to electrical matching elements which are interposed between a power amplifier . Matching elements may consist of a transformer a capacitor or an inductor or a combination thereof selected in accordance with the electrical properties of the transducer and power amplifier by techniques well know to those practiced in the art. These matching elements are used to optimize electrical efficiency. Electrical energy moves between the piezoelectric stack and the matching elements every half cycle of the applied voltage waveform.

Depending on the power levels to be achieved with the transducer these matching elements in particular inductors may be physically large and require heavy gage wire to support the current requirements of the transducer. Often the required inductance is obtained using a magnetic core in inductor leading to further size and weight to avoid saturation of the magnetic material. Once again these techniques are well known to those skilled in the art.

The present invention is a Tonpilz transducer which includes a first stack of piezoceramic elements with a first plurality of electrodes connected to form a first pair of external connections. There is also a second stack of piezoceramic elements with a second plurality of electrodes connected to form a second pair of external connections and the first and second stacks of piezoceramic elements have opposed polarizations.

The push pull Tonpilz transducer of the invention is shown in . In place of the stack of eight disks with similarly aligned polarizations as shown in there are two separate stacks and with opposed polarizations and respectively. Interconnections within each stack are made as before however stack has its own external connections and and stack is connected at and . These external connections are made to the push pull amplifier at similar positions as shown.

While the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments of the various figures it is to be understood that other similar embodiments may be used or modifications and additions may be made to the described embodiment for performing the same function of the present invention without deviating therefrom. Therefore the present invention should not be limited to any single embodiment but rather construed in breadth and scope in accordance with the recitation of the appended claims.
