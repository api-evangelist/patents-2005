title: System and method for automatically synchronizing security-relevant information between a relational database and a multidimensional database
abstract: A security management system and method for managing access security in an IT-environment comprises a relational database of the ROLAP type and a data warehouse of the MOLAP type. The system shares a subset of common data, wherein database access security for accessing particular database tables is managed by user-related access limitations in a table form. The present system transforms the access-limiting conditions existing at the ROLAP system automatically to a respective filter criterion for the MOLAP system. The access-limiting conditions exiting at the ROLAP system are defined in a table form. The present system and method automatically activates filter criterion whenever an access to the MOLAP system is requested by a user.
