This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 550 779 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PERFORMING BET PROTECTION filed on Mar. 5 2004 and this application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The field of the invention relates generally to gaming and more particularly to games having protection for bets placed by a player.

Casino games are popular and recently many varieties of new Casino games have been introduced especially those that can be played over a network such as the Internet. These games allow in some jurisdictions players to make bets and win prizes as if they were playing in a casino. The Internet has gained a great deal of popularity on certain betting card games such as blackjack. The rules of these types of games are similar to those played in a casino and therefore these games have similar odds of winning as casino games.

Bet protection is often used by players engaging in gaming in order to limit their risk in playing the game. One such game in which players often utilize bet protection is blackjack where bet insurance is available in several forms these bet protection forms are referred to as blackjack insurance and surrender. 

 Blackjack insurance provides each player with the option of making a side bet if that player believes based upon the dealer upcard that the dealer may have a blackjack. Blackjack insurance is considered a side bet because it is distinct from the player s initial bet. A player is allowed to make a blackjack insurance side bet only if the dealer upcard is an ace. Typically a player is typically allowed to wager for this side bet up to one half of his initial bet. A player wins this side bet if the card that was initially dealt face down to the dealer completes a blackjack for the dealer and otherwise loses this side bet. A player who wins this side bet e.g. there is a blackjack for the dealer will typically be paid based upon his side bet using a 2 1 ratio e.g. such that a 5 side bet results in a 15 payout . If there is no blackjack for the dealer the player loses the side bet. Because a player who wins this side bet is likely to have lost the initial bet e.g. the dealer s hand turned out to be a blackjack the player s winnings on this side bet typically cancels out the player s loss on his initial bet. Thus blackjack insurance allows the player to hedge his her initial bet to lower their risk of losing. Also with blackjack insurance each player is allowed to place a side bet that will win if the dealer s hand turns out to be a blackjack.

Another form of bet protection in blackjack referred to as surrender provides each player with the option of terminating a round of play after the starting hands have been dealt. Such an option is useful in situations where that player has been dealt a bad starting hand that is likely to bust if an additional card is drawn or to lose to the dealer s hand if an additional card is not drawn . If for example a player s starting hand includes a 5 and a 10 and the dealer s upcard is a Jack only an additional card of 6 or below will not bust the player while standing with only 15 points is likely to lose to the dealer. In this situation the player is likely to bust or lose. Surrender is typically practiced by the player taking back one half of his initial bet and surrendering the other one half of his initial bet to the dealer while terminating the round of play. For example if a player who made a 10 initial bet surrenders he she takes back 5 of his her initial bet surrenders the other 5 to the dealer and terminates the round of play. Historically the surrender option has not proven to be popular among blackjack players.

Under the conventional rules of blackjack the player is often left in a position of not wanting to play additional hands despite having already committed an initial bet on that hand. If the player has already lost a number of hands and believes that he she is undergoing an unlucky streak he she may become frustrated or discouraged and may stop playing the game. When a player stops playing the casino or the gaming site will earn no additional revenue from the player.

Therefore according to one aspect of the present invention it is appreciated that a more expansive form of bet protection should be provided to players that is considered safer by players. Preferably such a form of bet protection prevents the player from being discouraged from playing further and could profitably be provided by a physical on line or virtual casino offering one or more games. These games for example may be conventional casino games such as blackjack or may be any other type of game with which bet protection may be implemented.

One aspect of the present invention relates to a system and method for performing bet protection. In particular a method and system is provided for allowing a player to subscribe to more than one gaming session with an associated subscription fee and for allowing the player to recover at least a portion of that fee under certain circumstances. In this way the player is allowed to offset the risk of losing their subscription fee. For instance it may be advantageous for a player to place a bet protection wager that acts as insurance if the player does not achieve a particular outcome within a game. In this example a portion of the subscription fee may be refunded if the player does not achieve the particular outcome. This outcome may be for example a particular player standing in the game such as total points rank or other method for measuring standing.

One aspect of the present invention relates to providing bet protection associated with a subscription fee paid by a player to play a plurality of games. In conventional games such as blackjack a player is allowed within a single game the opportunity to refund a bet associated with the single game if the bet protection criteria are met.

As discussed above with reference to blackjack a player is likely to be dealt one or more bad starting hands each of which is likely to bust or to lose to the dealer s hand. Under the traditional rules of blackjack a player who is dealt such a bad starting hand has limited options. If the player makes a bust insurance side bet it is very likely that the player will lose his her bet. Thus surrender option has not proven to be extremely popular with blackjack players. Therefore under the traditional rules of blackjack the player is not provided many options and as a result the player often becomes discouraged and stops playing the game.

Conventional games and systems that allow a user to play games such as blackjack provide additional options to players to be used in single round of play. For example one type of game allows the player an option of placing a bust insurance side bet which the player wins if his hand busts upon drawing a predetermined number of additional cards in an attempt to improve his starting hand. Another conventional option allows a player to mortgage a round of play in accordance with at least one revised rule which is unfavorable to the player in exchange for receiving an advantage e.g. a revised rule which is favorable to the player during the current round of play. Other conventional prior games and game systems provide insurance or bet protection options to a player however these types of protection are limited to a single round of play.

Various aspects of the present invention relate to providing to the player the option of purchasing bet insurance which is not limited to a single round of play. Rather various aspects of the present invention provide insurance across a number of game sessions. Payment for insurance may be for example paid at the start of the plurality of game sessions. At a predetermined point during the plurality of game sessions the players total accumulated points during multiple rounds are determined resulting in the player s standing which is compared to a predetermined standing. If the player s total points fall below this standing number the subscription fee is returned to the player and the insurance amount is retained by the gaming operator. For example if the player s points total is 48 points and the predetermined standing is at least 50 points it is determined that the player falls below this level and thus the subscription fee is returned to the player and the insurance fee is retained by the gaming operator.

Alternatively the player s standing may be determined relative to the standings of other players and players that do not meet a minimum standing may be refunded at least a portion of their subscription fee. Additionally if the player does not meet a predetermined e.g. a minimum standing the player may be eliminated from the remainder of the plurality of game sessions.

Such methods of providing insurance has advantages over conventional implementations of bet protection. For example in conventional games that offer insurance if a player loses during one round of play he she is often discouraged from engaging in further rounds due to the fear of losing even more money. Here because the player pays a fixed subscription fee the player can play multiple rounds without the fear of losing an excessive amount of money. The insurance amount ensures that the player will lose a limited amount of money from the outset and limits the player s loss if the player does not achieve a particular standing in the gaming sessions. For instance if the gaming operator determines that the standing of the player is below a predetermined level the subscription fee is returned and the player is eliminated from further participating ensuring that the maximum amount the player loses is his her insurance fee. Because of the increased safety factor as a result of purchasing insurance players are encouraged to continuously participate in games thus resulting in further profit to the gaming operator. Also the player is more likely to use the insurance option.

According to one aspect of the present invention a method of conducting a game is provided. The method comprises acts of providing for an entry of a player in a plurality of game sessions accepting payment of an entry fee associated with the plurality of game sessions determining a standing of the player in the game and determining whether the determined standing is determined to meet a predetermined standing and if not refunding at least a portion of the entry fee.

According to one embodiment of the present invention the act of providing an entry includes an act of entering the player in a plurality of game sessions of blackjack. According to another embodiment of the present invention the act of determining whether the determined player in a plurality of game sessions of blackjack has accrued a minimum number of points. According to one embodiment of the present invention the method further comprises an act of receiving an entry fee from the player before the player plays the plurality of game sessions of a blackjack game. According to one embodiment of the present invention the act of receiving the entry fee further comprises an act of providing the player with an option of paying a bet protection fee. According to one embodiment of the present invention the bet protection fee is accepted by a gaming operator. According to one embodiment of the present invention the method further comprises an act of eliminating a player from the plurality of gaming sessions if the player does not meet the predetermined standing.

According to another embodiment of the present invention the player meets the predetermined standing at a midpoint of the plurality of game sessions and wherein if it is determined that the player does meet the predetermined standing the bet protection fee is not refunded to the player.

According to one embodiment of the present invention if the player does meet the predetermined standard the method further comprises an act of permitting the player to continue play in the plurality of game sessions. According to another embodiment of the present invention if the player meets the predetermined standard the method further comprises an act of retaining the bet protection fee. According to another embodiment of the present invention if the player chooses not to pay the bet protection fee and the player does not achieve a winning standing in the plurality of game sessions the method further comprises an act of retaining the entry fee.

According to another embodiment the method further comprises an act of providing for an entry of the player in at least one game session using an alternative method of entry AMOE . According to another embodiment the AMOE is performed by at least one of a mail entry or through the Internet.

According to another aspect of the present invention a system is provided for conducting a plurality of game sessions. The system comprises an interface that receives from a user an entry to a plurality of game sessions a payment component adapted to accept an entry fee associated with the plurality of game sessions and is adapted to accept a bet protection fee that offsets at least a portion of the risk of losing the entry fee.

According to one embodiment of the present invention the system further comprises a controller adapted to determine a standing of the player in the plurality of game sessions. According to another embodiment of the present invention the controller is further adapted to conduct the plurality of game sessions.

According to one embodiment of the present invention the system further comprises means for storing a predetermined standing and wherein the controller is adapted to compare the determined standing and the predetermined standing. According to one aspect of the present invention the controller is further adapted to if the player does not meet the predetermined standing eliminate the player from playing in the plurality of game sessions. According to one aspect of the present invention the payment component is adapted to provide payment to an external payment system. According to another aspect of the present invention the payment component is located in a legal gambling jurisdiction.

According to another embodiment of the present invention the system further comprises means for entering the player in at least one game session using an alternative method of entry AMOE . According to another embodiment the system further comprises means for entering the player using AMOE by at least one of a mail entry or through the Internet.

Further features and advantages of the present invention as well as the structure of various embodiments of the present invention will be more fully understood from the examples described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following examples are intended to illustrate the benefits of the present invention but do not exemplify the full scope of the invention. All references cited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.

One aspect of the invention relates to a method for protecting bets placed by a player. As discussed a player is allowed to subscribe to more than one game session with an associated subscription fee and the player is allowed to offset the risk of losing at least a portion of that fee by placing a bet protection wager. This wager acts as insurance if the player does not achieve a particular outcome in the multiple gaming sessions.

Such a method for implementing a bet protection may be performed on a general purpose computer system as discussed further below in relation to . More particularly a gaming system may be provided that presents a game and having an interface through which a player may obtain a protection for a bet. In one embodiment the bet protection wager is associated with a subscription fee paid by a player to play multiple game sessions. These game sessions may be for example the same game different games or combinations of different sets of games.

System includes an interface that interacts with a user e.g. a player to place bets and communicate information relating to a game session. Interface may be for example an interface of a computer system. For example interface may include an interface presented by a browser program operating in a memory of a computer system. In one specific example the computer system upon which the interface may reside includes a general purpose computer system associated with the player such as a personal computer PC .

System may also include a game processor which performs functions relating to one or more game sessions. Game processor may be for example a process executing in a memory of system . Processor may receive and process bets placed by users through interface conduct game sessions and rules of the game and determine wins and payouts to players.

Information relating to game sessions may be stored in one or more storage entities e.g. a device such as a disk associated with system . Storage may for example store information directly relating to game play e.g. a number of players current score current state of game play or other information relating to game play and payment. System may include a payment component that receives payment information from a user through interface to pay for bets placed by the player. Payments may include for example wagers placed by players or any additional bets e.g. bet protection payments paid by a player in association with playing a game. Payment component may communicate with one or more payment systems for the purpose of obtaining payment for playing the game.

One or more components of system may be located on one or more computer systems. For example components of system may be distributed on multiple computers coupled by a communication network. It should be appreciated that components of system may reside on a single computer or may be distributed among multiple computers and the invention is not limited to any particular implementation.

Prior to a game session a game player may need to pay for playing. For example a game player may pay using money or loyalty points. In particular a game player may pay using money by debit card credit card check cash or from an account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively a game player may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The game player may pay in person e.g. by using a cashier or by other remote methods including telephone handheld device kiosk computer through the Internet or other network and mail. Payment may be in any form that is legal in the particular jurisdiction.

In one embodiment of the invention players may subscribe to play multiple consecutive game sessions. That is the player pays at one time to play many consecutive game sessions. According to one embodiment such players may subscribe to multiple games e.g. fixed odds or non fixed odds games using a computer based interface e.g. a personal computer cell phone PDA set top box or other interface . In one example these subscribed games may be automatically played e.g. by a computer system without the need to interact with the game provider as discussed more fully below. In another embodiment the player may also choose to have his or her subscription automatically renewed. These games may be for example conventional casino type games such as blackjack. They may involve skill on the part of a player to influence outcome of the game or they may be pure games of chance.

According to one embodiment of the invention a player may be provided the option of purchasing bet protection to offset the risk of losing a subscription fee for playing multiple games. An example process for playing a plurality of game sessions involving the purchase of bet protection is shown in . At block process begins. At block a player is provided an option for purchasing bet protection. This may be presented for example by an interface e.g. interface of a computer system e.g. system .

In one example the player is allowed to purchase bet protection prior to the game at the beginning of the game or during game play. At some point during or at the end of playing multiple games a player s standing is determined at block . A player s standing may be determined for example by a game processor that conducts game play.

The player s standing may be for example based at least in part on the number of points accrued or levels achieved by the player within the game. Alternatively the player s standing may be determined relative to the standings of other players within the game. If at block the player s standing does not meet a predetermined standing the player is refunded at least a portion of the subscription fee at block . In this manner the risk of losing the subscription fee by the player for play at a level lower than the predetermined standing may be offset by paying an additional bet protection fee. At block the player may be eliminated from playing further game sessions. For instance in a multiplayer game occurring over multiple game sessions the player may be eliminated from further play in the multiplayer game.

If at block it is determined that the player does meet a predetermined standing the player is permitted to continue to play in further game sessions. The predetermined standing may be for example an arbitrary standing or other criteria used to measure the advancement of the player within one or multiple game sessions. Such criteria may include the number of points achieved money or other parameter. Notably if the player meets the predetermined standing the bet protection is not activated and the player continues playing. In one example if the bet protection is not activated at the point of evaluation of the player s standing the bet protection is not activated during any point in the play of the remaining game sessions. At block process ends.

At block the player plays one or more of the multiple game sessions. At a predetermined point during game session play a player s standing is compared to the standings of other players at block . At block it is determined whether a player s standing is below a predetermined standing e.g. a minimum standing . If at block it is determined that a player s standing is not below the predetermined standing the player is allowed to continue to play in one or more remaining game sessions at block . If however the player s standing is below the predetermined standing it is determined whether the player purchased insurance at block . If not the player is permitted to continue to play in one or more remaining game sessions.

If the player did purchase insurance the player is refunded their subscription fee at block . In one example the player may be refunded the full subscription fee but it should be appreciated that in one embodiment a portion of this fee may be retained by the gaming operator. Further the operator may retain the insurance or bet protection fee at block . As a further option the player may be eliminated from playing in one or more remaining game sessions at block . For example in a multiplayer game involving multiple game sessions the player may be eliminated from the multiplayer game and may be prohibited from playing in any further game sessions. At block process ends.

According to one embodiment of the invention players may also enter to play this or any other wagering game of chance using an alternative method of entry AMOE . Conventionally AMOE is a required available method of entry that does not require a purchase. Sweepstakes are usually used as a promotional or marketing tool. Any company or organization offering a sweepstakes ticket in exchange for a purchase is typically required to also offer an AMOE to the sweepstakes that is not linked to a purchase. A common AMOE method includes sending by an individual interested in entering the sweepstakes to the sweepstakes offeror a postcard with his or her name address or other contact information. Another AMOE method is signing on by the individual to a free Internet website and submit the required information for free. Numerous other methods may be used for AMOE. Most sweepstakes limit the number of times one individual or family may enter a sweepstakes by AMOE. An individual entering a sweepstakes by AMOE is required by law to have the same odds of winning each of the available prizes as do individuals who have paid for entry e.g. by making a purchase of a product or service .

According to one embodiment of the invention it is realized that an AMOE alternative method of entry may be used to enter a game of chance. More particularly it is possible to develop implement and run wagering games of chance including the inventive games described herein with an AMOE method of entry. AMOE methods are conventionally used to enter a player in a sweepstakes which is not considered wagering or gambling. Thus according to one embodiment of the invention an individual may enter a wagering game of chance by AMOE using for example the postcard or the online method outlined above. A wagering game of chance player entering by AMOE may have the same odds to win the payout associated with the game session in which they are entered as other paying players. The wagering game of chance player entering by AMOE may also be limited in playing a small number of game sessions within a given period of time. For example the player may be permitted to play one game session in one year two game sessions in one month or other limited number of games in a defined period. Other numbers of sessions and given periods may be any number and the invention is not limited to any particular implementation.

According to one embodiment the game session that the game player entering by AMOE is entered into may be determined by the game player on the AMOE entry form. For example the postcard AMOE may be required to state the date and the time of the game session that the game player wants to enter. Alternatively the game session entered into by the game player may be the next starting game session after the AMOE is received and logged. As another alternative AMOE entries may be assigned to a specific game session s each hour day week or other time interval.

Winners may be chosen among multiple players having particular hands e.g. in the case of blackjack cell content e.g. as in bingo or similar game or other content relating to a game of skill or chance. Winning content may be randomly drawn by hand or by computer system from the predetermined set of cell content for a game session. When the drawing is performed by hand the winning cell content may be chosen for example from pieces of paper out of a hat or drum by using balls or discs in a rotating or air blown sphere or any other method that can be used for drawing content for a game session e.g. for the games of keno or bingo . Hand drawn winning content may then be displayed or entered into a computer system. Preferably the winning content is randomly drawn by computer system from the predetermined set of content for a particular game session.

The game player may view the game proceedings using television wireless or line telephone with display handheld device kiosk computer or in person. For example the game player may operate a computer system that has an Internet enabled interface e.g. using Macromedia Flash or Java and the computer system may display streamed game information within that interface. It should be appreciated that any interface may be used to display game proceedings and that the invention is not limited to any particular interface. Depending upon the viewing medium it may be necessary to download game information prior to viewing while another viewing medium may allow viewing of the streamed game information.

When a player matches enough winning content to obtain a winning pattern outcome for a game session the player may inform the game operator e.g. in the case of bingo that he she is a winner. If the game player is playing the game in person this act of informing may include raising one s hand or visually indicating that he or she is a winner. The game operator then verifies that the game player actually won. If the game player plays the game remotely for instance over the web or interactive television or if the game operator is a computer system then other electronic or voice indication method may be necessary to authenticate and verify the game player and the winner s . Such methods are well known in the remote and electronic gaming industry.

In the case of a bingo like game a player may manually daub his or her game card s on paper or by whatever means the player is viewing the game proceedings e.g. by daubing a game card in an interface of a computer system after a winning content is drawn. Preferably a computer system e.g. a personal computer PC set top box PDA phone may automatically daub the matching cell content of each game card being played in a game session after each drawn winning cell content. The game player may view the game proceedings using any interface including a television a wireless or other type of telephone having a display a handheld device a kiosk or computer. However because the computer is adapted to automatically daub matching cell content the game player may decide not to observe the drawing of winning cell content.

The computer system may then automatically determine when a game card or hand is a winner. Such a result may be automatically authenticated and verified by the computer system. In this instance the computer system may then notify the game player that he or she has won and what the winnings e.g. cash points etc. are after the computer has consulted a predetermined payout table. The computer may also determine if the winning needs to be shared with other winning game cards. Notification of winning to a game player may occur by mail e mail computer web or network telephone television pager fax kiosk or any other method.

The computer system may also determine the game card s or hands and the associated player identity ies that are closest to winning. The computer system may then display the game card s hands or the identity of the game player s closest to winning to all game players observing the game session. The computer system may also choose to display only one or a subset of all the game cards hands or identities of players closest to winning to a particular game player observing the game session.

After a winner is authenticated and verified the computer system may then notify all game players observing the game session that a win has occurred. Additionally the computer system may display the winning game card or hand the winning player s identity or the payout. Because the game session may not end until a predetermined fixed number of turns or predetermined amount of time has passed it is possible for this notification to occur several times each time for a different game card or hand during a particular game session.

During a period of time between game sessions a game operator may make announcements rest or perform any number of actions. If the game is played using a computer system advertisements sponsorships public service announcements or any visual or auditory content may be inserted into these periods. Advertisements and other content may also be inserted into the game display during a game session.

In a configuration where the computer automatically daubs the game cards or plays hands for one or more players it may be beneficial to allow a game player to remotely access information indicating the results of a game session after the session has completed. In this manner a player may not need to attend a particular game session as results of each session may be accessed at a later time. Further the player need not access the game session results from the same interface at which the game was played or subscribed. Remote access may be gained for example by kiosk telephone television computer handheld device or any other device or system that is appropriate. Information that may be accessed regarding a past game session may include whether the player won or lost what the player s payout was or other information relating to the past game session.

A game player may also be able to replay or review a past game session using a video enabled device. For instance a kiosk telephone having a display television computer or handheld device may be used to replay a past game session. By accessing a selected game session in the computer system a game player may be able to see a past game session as it occurred the winning hands or cards and winning game player identity ies the drawn winning cell content or possibly any other aspect of the game session of interest.

Preferably the game its game sessions and the game play are partially or fully automated using one or more computer systems. More preferably the game its game sessions and the game play are fully automated. A computer system may be a single computer that may be a supercomputer minicomputer or a mainframe or personal computer. A computer system used to run a game and its associates sessions and may also include any combination of computer system types that cooperate to accomplish system level tasks. Multiple computer systems may also be used to run a game. The computer system also may include input or output devices displays or storage units. It should be appreciated that any computer system or systems may be used and the invention is not limited to any number type or configuration of computer systems.

A computer system that executes a game according to various embodiments of the invention may include for example one or more system components. One such system is shown by way of example in . In the example one system component e.g. payment system may handle payment subscription and or AMOE by players to enter the game sessions. Another system component e.g. system may handle playing and viewing the game and a third system component e.g. system may perform payout functions. Such a game system may also be connected e.g. by direct line or network to other computer systems including systems for handling casino or hotel loyalty programs reservations in room television viewing gambling floor kiosks or other systems. Connections to other computer systems may be performed using one or more of the system components described below.

A payment component e.g. system may include one or more of a number of well known systems as shown in . For example a player may be able to pay to play one or more games using a telephone and speaking with a call center representative who inputs player payment and subscription information manually into a computer using a user interface. In the computer data may be stored in a data which is stored in a memory of the computer system. As used herein a data structure is an arrangement of data defined by computer readable signals. These signals may be read by a computer system stored on a medium associated with a computer system e.g. in a memory on a disk etc. and may be transmitted to one or more other computer systems over a communications medium such as for example a network. Also as used herein a user interface or UI is an interface between a human user and a computer that enables communication between a user and a computer. Examples of UIs that may be implemented with various aspects of the invention include a graphical user interface GUI a display screen a mouse a keyboard a keypad a track ball a microphone e.g. to be used in conjunction with a voice recognition system a speaker a touch screen a game controller e.g. a joystick etc and any combinations thereof.

Player information may also be entered into a payment system component. Player information that may be input includes name address telephone number and age and payment information may include credit or debit card number or loyalty account information. Also as discussed above various aspects of the present invention relate to subscription gaming for wagering games of skill or chance. Subscription information may be input including for example a first game session date and time a number of game sessions to be played a number of game pieces to be played per game session and bet per game piece bet per hand or other parameters. Based upon the payment and subscription information the call center representative may verify that the payment information is valid and that enough credit or funds is available for the player s desired subscription.

A similar system may exist for players entering using a mail or a postcard AMOE as discussed above except the call center may be replaced by a mail center having representatives that enter information into one or more computers via a user interface. For example a cashier that works at a casino directly with players that pay cash or credit to play may also have the ability to input player account and subscription information for AMOE players using a user interface of computer.

Computer systems or pay engines for handling electronic or online payment and subscriptions may also be used. Such systems are well known and include such systems as PayPal iKobo Verisign and other systems. Using such a system a player interacts with a user interface to input information into a payment data structure that may be transferred to one or more payment systems e.g. PayPal .

Various payment systems and one or more user interfaces may be located on computer systems coupled by a network with the computer system s storing data having player account and subscription information. As used herein a network or a communications network is a group of two or more devices interconnected by one or more segments of transmission media or active communications equipment on which communications may be exchanged between the devices.

The above examples are merely illustrative embodiments of a payment system component. It should be appreciated that an illustrative embodiment is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as any of numerous other implementations of a payment system for example variations of online payment are possible and are intended to fall within the scope of the present invention. For example the payment system may include using pay per view systems associated with interactive television or the pay engine may additionally deliver a receipt to the player by either e mail or mail. None of the claims set forth below are intended to be limited to any particular implementation of a payment system unless such claim includes a limitation explicitly reciting a particular implementation.

Payout systems are also well known. Any of a number of standard systems or payout engines for making payouts for winning may be used as shown in . For example a standard application programming interface such as Quicken Intuit Inc. Mountain View Calif.
