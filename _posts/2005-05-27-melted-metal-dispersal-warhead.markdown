title: Melted metal dispersal warhead
abstract: Molten droplets of a metal fuel, such as aluminum, are dispersed into air or water for a reaction releasing energy for military or other purposes. In one warhead embodiment, a cylinder of solid metal is disposed within a ceramic heat insulator; heaters of thermite-like material are embedded in the metal; and an explosive dispersing charge is disposed around or at one end of the cylinder. On activation, the heaters are ignited to melt the metal, and the charge then detonated to disperse droplets of the molten metal. In a related embodiment, the metal and heaters are within a containment having an atomizing nozzle at one end and, oppositely of the metal from the nozzle, a piston and gas generator. When the metal is melted, the gas generator is activated to expel molten metal droplets from the nozzle. The fuel may be pressed particles heated below the melting point and then dispersed by a charge providing enough heat to melt the particles; may be a single component, fuel-rich thermite compound; and may include droplet surface tension reducing additives. Advantages are that the weight and volume of a warhead do not include explosives, binders, and underwater-use oxidizers employed with fuel particles in conventional energetic materials. A warhead may thus have greater density for effective penetration; and, since the fuel is not incorporated in an explosive, dispersing charges can be removed until use, and metal fuels hazardous when incorporated in an explosive can be used.

Present U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 151 187 as filed on May 27 2005 is a Divisional Application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 609 865 as filed on Jul. 1 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 059 250.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties therefore.

The present invention relates to ordnance to explosives and to thermic compositions and charges. The invention particularly relates to explosives where a fuel reacts with oxygen from standard environmental conditions such as air or water without ignition by a catalyst pyrophoric material or other fuel. The invention also relates to devices in which a material is heated within a container from which molten reactive particles are dispersed by an explosive or expulsion from a nozzle.

It is well known to incorporate a metal fuel such as aluminum in energetic materials where typically particles of the fuel when oxidized provide a portion of the energy produced by the materials.

Heretofore however in using such a metal fuel it is mixed in particulate form or otherwise combined with an explosive additional fuel oxidizing and or other materials. Examples are detonating substances such as HMX or RDX and substantially inert binders. For underwater use such a metal fuel is typically provided with an oxidizer such as ammonium perchlorate and a detonating substances with a substantial amount of oxidizer such as PBXN 111 or PBXN 103 are used.

These materials other than the metal fuel are disadvantageous to the extent that they take up a substantial part of the bulk and weight of a warhead or the like. Further these materials are of relatively low density and strength and thus disadvantageous in a penetrating warhead.

When such a metal fuel is mixed with its dispersing and igniting explosive or other reactive material the metal and material are limited to those that do not interact in storage or otherwise present a safety hazard. Also such a mixed arrangement is undesirable since a dispersing charge cannot be removed from a warhead or other device to make it substantially inert.

It is known to disperse materials into an air or water environment for subsequent ignition and or detonation as shown by the following seven United States patents 

U.S. Pat. No. 3 496 867 issued 24 Feb. 1970 to McDonald for thermal radiation weapons and discloses that combustible dusts and gaseous fuels have been mixed with air and detonated. Aluminum magnesium boron boron carbide zinc and zirconium are mentioned as fuels and these fuels are used with a liquid combustible fuel including pyrophoric substances to provide continuous ignition.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 685 453 which issued 22 Aug. 1972 to Hamrick for an antipersonnel mine destruct system discloses pressurization by gas from a gas generator of highly explosive gases expelled from a nozzle for subsequent detonation by a high explosive charge.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 730 093 issued 1 May 1973 to Cummings for explosive apparatus and shows a fuel surrounded by high explosive whose implosion expels the fuel radially into a fuel air cloud. Proposed solid fuels are materials such as napthelene decomposable into detonable molecules . The apparatus has a central tube filled with a mixture which undergoes a thermit reaction and is also dispersed by the detonation of the explosive into the dispersed fuel for ignition of the fuel air cloud to overcome problems with timing such ignition after dispersion of the fuel has commenced.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 372 213 issued 8 Feb. 1983 to Rozner et al. for a molten metal liquid explosive method and discloses a pyrotechnic pellet and igniter therefor within a casing which may be aluminum placed in water. The pyrotechnic material may be composed of nickel aluminum and copper oxide powders. The pyrotechnic material melts the casing so that molten metals from the pellet and casing contact the water and cause an energetic vapor or steam explosion . It is stated that although the cause of such explosions is unknown they would provide moderate sized high energy explosive devices. A spatially inverse arrangement is also disclosed and has from outside to inside such pyrotechnic material aluminum metal and water.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 463 680 issued 7 Aug. 1984 to Sayles for a method of generating single event unconfined fuel air detonation achieved by simultaneous dispersion of both fuel and an initiating chemical catalyst into the atmosphere where the fuel may be a volatile liquid . . . aluminum boron or mixtures thereof . However the metal is intended to be always used in such liquid. An explosive disperses ferrocenyl catalyst into diesel fuel and disperses both into the atmosphere for explosive detonation of the fuel air mixture .

U.S. Pat. No. 5 866 840 issued 2 Feb. 1999 to Briere et al. for nozzles for pyrophoric IR decoy flares and discloses the expulsion of pyrophoric liquids specifically alkyl aluminum compounds which burn with desirable IR emissions from nozzles by a piston driven by gas from a gas generator.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 354 220 issued 12 Mar. 2002 to Graham et al. and discloses an underwater explosive device utilizing an explosive loaded with a metal such as titanium magnesium or aluminum. It is stated that water can be an oxidizer for fuel rich products of detonation but does not give optimum results a deficiency overcome by the provision of high pressure oxygen around the explosive.

In a melted metal dispersal warhead or other device incorporating the principles of the present invention for military or other purposes molten droplets of a reactive metal fuel such as aluminum are dispersed into air or water to undergo an energy releasing reaction therewith out the use of further ignition means such as a catalyst pyrophoric material or other fuel dispersed into or with the droplets.

In accordance with the invention the metal is heated as by a thermite like reaction and subsequently dispersed by an explosive or by expulsion from a nozzle by gas pressure.

In one warhead embodiment of the invention a cylinder of solid metal is disposed within a ceramic heat insulator heaters of thermite like material are embedded in the metal and a dispersing charge of explosive is arranged around or at one end of the cylinder. On activation the heaters are ignited to melt the metal and the charge is then detonated to disperse droplets of the molten metal.

In a related embodiment the metal and heaters are within a containment having an atomizing nozzle at one end and oppositely of the metal from the nozzle a piston and gas generator. On activation the metal is melted as described above and the gas generator is then activated to expel molten metal droplets from the nozzle.

In the practice of the invention the fuel may provided as pressed particles heated to near but below the melting point and then dispersed by a charge providing enough heat to melt the particles. Also the fuel may be incorporated in a single component fuel rich thermite compound and may include droplet surface tension reducing additives.

It is an object of the present invention to provide ordnance or other devices wherein energy is released by a reactive metal with minimal amounts of explosives oxidizers and other substances.

A further object is to provide such devices for use in the atmosphere and underwater so that fuel is oxidized in the air or water without ignition means such as a catalyst pyrophoric material or other fuel dispersed into or with the metal.

Another object is to provide such a device wherein the energy releasing materials have relatively high density and strength.

Yet another object is to provide such a device where the reactive metal is not in contact with other reactive materials so that the metal need not be compatible therewith and so that any dispersing explosive element may be removed for safety in storage and handling.

Additional objects are to provide such energetic devices which have the foregoing advantages and are fully effective for their intended use.

Referring more particularly to the drawings shows a melted metal dispersal warhead which is constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention and is a first embodiment thereof.

As with other embodiments the warhead is an ordnance device for dispersing molten droplets of a reactive metal fuel into a fluid environment of the warhead so that the metal fuel undergoes an energy releasing explosive exothermic reaction with the fluid which is typically selected to be the natural atmosphere or a natural body of water such as the ocean. The invention is characterized by this reaction initiating upon such dispersion by reaction of the metal with a substance such as oxygen or water in the selected environment without the use of any catalyst any pyrophoric material or any reactive or oxidizable material other than the molten reactive metal itself. That is only such molten droplets are dispersed into the fluid environment to initiate the energy releasing explosive exothermic reaction.

Warhead is shown in before actuation and in this condition has a quantity of solid reactive metal preferably substantially pure aluminum and typically of cylindrical configuration in which is embedded any suitable heaters which are activated to melt the metal. It is apparent that the heaters heat the metal at least to its melting point and thus into a range of temperature including the melting point of the metal. For this purpose the heaters may be materials which are be ignited in any suitable manner to undergo a thermite reaction effective to melt the metal in a relatively short time. For the purposes of the present application a thermite reaction is a reaction between a metal oxide and a reactive metal such as the well known reaction between powdered iron oxide and powdered aluminum metal.

The solid reactive metal is disposed in a container which is preferably constructed of any suitable ceramic insulating material so that this material is disposed for thermal insulation of the metal during heating by heaters and retains the metal after melting as seen in where the molten metal is indicated by numeral and the residue of the heaters is suggested by lines .

In warhead container is surrounded exteriorly and circumferentially with a layer of any suitable explosive material which is thus juxtapositioned to reactive metal to rupture the container and to disperse the molten metal as molten droplets into the environment when material is detonated. Such explosive material may be disposed otherwise than circumferentially of a cylinder of the reactive material to vary the distribution of the dispersed droplets.

It will be apparent that other embodiments of the present invention having the reactive metal in particulate form are possible. For one such embodiment the particulate metal may be heated completely to melting before dispersal as in the embodiment of .

In another such embodiment the reactive metal in particulate form may be mixed with thermite reaction heating material rather than having this material in discrete heaters as shown in . When the reactive metal is so mixed it may be brought to melting before dispersal as with the embodiment of or its melting may be completed by the explosive dispersal charge as with the embodiment of .

It is apparent that in the above described warhead embodiments of the present invention materials providing a thermite reaction are placed in a container with a reactive metal an explosive material is placed adjacent to the container the thermite reaction materials are ignited to heat the reactive metal so that when the warhead with the metal is placed in a fluid environment and the explosive material is exploded after heating the reactive metal by a thermite reaction molten droplets of the reactive metal are formed and dispersed into the fluid environment to cause an explosive reaction between the reactive metal and any suitable substance in such environment the reaction initiating forthwith upon dispersion of the molten droplets without the assistance of a catalyst pyrophoric material or reactive or oxidizing material other than the reactive metal.

Warhead has a generally cylindrical container constructed of any suitable ceramic insulating material disposed within a casing . The casing is provided at one end with an atomizing or droplet dispersing nozzle which is of any appropriate construction and communicates by a passage with the container interior.

As seen in warhead is like warhead in having before actuation within container and at the end thereof bearing nozzle a quantity of solid reactive metal in which is embedded thermite reaction heaters which are ignited to melt the metal. However warhead has at the end opposite the nozzle any suitable gas generator indicated by numeral and has a piston disposed between the gas generator and the quantity of solid reactive metal.

When warhead is actuated as shown in heaters are ignited and after metal is melted as indicated by numeral gas generator is activated so that pressurized gas therefrom acts on piston as indicated by arrows and urges the piston toward nozzle so that the molten metal is expelled as indicated by arrows from container through communicating passage and from the nozzle to form in the environment of warhead droplets of the hot molten reactive metal. These droplets react forthwith and in accordance with the present invention with a substance in the environment so that an explosive reaction occurs between the reactive metal and the fluid environment without initiation by a catalyst pyrophoric material or reactive material other than the reactive metal.

It is evident from the foregoing description of various embodiments of the present invention that all these embodiments carry out a process for causing an explosive reaction wherein a reactive metal is disposed in a container before placing the metal in a fluid environment selected for exothermic reaction with hot molten droplets of the metal after the metal has been brought to at least its melting point by heat from at least one exothermic reaction applied to the reactive metal in the container molten droplets of the reactive metal then being dispersed into such environment to initiate the explosive reaction between the reactive metal and the fluid environment.

It is also evident that these ordnance device embodiments are adapted for disposition in an air environment or in an underwater environment so that when the quantity of reactive metal contained in the device is dispersed therefrom in molten droplet form for an energy releasing reaction with oxygen or water in such environment the reaction is initiated solely by reaction of molten droplets of the reactive metal with the oxygen or water without the assistance of a catalyst pyrophoric material or additional oxidizable material.

Although the present invention has been herein shown and described in connection with what is conceived as the preferred embodiment it is recognized that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention which is not limited to the illustrative details disclosed.
