title: Symbol grouping and recognition in expression recognition
abstract: A mechanism for recognizing and inputting handwritten mathematical expressions into a computer by providing a part of a multi-path framework is described. The part of the multi-path framework includes a symbol grouping and recognition component that is designed to group input strokes that correspond to a handwritten mathematical expression into a symbol and to recognize the symbol based upon information associated with the grouped input strokes. A method for grouping and recognizing symbols of a handwritten mathematical expression includes receiving a plurality of input strokes corresponding to a handwritten mathematical expression, grouping the plurality of input strokes into symbols, recognizing the symbols based upon information, such as shape and time series information, associated with the grouped input strokes. Intra-group and inter-group information associated with the plurality of input strokes may be utilized to group the input strokes.
