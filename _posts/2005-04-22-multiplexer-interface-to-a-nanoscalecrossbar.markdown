This invention has been made with Government support under Agreement MDA972 01 3 005 awarded by DARPA Moletronics. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to electronic devices and circuits and in particular to a multiplexer for reading information stored in a nanowire crossbar memory and for interfacing a nanowire crossbar to sub microscale and or microscale electronics.

Recently as the design and manufacture of electronic devices and circuits by conventional photolithography based methods has begun to approach physical limits to further decreases in component sizes alternative methods for manufacturing nanoscale electronic circuits have been developed. Nanowire crossbar technology is a particularly promising new approach to fabrication of electronic circuits and devices with dimensions significantly less than and component densities correspondingly greater than the submicroscale circuits and components that can be currently produced by photolithographic methods.

In many nanoscale memory embodiments the contents of a single bit storage element such as single bit storage element in are modified by applying voltage or current signals to one or both of the nanowires that intersect to form the single bit storage element in order to change a physical state of the bistable bit storage layer within the nanowire junction such as the resistivity. In for example signals may be applied to one or both of nanowires and to modify single bit storage element as indicated in by arrows such as arrow . Generally no signal or a different signal is applied to the remaining nanowires to distinguish the addressed single bit storage element from all other single bit storage elements. In many embodiments signals of relatively large magnitude are applied to carry out WRITE operations in which a physical state is changed while relatively smaller magnitude signals are applied to carry out READ operations in which the physical state is generally not changed but instead merely determined. In READ operations a physical state of a single bit storage element is determined from the presence absence or strength of a signal on one or both of the two nanowires that intersect to form the single bit storage element by applying one or more signals to nanowires of the nanowire crossbar. Nanoscale memories implemented by nanowire crossbars can be thought of as two dimensional arrays of single bit storage elements each single bit storage element separately and uniquely addressable through the two nanowires that intersect to form the single bit storage element. In certain cases entire rows columns or larger groups of single bit storage elements within a two dimensional nanoscale memory can be accessed in a single operation.

Significant problems may be encountered with respect to interconnection of individual nanowire leads of a nanowire crossbar to submicroscale and microscale signal lines in order to incorporate the nanowire crossbar into conventional electronic devices including identifying and manipulating individual nanowires. One solution to these problems is to employ demultiplexers with microscale or submicroscale address lines that are integrated with nanowire crossbars. shows a nanowire crossbar memory integrated with nanoscale microscale demultiplexers to allow individual bit storage elements of the nanowire crossbar memory to be uniquely accessed via microscale or submicroscale address lines. In a 16 16 nanowire crossbar has parallel nanowire layers in which nanowires are extended past the boundaries of the nanowire crossbar array to form a first demultiplexer and a second demultiplexer . Demultiplexer comprises the extended nanowires from a first parallel nanowire layer of the nanowire crossbar such as nanowire overlain or underlain by a perpendicular microscale or submicroscale source voltage line and four pairs of perpendicular microscale or sub microscale address lines. The second demultiplexer is similarly implemented from the extended nanowires of the second parallel nanowire layer of the nanowire crossbar. In certain types of implementations such as the implementation shown in address lines occur as complementary pairs each pair representing one bit and its inverse of a multi bit address while in other implementations single address lines may be used. Four bit address input through the four pairs of address lines are sufficient to provide a unique address for each of the 16 nanowires such as nanowire and two four bit addresses input simultaneously to the four pairs of address lines of each of the two demultiplexers and can uniquely address a particular nanowire junction from among the 256 nanowire junctions within the nanoscale crossbar array .

By placing a WRITE signal on the nanowires of a nanowire crossbar memory that intersect at a particular single bit storage element the state of the single bit storage element can be set to a desired one of the two bistable states that encode binary digit values 0 and 1. However determining the state at a given single bit storage element by applying a READ signal may be significantly more difficult. Designers manufacturers vendors and integrators of nanowire crossbar memories as well as ultimately users of such devices have recognized the need for a reliable and efficiently manufactured means for reading the states of single bit storage elements within a nanowire crossbar memory and designers manufacturers vendors integrators and users of other types of nanowire crossbar implemented devices have recognized the need for a reliable and efficiently manufactured interface for interconnecting the nanowire crossbar implemented devices with sub microscale and microscale electronics.

Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to electronic means for reading the content of a nanowire crossbar memory. In one embodiment of the present invention a microscale or submicroscale signal line is interconnected with one set of parallel nanowires emanating from a nanowire crossbar memory by configurable nanowire junction switches. The microscale or submicroscale signal line serves as a single wire multiplexer allowing the contents of any particular single bit storage element within the nanowire crossbar memory to be read in a three cycle READ operation.

Various embodiments of the present invention include electronic multiplexers for reading the contents of a selected single bit storage element within a nanowire crossbar memory. In the current discussion the term nanowire refers to signal lines with widths less than those of sub microscale signal lines that can be currently fabricated with conventional photolithographic techniques less than 50 nanometers less than 20 nanometers or less than 10 nanometers. The term nanowire junction refers to an interconnection between a nanowire and another component whether a second nanowire or a signal line or other component of larger scale. illustrate a first electronic multiplexer means a READ operation employing the electronic multiplexer means and deficiencies and disadvantages of the electronic multiplexer means. employs illustration conventions used in all of . In a 6 6 nanowire crossbar memory stores single bits of information at each of 36 single bit storage elements fabricated at nanowire junctions that interconnect nanowires of a first set of vertical parallel nanowires and nanowires of a second set of horizontal parallel nanowires . Each nanowire junction is represented in as a diode such as diode directionally interconnecting a horizontal nanowire to a vertical nanowire. In the case of nanowire junction horizontal nanowire and vertical nanowire are interconnected with current or voltage signals generally transmissible through nanowire junction from horizontal nanowire to vertical nanowire but not under normal operating conditions in the reverse direction. The bistable memory layer of the nanowire crossbar includes a semiconductive sub layer film or another chemical or physical means that allows signals to pass in a forward direction indicated by the direction of the arrow in the diode symbol but resists passage of signals in the opposite direction. Diode nanowire junctions are preferable in nanowire crossbar memory applications because they eliminate unwanted circuits in the nanowire crossbar memory as discussed below.

A first demultiplexer controls input of voltage or current signals to the horizontal set of nanowires and a second demultiplexer controls input of signals to the vertical set of nanowires . Thus a particular single bit storage element such as single bit storage element can be written by applying a first WRITE signal to nanowire by demultiplexer and a corresponding second WRITE signal to nanowire by demultiplexer . In certain embodiments of a nanowire crossbar memory the first WRITE signal may be a relatively large magnitude positive voltage signal while the second WRITE signal may be a relatively large magnitude negative voltage signal. Application of the first and second WRITE signals results in a substantial voltage drop across the single bit storage element placing the single bit storage element in one of two stable physical states. The single bit storage element can be placed in the other of two stable physical states by applying the second WRITE signal to horizontal nanowire and the first WRITE signal to vertical nanowire or in other words by reversing the signs of the voltage signals applied to the nanowires.

The contents of a selected single bit storage element within the nanowire crossbar memory shown in are read using a single wire multiplexer interconnected with the horizontal set of nanowires by diode like nanowire junctions . The single wire multiplexer may be connected with an amplifier in order to amplify a signal produced by a READ operation and is also interconnected through a resistor to ground . The resistance of the resistor needs to be carefully chosen to be sufficiently high to direct signals input from the horizontal nanowires to the single wire multiplexer to the amplifier but sufficiently low to pull the single wire multiplexer to a low voltage or low current state in the absence of an input signal. Furthermore the resistance may need to be variable in order to prevent undesired state changes or damage to the diode like nanowire junctions interconnecting the horizontal nanowires with the single wire multiplexer .

When the single bit storage element is in an open state as indicated by the unfilled circle at the intersection between horizontal nanowire and vertical nanowire a relative weak voltage or current signal applied to nanowire by the first demultiplexer indicated in by the symbol H and by the thickened dark line superimposed over the line corresponding to nanowire the input signal passes all the way to the single wire multiplexer results in detection of the signal by the single wire multiplexer as indicated by the symbol H on the signal line output from the amplifier . The relatively weak voltage current signal applied to horizontal nanowire passes nanowire junctions because the diode like nanowire junctions are not forward biased as a result of input of matching relatively weak voltage or current signals to vertical nanowires and by the second multiplexer . Although the second demultiplexer applies a low voltage to vertical nanowire as indicated in by the symbol L the weak voltage or current signal applied by the first demultiplexer to horizontal nanowire cannot pass through nanowire junction to vertical nanowire held in a low state by demultiplexer due to the high resistance of nanowire junction in the open state. Because the first demultiplexer holds horizontal nanowires and in a low voltage state all of the remaining nanowire junctions interconnecting vertical nanowires and with horizontal nanowires and are not forward biased and therefore current or voltage cannot leak through these nanowires to horizontal nanowires and . Therefore only the relatively weak voltage or current signal applied by the first demultiplexer to horizontal nanowire reaches single wire multiplexer . Note also that the resistance of resistor is sufficiently high that the signal applied by the first demultiplexer to horizontal nanowire is mostly directed to amplifier rather than dissipated to ground .

When the single bit storage element is in a low resistivity state or closed as shown in by a filled circle at the intersection between horizontal nanowire and vertical nanowire the relatively weak current or voltage signal applied by the first demultiplexer to horizontal nanowire passes through nanowire junction to vertical nanowire held in a low voltage or low current state by the second demultiplexer rather than passing to the single wire multiplexer . Therefore a low signal is output by the amplifier interconnected with the single wire multiplexer .

Unfortunately there may be problems associated with the single wire multiplexer implementation discussed above with reference to . These problems are primarily related to the diode like nanowire junctions interconnecting the horizontal nanowires with the single wire multiplexer .

A first problem associated with the single wire multiplexer implementation discussed above is that it may be technically or economically impractical to fabricate diode like nanowire junctions between the horizontal nanowires and the single wire multiplexer. The single wire multiplexer may be manufactured in a separate step partially or fully external to the nanowire crossbar memory. Dependable fabrication of diode like nanowire junctions between nanowires and a microscale or submicroscale single wire multiplexer may not be technically feasible in certain cases or may introduce sufficient additional manufacturing costs to make the single wire multiplexer implementation too expensive for volume manufacturing. In certain cases it may even be impractical or impossible to fabricate reliable diode like nanowire junctions anywhere within a nanowire crossbar memory let alone at intersections between nanowires and a microscale or sub microscale single wire multiplexer.

A second problem associated with the single wire multiplexer implementation discussed above is that even if the diode like nanowire junctions interconnecting the horizontal nanowires with the single wire multiplexer can be fabricated they must be fabricated within relatively close tolerances in order to ensure that undesirable circuits do not develop within the nanowire crossbar memory. illustrates undesirable circuits within a nanowire crossbar memory during a READ operation when diode like nanowire junctions interconnecting the nanowires with a single wire multiplexer do not operate with specified directional signal transmission characteristics. In single bit storage element is in an open state resulting in transmission of a weak voltage or current signal applied to nanowire by the first multiplexer all the way to the single wire multiplexer . However nanowire junctions and despite not being forward biased according to their specifications nonetheless pass current in the reverse direction from the single wire multiplexer back to horizontal nanowires and . Therefore the signal applied to nanowire by the first demultiplexer returns via nanowires and to the first demultiplexer rather than passing to the amplifier resulting in output of a low signal by the single wire multiplexer rather than the high signal that should be detected when single bit storage element is in an open state as discussed above with reference to .

A third problem associated with the single wire multiplexer implementation discussed above is that the electrical characteristics of the diode like nanowire junctions interconnecting the horizontal nanowires with the single wire multiplexer need to be carefully balanced with respect to the electrical characteristics of the single wire multiplexer and other electronic components of the nanowire crossbar memory. For example the diode like nanowire junctions interconnecting horizontal nanowires with the single bit multiplexer need to be forward biased by signals applied to horizontal nanowires by the first demultiplexer but should not be forward biased or in a low resistance state in the absence of applied signals. It may be difficult to match the characteristics of the diode like nanowire junctions to those of the single wire multiplexer.

The switch like diode junctions are configurable. They can be opened by applying a first RESET signal through the horizontal nanowires and a second RESET signal through the single wire multiplexer and can be closed by applying a first SET signal to the horizontal nanowires and a second SET signal to the single wire multiplexer. The signs and magnitudes of the RESET and SET signals may vary depending on the particular chemical and physical characteristics of the switch like nanowire junctions. For example in certain cases a first RESET signal may constitute a relatively large magnitude positive voltage applied to a nanowire and a second RESET signal may constitute a relatively large magnitude negative voltage applied to the single wire multiplexer . In this case the opposite first and second SET signals may have similar magnitudes but opposite polarities.

Modifications within the spirit of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example any of many different techniques and materials for fabricating switch like nanowire junctions to interconnect nanowires of one plane of parallel nanowires in a nanowire crossbar to a single wire multiplexer. As another example a single wire multiplexer may be used to extract information from any number of nanowire crossbar implemented devices including memories. Depending on the implementation of the switch like nanowire junctions a different READ cycle sequence may be used in alternative embodiments. In yet additional embodiments the multiplexer wire may also be a nanowire interconnected with other nanoscale sub microscale or microscale components.
