The present invention provides compounds and methods for the treatment of traumatic brain injury inflammatory bowel disease IBD Crohn s disease ulcerative colitis arthritis multiple sclerosis atherosclerosis and sepsis. The present invention also relates to methods of protecting subjects from the effects of radiation including total body irradiation and localized radiotherapy and is relevant to the fields of transplantation cancer therapy and emergency medicine in the case of an accidental or deliberate exposure to ionizing radiation.

There are multiple convergent lines of evidence suggesting that apoE apolipoprotein E plays an important role in modifying clinical outcome in acute and chronic neurological diseases. These clinical observations based on apoE genotype of the patient are consistent with murine models of stroke and traumatic brain injury TBI in which apoE exerts neuroprotective effects Laskowitz et al. 1997 Sheng et al. 1998 1999 Lynch et al. see below .

ApoE is a 299 amino acid protein with multiple biological properties. First identified for its role in the transport and metabolism of cholesterol and triglycerides apoE serves as a ligand for the low density lipoprotein LDL receptor the LDL receptor related protein LRP and the very low density lipoprotein VLDL receptor Weisgraber 1994 . In addition to its role in cholesterol metabolism recent compelling clinical data suggests that apoE also plays a significant role in the neurobiology of acute and chronic human disease. There are three common human isoforms designated apoE2 apoE3 and apoE4 which differ by single amino acid interchanges at residues 112 and 158 Weisgraber 1994 . Presence of the APOE4 allele has been associated with increased susceptibility of developing late onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer s disease AD . Recent clinical evidence also strongly implicates the presence of the APOE4 allele with poor outcome following acute brain injury See Laskowitz et al. 1998a 1998b Crawford et al. 2002 .

It has been observed that apoE influences development of late onset and familial AD. This effect is robust and dose dependent such that homozygous individuals with an APOE4 4 genotype have an approximately 20 fold increased risk of developing AD and heterozygous individuals with an APOE3 4 genotype have a 4 fold increased risk relative to patients who are homozygous for the most common APOE3 3 genotype Strittmatter et al. 1993 Corder et al. 1993 reviewed by Laskowitz et al. 1998a . This observation has led to a resurgence of interest in the function of apoE in the mammalian central nervous system CNS . Because of its association with AD multiple laboratories have examined interactions between apoE and proteins believed to play a role specific to the pathogenesis of AD. Thus several laboratories have described isoform specific interactions between apoE and Abeta or apoE and tau Strittmatter et al. 1994 Gallo et al. 1994 Fleming et al. 1996 reviewed by Laskowitz et al. 1998a . The role of apoE in the CNS however remains undefined and it is unclear which of these interactions are relevant in human neurodegenerative disease.

Traumatic brain injury TBI is a leading cause of injury related death and disability among children young adults and the elderly in the United States. Epidemiological data have demonstrated the serious socioeconomic impact of TBI to society estimating that the cost of hospital care alone exceeds 1 billion per year. The estimated incidence of TBI doubles between the ages of 5 and 14 years and peaks for both males and females during early adulthood to approximately 250 per 100 000. Because the lives of most survivors of moderate to severe TBI involve chronic life long neurological disabilities with varying degrees of dependence the cost in individual suffering family burden and financial burden to society may be greater for those who have more years to live. Thus there is a need for improved treatments for TBI.

U.S. application Ser. No. 10 252 120 filed Sep. 23 2002 discloses methods of using apoE analogs including COG133 to treat or ameliorate the neurological effects of cerebral ischemia or cerebral inflammation. COG133 is a small truncated peptide comprised of residues 133 149 of the entire apoE protein. While COG133 has proved useful in animal studies it has a limited treatment window within which it must be administered. Thus there is still a need for improved treatments for TBI.

In addition to TBI toxicities associated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy can adversely affect short and long term patient quality of life can limit the dose and duration of treatment can be life threatening and may contribute to both the medical and non medical care costs. Adverse consequences of cancer treatment have led to the development of specific agents designed to ameliorate or eliminate certain chemotherapy and radiotherapy toxicities. The ideal chemotherapy and radiotherapy protectant agent would prevent all toxicities from non life threatening side effects alopecia to irreversible morbidities hearing loss neurotoxicity to potentially fatal events severe cardiomyopathy severe thrombocytopenia without adversely affecting the antitumor efficacy of the cancer therapy and would be easy to administer and relatively nontoxic in its own right. However most agents developed to date have a much narrower spectrum of toxicity protection Hensley et al. 1999 .

Xerostomia and mucositis are major toxicities that are associated with radiation therapy. The risk of these complications is related to the area undergoing radiation the dose and schedule of radiation therapy whether radiation therapy is combined with chemotherapy and a number of host disease related factors that are only partially understood Mossman 1994 . Although these toxicities are rarely associated with mortality the morbidity can be quite significant for patients with acute and long term consequences. Xerostomia is the most common toxicity associated with standard fractionated radiation therapy to the head and neck region. Whereas acute xerostomia from radiation is due to an inflammatory reaction late xerostomia which includes xerostomia occurring 1 year after radiation reflects fibrosis of the salivary gland and as such is usually permanent. Xerostomia results in symptoms of dry mouth this affects the patient s ability to eat and speak. Additionally patients with xerostomia are at an increased risk for dental caries oral infections and osteonecrosis.

Radiotherapy is the primary treatment for patients with brain cancers. Independent of the modality with which the radiation is delivered to the brain medical therapy attacks or nuclear accidents the brain typically responds in a slow manner with severe clinical symptoms indicating brain cell death Fike et al. 1988 . While these problems are severe and may be fatal over a course of months less severe acute symptoms are also debilitating in the days to weeks following radiotherapy Mandell et al. 1990 .

The reasons for the death and or dysfunction of brain cells are not precisely known but are thought to arise from a variety of responses following the application of radiation. Ionizing radiation causes damage to living tissues through a series of molecular events depending on the radiation energy. Acute radiation damage is due to the aqueous free radicals generated by the action of radiation on water. The major free radicals resulting from aqueous radiolysis are OH. H. HO HO etc. Scholes 1983 Pradhan et al. 1973 Dragaric and Dragaric 1971 . These free radicals react with cellular macromolecules such as DNA RNA proteins and membranes and cause cell dysfunction that may ultimately lead to mortality. The radiation damage to a cell is potentiated or mitigated depending on several factors such as the presence of oxygen sulfhydryl compounds and other molecules in the cellular milieu Pradhan et al. 1973 Bacq 1965 . In the presence of oxygen hydrated electrons and H atoms react with molecular oxygen to produce radicals such as HO O apart from other aqueous free radicals Baraboi et al. 1994 Biakov and Stepanov 1997 .

Beyond the direct effects of radiation to generate radical species several reports document the release of cytokines in the brain following radiation treatment e.g. Girinsky et al. 1994 Hong et al. 1995 Chiang et al. 1997 . In particular Hong et al. 1995 report that mRNA for tumor necrosis factor alpha TNFa interleukin 1 alpha and beta IL1a and IL1b significantly increased in the brains of mice receiving a single 25 Gray Gy dose of brain irradiation a dose that translates to less that 10 mortality. To a lesser extent interleukin 6 IL6 is also induced in a dose dependent fashion with increasing radiation dose. Total body irradiation generated a similar pattern of cytokine induction but the levels of induction were much less than those seen with brain specific irradiation. These observed changes in cytokine levels following irradiation are consistent with the astrocytosis and microgliosis associated with the typical innate immune response that the brain mounts in response to disease and or invasion of pathogens. As reported in our recent publication Lynch et al. 2003 peripheral treatment with lipopolysaccharide LPS can also induce a brain inflammatory response which includes astrocytosis microgliosis and cytokine release similar to that seen by these authors with radiation treatments.

Three agents are currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA for chemotherapy and or radiotherapy protection dexrazoxane mesna and amifostine. However each of these approved agents has significant issues that limit their efficacy. Dexrazoxane and mesna each have relatively limited spectra of toxicity protection cardiac and urothelial respectively whereas amifostine has a broader potential cytoprotection spectrum. The good news is that these agents with the probable exception of mesna act systemically are not clearly targeted to one specific cell type and probably function to protect most cell types. Unlike myelosuppression or acute nausea vomiting measurement of the toxicities associated with these agents are more difficult or labor intensive to reproducibly assess in clinical trials because of outcome subjectivity neurotoxicity latent onset cardiomyopathy or unclear clinical relevance asymptomatic increases in serum creatinine microscopic hematuria or asymptomatic decreases in cardiac ejection fraction Hensley et al. 1999 .

Amifostine formerly known as WR 2721 and whose active metabolite is an aminothiol can protect cells from damage by scavenging oxygen derived free radicals. This drug arose from a classified nuclear warfare project sponsored by the United States Army and was ultimately selected from a group of more than 4 400 chemicals screened because of its superior radioprotective properties and safety profile Schucter and Glick 1993 . Subsequently amifostine was evaluated for its potential role in reducing the toxicity of radiation therapy and of chemotherapeutic agents that alter the structure and function of DNA such as alkylating agents and platinum agents. Unlike dexrazoxane and mesna for which the protective effects are directed against specific organs amifostine has been evaluated as a broad spectrum cytoprotective agent. A profile emerged from preclinical studies that demonstrated the ability of amifostine to selectively protect almost all normal tissues except the central nervous system CNS and neoplastic tissues from the cytotoxic effects of radiation therapy Schucter and Glick 1993 Coleman et al. 1988 . Accordingly there remains a significant need for effective treatments to reduce the effects of radiation and radiotherapy particularly in the brain and CNS.

Inflammatory bowel disease IBD also known as Crohn s Disease or ulcerative colitis affects approximately 1 million Americans with inflammation of the intestines abdominal pain cramping and diarrhea. These symptoms vary in severity but are often debilitating for patients to the extent that they greatly alter their quality of life. There are a wide array of therapies available with nearly all patients requiring a combination of treatment modalities depending on the severity of disease. These treatments however are often very expensive as is the case with infliximab anti TNF monoclonal antibody and typically display major unwanted side effects such as seen with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants that include risk of infections or malignancies diabetes pancreatitis and severe bone loss. In addition to these problems the extensive morbidity faced by IBD patients is a clear driving factor for continued efforts to develop new and effective therapies. Although apoE appears to have beneficial effects in innate immunity as evidenced by loss of innate immunity to systemic infection and exacerbation of sepsis and inflammation in apoE deficient mice the role of apoE in intestinal inflammation remains completely unexplored.

The present invention provides analogs and derivatives of COG133 a truncated peptide comprised of residues 133 149 of apoE. This truncated apoE peptide referred to as COG133 LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL SEQ. ID. NO.1 proved useful in treating or reducing cerebral ischemia or cerebral inflammation. U.S. application Ser. No. 10 252 120 filed Sep. 23 2002 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In an animal model however COG133 is most effective when administered immediately following TBI. The compounds of the present invention provide a wider therapeutic window for the treatment and prevention of neurological effects of traumatic brain injury. Therapeutic window refers to the time period during which the compounds of the invention can be effectively administered following TBI. By increasing the therapeutic window the compounds of the present invention can be administered at greater time intervals following TBI and effectively treat or prevent neurological effects of TBI decrease cerebral inflammation or ischemia or improve cognitive function following TBI. In addition the compounds of the present invention provide enhanced efficacy a greater therapeutic index and a longer therapeutic window for the treatment and prevention of neurological effects of traumatic brain injury.

The present invention also provides methods for the use of the compounds described above. For instance the compounds of the present invention can be used for the treatment of central nervous system CNS disorders and injuries including traumatic brain injury Alzheimer s cerebral ischemia cerebral edema or the reduction of glial or microglial activation. The present invention also provides methods for the amelioration of symptoms associated with CNS trauma inflammation or cerebral ischemia. In one embodiment the present invention provides methods for reducing neuronal cell death or suppressing macrophage activation.

In treating CNS disorders and injuries the blood brain barrier BBB drastically limits the transport of polar molecules such as peptides into the brain. Preliminary data in vivo indicate that the efficacy of COG133 and other ApoE peptide mimetics can be significantly improved by conjugation to a protein transduction domain PTD . PTDs are short basic peptides that promote the intracellular delivery of cargo that would otherwise fail to or only minimally traverse the cell membrane. However the ability of a PTD to transport cargo intracellularly does not guarantee it is capable of transport through the BBB which is significantly more complex of a process and the number of PTDs tested for the transport of cargo across the BBB in vivo has been relatively few. Therefore the appropriate PTD for BBB transport needs to be determined empirically and or created by modifications of known PTDs. The present invention provides compounds comprising PTD conjugations of apoE analogs and derivatives including COG133 and derivatives and analogs thereof.

Without being bound to any theory there is evidence to support at least two distinct mechanisms for apoE action in the injured brain glial modulation and neuroprotection. The brain has a limited repertoire of responses to acute and chronic injury. Glial activation with subsequent release of reactive oxygen species ROS glutamate proteases and inflammatory cytokines is believed to contribute to neuronal injury in both neurodegenerative processes such as those observed in Alzheimer s Disease AD and in acute brain injury. Applicants have recently demonstrated that apoE downregulates glial activation release of nitric oxide NO and release of inflammatory cytokines in mixed glial cultures and in purified microglial cultures following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide LPS See Laskowitz et al. 1997 . These in vitro observations appear to be biologically relevant as the expression of inflammatory genes is significantly upregulated in the brains of apoE deficient mice injected with LPS or subjected to closed head injury when compared to matched controls expressing mouse apoE protein Lynch et al. 2001 . The association between apoE and modulation of glial activation and inflammatory cytokine release is particularly intriguing in light of a recent report suggesting that apoE induces a signaling response in macrophages which are closely related to the brain specific macrophages known as microglia Misra et al. 2001 . Further evidence of an apoE glial activation association is provided by clinical observations that progression of disability in multiple sclerosis appears to depend upon the particular apoE isoform that the patient expresses Chapman et al. 1999 .

Another mechanism by which apoE may play a role in neurological disease is by exerting direct neuroprotective effects. A growing body of evidence implicates an isoform specific role for apoE in promoting neurite outgrowth Nathan et al. 1994 Bellosta et al. 1995 Holtzman et al. 1995 protecting against oxidative stress Hayek et al. 1994 Miyata and Smith 1996 Matthews and Beal 1996 and interacting with growth factors Gutman et al. 1997 to promote neuronal survival. Applicants recently demonstrated that apoE exerts neuroprotective effects on primary neuronal cultures in bioassays of glutamate induced excitotoxicity and oxidative stress which are consistent with the protective effects of apoE seen in murine models of focal and global ischemia Sheng et al. 1998a 1999b . Misra et al. 2001 along with others have recently demonstrated that apoE initiates a calcium dependent signaling cascade in neurons. Thus one possibility is that these neuroprotective effects are related to the ability of apoE to induce a signaling cascade in neurons Muller et al. 1998 Misra et al. 2001 .

A large number of analogs of the apoE 130 150 peptide were previously created and their activity tested in a cell based assay for suppression of release of inflammatory cytokines and free radicals and in receptor binding assays. Lynch et al. 2003278 4 48529 33 and U.S. application Ser. Nos. 10 252 120 filed Sep. 23 2002 09 957 909 filed Sep. 21 2001 and 09 260 430 filed Mar. 1 1999 now abandoned which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 077 551 filed Mar. 11 1998 the contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The present invention provides analogs and derivatives of COG133 a small peptide comprised of residues 133 149 of apoE. This apoE peptide referred to as COG133 LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL SEQ. ID. NO.1 proved useful in treating or reducing cerebral ischemia or cerebral inflammation. U.S. application Ser. No. 10 252 120 filed Sep. 23 2002 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In an animal model however COG133 is most effective when administered within 30 minutes immediately following TBI. The present invention provides analogs and derivatives of COG133 including amino acid substitution derivatives peptide mimetics and fusion protein conjugates that provide a wider therapeutic window and wider therapeutic index for the treatment and prevention of neurological effects of traumatic brain injury.

Therapeutic window refers to the time period during which the compounds of the invention can be effectively administered following TBI. By increasing the therapeutic window the compounds of the present invention can be administered at greater time intervals following TBI and effectively treat or prevent neurological effects of TBI decrease cerebral inflammation or ischemia or improve cognitive function following TBI. The compounds of the present invention their analogs and derivatives also provide a wider therapeutic index than COG133. Therapeutic index refers to the maximum tolerated dose at which no animal dies divided by the minimal effective dose at which performance after injury is significantly better than saline controls. The compounds of the present invention provide increased CNS penetration or increase the therapeutic window for the treatment and prevention of neurological effects of traumatic brain injury. CNS penetration refers to the ability of a compound including a peptide to cross the blood brain barrier and enter the Central Nervous System CNS .

Without being bound to any theory it is hypothesized that PTDs can enhance CNS penetration of compounds including apoE analog peptides. By increasing CNS penetration the PTD apoE analog conjugated compounds described herein can increase the efficacy of the apoE analogs and extend the therapeutic window i.e. length of time between brain injury and efficacious administration of the apoE analogs including COG133. Preliminary data indicate that COG133 was neuroprotective when administered up to 30 minutes post TBI whereas a PTD COG133 conjugate was equally effective when administered up to 150 minutes following TBI. This represents a substantial increase in the therapeutic window that could dramatically expand the number of patients that can be helped by this novel therapeutic compound. Furthermore enhancing the BBB penetrability of the apoE analogs including COG133 can render these compounds useful for the treatment prevention or amelioration of numerous inflammation based neurodegenerative diseases regardless of whether the BBB is compromised.

The PTD conjugates of the invention also provide the added benefit of lowering the amount of drug COG133 needed to be administered because of specific targeting to the brain. This provides a better therapeutic index for the conjugated compounds which is the maximum tolerated dose of compound when no death is seen divided by the minimum effective dose of compound needed to be given to see the desired protective effect. The greater the index the safer a compound should be because the side effect profile should be decreased at the concentration needed to see the desired protective effect. Different PTD s could be made to preferentially target other specific tissues and or organs depending on the disorder to be treated.

In one embodiment the present invention provides compounds for the methods described below. In one aspect the invention provides compounds that are ApoE analogs. In one aspect the invention provides compounds that are a helical peptides. In preferred embodiments the compounds are analogs and derivatives of COG133 a peptide of the sequence LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL SEQ. ID. NO.1 . In more preferred embodiments the present invention provides peptide compounds containing a sequence selected from the group consisting of 

The present invention provides protein transduction domains PTD conjugated to an apoE analog. PTDs are heterogeneous in size and lack sequence homology although most share a positive charge and are amphipathic. The PTDs of the present invention are those that facilitate CNS penetration or facilitate intracellular transport. In certain embodiments PTDs can be antimicrobial peptides such as protegrin 1 Bactenecin 7 Buforin and Maginin a host of arginine rich RNA and DNA binding peptides e.g. HIV 1 transactivating protein TAT and homeodomain transcription factor Antennapedia a.k.a. Penetratin chimeric PTDs such as Transportan lysine and arginine rich peptides derived from phage display libraries polyarginine and most recently homolysine oligomers See Fisher et al. 2001 Lindsay 2002 Tung et al. 2003 Leifert et al. 2003 Bogoyevitch et al. 2002 Garcia Echeverria 2003 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . In certain embodiments the PTDs are addition reverso retro inverso and enantio forms of many of the PTDs described herein.

In a preferred embodiment the present invention provides PTD conjugates selected from the group consisting of 

In certain embodiments the PTD conjugate is RGGRLAYLRRRWAVLGR SEQ. ID. NO. 55 referred to as SynB5 or RRLSYSRRRF SEQ ID NO. 54 referred to as SynB3. PTD apoE conjugate compounds of the invention include for instance SynB5 COG133 SynB3 COG133 or SynB5 and Syn B3 conjugates of any of the COG133 analogs described herein. Accordingly PTD transport was initially characterized as receptor and energy independent nonendocytic and lacking in cell specificity. However these data were collected through analysis of cellular uptake via fluorescence microscopy on fixed cells or flow cytometry. Several groups have recently demonstrated that data collected in this manner was subject to an artifact of cell fixation Futaki 2002 Vives et al. 2003 Suzuki 2001 Richard et al. 2003 Lundberg et al. 2002 Thoren et al. 2003 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . It is becoming clear that a number of these PTDs e.g. penetratin TAT poly arginine are taken up via endocytosis Drin et al. 2003 Thoren et al. 2003 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . The same methodology was also used for analysis of structure activity relationships of PTDs. The validity of the results of these studies as well as studies of cell specificity which were also derived from fixed cells is therefore called into question. For example the uptake of penetratin in living cells was recently demonstrated to be endocytic. Furthermore substitution of two tryptophan residues previously identified as critical for transcytosis did not modify the uptake of penetratin Thoren et al. 2003 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . Questions regarding mechanism of transport aside there are numerous reports of the biological effects of cargo carried by PTDs including peptides proteins peptide nucleic acids oligonucleotides liposomes and magnetic nanoparticles substantiating their capability for translocation Schwarze et al 2000 Bogoyevitch et al. 2002 Tung et al. 2003 Vives et al. 2003 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . It is becoming clear that our knowledge regarding PTDs needs to be re evaluated and that transport mechanisms likely vary among the PTDs perhaps as their primary structures also vary.

Comparative studies indicated that PTDs are not interchangeable they differ in uptake rate concentration required for translocation toxicity and cellular context Thoren et al. 2003 Suzuki et al. 2002 Mai et al. 2002 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . Studies using live cells have reported that a PTD can have multiple modes of transport which can differ according to cellular context Drin et al. 2003 Futaki 2002 Leifert et al. 2003 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . Recent data indicate that PTDs exhibit cell specificity the source of which can be preferential interaction of PTDs with specific cell surface glycosaminoglycans Mai et al. 2002 Console et al. 2003 Koppelhus et al. 2002 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . Evidence to this effect comes from studies that show dextran sulfate inhibited uptake of TAT but not penetratin complexes and heparin inhibited internalization of TAT and penetratin complexes to different degrees Console et al. 2003 incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . These data suggest selectively targeting tissues may be possible by optimizing the PTD to target specific cell surface expressed glycosaminoglycans. Clearly there is no PTD that is optimal for cargo delivery across the board. PTD cargo and target organ all must be taken into account.

In one aspect the compounds are analogs or peptide mimetics of an apoE protein. In yet another preferred embodiment the peptide is AcASHLRKLAibKRLL SEQ. ID. NO. 6 COG432 . In another preferred embodiment the peptide is Ac AS Aib LRKL Aib KRLL NH SEQ. ID. NO. 7 COG1410 . COG1410 in particular exhibits a 4 fold gain in therapeutic window and a 7.4 fold gain in Therapeutic Index as compared to COG133. In certain embodiments the present invention provides peptide mimetics that mimic the functionality of the active peptide and methods of making the same as described in detail hereinbelow.

Such molecules are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6 762 169 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Small molecules that target the conjugate to specific cells or tissues may also be used. It is known that presence of a biotin avidin complex increases uptake of such modified peptides across endothelial cells. Linkage of peptides to carbohydrate moieties for example to a glycoside through a serine residue on the peptide to form a O linked glycoside enhances transport of the glycoside derivative via glucose transporters Polt R. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 7144 7118 1994 Oh et al. Drug Transport and targeting In Membrane Transporters as Drug Targets Amidon G. L. and Sadee W. eds. pg 59 88 Plenum Press New York 1999 .

The peptides may have attached various label moieties such as radioactive labels and fluorescent labels for detection and tracing. Fluorescent labels include but are not limited to fluorescein eosin Alexa Fluor Oregon Green rhodamine Green tetramethylrhodamine rhodamine Red Texas Red coumarin and NBD fluorophores the QSY 7 dabcyl and dabsyl chromophores BODIPY Cy.sup.5 etc.

In another aspect other naturally occurring or synthetic peptides and proteins may be used to provide a carrier immunogen for generating antibodies to the subject peptides where the antibodies serve as reagents for detecting the immunomodulatory peptides or for identifying other peptides having a comparable conformation. Suitable carriers for generating antibodies include among others hemocyanins e.g. Keyhole Limpet hemocyanin KLH albumins e.g. bovine serum albumin ovalbumin human serum albumin etc. immunoglobulins thyroglobulins e.g. bovine thyroglobulin toxins e.g. diptheria toxoid tetanus toxoid and polypeptides such as polylysine or polyalanine lysine. Although proteins are preferred carriers other carriers preferably high molecular weight compounds may be used including carbohydrates polysaccharides lipopolysaccharides nucleic acids and the like of sufficient size and immunogenicity. In addition the resulting antibodies may be used to prepare anti idiotypic antibodies which may compete with the subject peptides for binding to a target site. These anti idiotypic antibodies are useful for identifying proteins to which the subject peptides bind.

Another variation of the therapeutic peptides of the present invention is the linking of from one to fifteen amino acids or analogs to the N terminal or C terminal amino acid of the therapeutic peptide. Analogs of the peptides of the present invention can also be prepared by adding from one to fifteen additional amino acids to the N terminal C terminal or both N and C terminals of an active peptide where such amino acid additions do not adversely affect the ability of the peptide to bind to receptors at the site bound by a peptides of the invention.

The peptides of the present invention further include conservative variants of the peptides herein described. As used herein a conservative variant refers to alterations in the amino acid sequence that do not adversely affect the biological functions of the peptide. A substitution insertion or deletion is said to adversely affect the peptide when the altered sequence prevents or disrupts a biological function associated with the peptide. For example the overall charge structure or hydrophobic hydrophilic properties of the peptide may be altered without adversely affecting a biological activity. Accordingly the amino acid sequence can be altered for example to render the peptide more hydrophobic or hydrophilic without adversely affecting the biological activities of the peptide.

Ordinarily the conservative substitution variants analogs and derivatives of the peptides will have an amino acid sequence identity to the disclosed sequences SEQ ID NOs 1 56 of at least about 55 at least about 65 at least about 75 at least about 80 at least about 85 at least about 90 at least about 95 or at least about 96 to 99 . Identity or homology with respect to such sequences is defined herein as the percentage of amino acid residues in the candidate sequence that are identical with the known peptides after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent homology and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. N terminal C terminal or internal extensions deletions or insertions into the peptide sequence shall not be construed as affecting homology.

Thus the peptides of the present invention include molecules having the amino acid sequence disclosed in SEQ ID Nos. 1 56 fragments thereof having a consecutive sequence of at least about 3 4 5 6 10 15 or more amino acid residues of the therapeutic peptide amino acid sequence variants of such peptides wherein an amino acid residue has been inserted N or C terminal to or within the disclosed sequence and amino acid sequence variants of the disclosed sequence or their fragments as defined above that have been substituted by another residue. Peptide compounds comprising the peptide sequences of the invention may be 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 or more amino acids. Contemplated variants further include those containing predetermined mutations by e.g. homologous recombination site directed or PCR mutagenesis and the corresponding peptides of other animal species including but not limited to rabbit rat porcine bovine ovine equine and non human primate species and derivatives wherein the peptide has been covalently modified by substitution chemical enzymatic or other appropriate means with a moiety other than a naturally occurring amino acid for example a detectable moiety such as an enzyme or radioisotope .

Therapeutic peptides of the present invention can be in free form or the form of a salt where the salt is pharmaceutically acceptable. These include inorganic salts of sodium potassium lithium ammonium calcium magnesium iron zinc copper manganese and the like. Various organic salts of the peptide may also be made with including but not limited to acetic acid propionic acid pyruvic acid maleic acid succinic acid tartaric acid citric acid benozic acid cinnamic acid salicylic acid etc.

It was previously found that COG133 peptide significantly suppresses neuronal cell death and calcium influx associated with N methyl D aspartate exposure. U.S. application Ser. No. 10 252 120 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Thus the peptides of the present invention provide the basis for improved therapeutic compositions for treating diseases associated with NMDA excitotoxicity. For instance NMDA excitotoxicity has been associated with HIV dementia and encephalopy Perez et al. 2001 Haughey et al. 2001 Doble 1999 .

NMDA excitotoxicity has also been associated with neurolathyrism amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS Doble 1999 Nguimfack 2002 schizophrenia Huntington s chorea Parkinson s Nguimfack 2002 Mytilineou et al. 1997 Klopman and Sedykh 2002 Le and Lipton 2001 bipolar disorder Farber et al. 2002 multiple sclerosis in humans and experimental autoimmune encephalitis EAE in animals Paul and Bolton 2002 depression stroke Le and Lipton 2001 epilepsy and the inherited neurometabolic disease d 2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria Kolker et al. 2002 in addition to Alzheimer s Disease Bi et al. 2002 Bi and Sze 2002 and traumatic brain injury Rao et al. 2001 Regner et al. 2001 Xu and Luo 2001 . NMDA antagonists are also used in clinical anesthesia Farber et al. 2002 and have been shown to inhibit chronic pain McKenna and Melzack 2001 Le and Lipton 2001 drug tolerance Cady 2001 and alcohol dependency in an animal model Kotlinska 2001 .

Thus the present invention includes the use of the disclosed peptides and peptide mimetics in methods and pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of any of the above diseases or disorders and in combined therapeutic compositions containing other known compounds useful for treating the various disorders. For instance the peptides and other compounds of the invention can be combined with any known HIV drug including HIV reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors in a combined therapeutic regimen geared toward inhibiting viral replication and preventing or treating HIV dementia or can be administered alone or with other NMDA antagonists in a supplementary formulation. One author recently commented that even though antiretroviral therapy of the CNS is essential for improvement in function and prognosis in patients demonstrating AIDS dementia complex it may also be necessary in the long term to provide additional neuroprotection blocking secondary mechanisms of neurotoxicity since a significant portion of toxicity seems to be mediated by indirect mechanisms that continue even during antiretroviral therapy Clifford 2002 .

In one embodiment the peptides can be combined with an anti atherosclerotic drug including HMG CoA reductase inhibitors also termed statins. Suitable statins for use in the methods of the invention include for example lovastatin MEVACOR Merck simvastatin ZOCOR Merck pravastatin PRAVACHOL Bristol Myers Squibb rosuvastatin CRESTOR AstraZeneca fluvastatin LESCOL Novartis and atorvastatin LIPITOR Warner Lambert .

Riluzole RILUTEK Rhone Poulenc is a substance with glutamate antagonistic properties that is used for neuroprotective treatment in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and which is currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of Huntington s disease and Parkinson s disease Schiefer et al. 2002 Doble 1999 . Schiefer and colleagues recently demonstrated that riluzole prolongs survival time and alters nuclear inclusion formation in a transgenic mouse model of Huntington s disease. Thus given the NMDA antagonistic role of the peptides and compounds of the invention these peptides and compounds could be used in pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of ALS Huntington s and Parkinson s alone or in combination with other glutamate antagonists such as riluzole.

L deprenyl is an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase MAO B that delays the emergence of disability and the progression of signs and symptoms of Parkinson s disease and is predicted to exert a protective effect from events occurring downstream from activation of glutamate receptors Mytilineou et al. 1997 . MAO B inhibitors dopamine receptor antagonists such as levodopa and NMDA receptor antagonists have all been shown to have an antiparkinson effect and multidrug combinations have been shown to synergistically enhance the antiparkinson effects of the drugs Klopman and Sedykh 2002 . Thus given the NMDA antagonistic role of the peptides and compounds of the invention these peptides and compounds could be used in pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of Parkinson s alone or in combination with other NMDA receptor antagonists MAO B inhibitors such as L deprenyl and dopamine receptor antagonists such as levodopa.

The production of free radicals as a result of glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia Nguimfack 2002 . Thus researchers have begun to examine treatment of schizophrenia with antioxidizing substances used in other neurological diseases such as ALS Parkinson s and Huntington s disease. Given that the NMDA receptor antagonistic peptides and compounds of the invention can be used to inhibit the production of free radicals as a result of glutamate excitotoxicity these peptides and compounds can be used in pharmaceutical formulations for the treatment of schizophrenia alone or in combination with other antioxidizing substances.

Anticonvulsant antiepileptic agents that inhibit NMDA receptor hypofunction have found to be of clinical use in bipolar disorder Farber et al. 2002 . Such agents include phenyloin DILANTIN Pfizer carbamazepine TEGRETOL Novartis valproic acid DEPAKOTE Abbott lamotrigine LAMICTAL GlaxoSmithKline riluzole RILUTEK Rhone Poulenc tetrodotoxin felbamate FELBATOL Wallace gabapentin NEURONTIN Pfizer and ethosuximide ZARONTIN Pfizer . Given that the peptides of the compounds of the present invention also inhibit NMDA receptor associated neurotoxicity the peptides and compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other NMDA receptor antagonists or inhibitors of NMDA receptor hypofunction in pharmaceuticals and methods of treating bipolar disorder or epilepsy.

Multiple sclerosis MS is an immunologically mediated disease as determined by observation of the response to immunotherapy and the existence of an animal model experimental autoimmune encephalitis EAE . See for example Mix et al. 2004151 1 2 158 70 Anderson et al. 200455 5 654 9 and Ni et al. 200410 2 158 64. Interferon IFN beta 1b IFN beta 1a and glatiramer acetate COPAXONE Teva current therapies used for relapsing or remitting MS have mechanisms of action that address the immunologic pathophysiology of MS Dhib Jalbut 2002 . For instance the interferons bind to cell surface specific receptors initiating a cascade of signaling pathways that end with the secretion of antiviral antiproliferative and immunomodulatory gene products. Glatiramer acetate a synthetic molecule inhibits the activation of myelin basic protein reactive T cells and induces a T cell repertoire characterized by anti inflammatory effects. Several currently marketed treatments including IV immunoglobulin GAMAGARD Baxter methotrexate RHEUMATREX American Cyanamid and azathioprine IMURAN GlaxoSmithKline are being evaluated as treatments for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in combination with the approved therapies Calabresi 2002 . Given that the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine NAMENDA Merz has been shown to prevent the breakdown of and restore the blood brain barrier and reduce symptoms associated with pathogenesis of EAE in vivo Paul and Bolton 2002 the peptides and compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other NMDA receptor antagonists or in addition to interferons or glatiramer acetate for the treatment of MS in humans.

Using an animal model of persistent human pain McKenna and Melzack recently showed that pain behavior was significantly reduced by treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 McKenna and Melzack 2001 . Similarly Von Bergen and colleagues recently demonstrated that intrathecal administration of LY293558 a competitive non N methyl D aspartate excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist blocked both sensory and motor responses in rats through 180 min. with complete recovery observed the following day. The effects of LY293558 were more pronounced and sustained than those of bupivacaine leading the authors to conclude that drugs like LY293558 that block glutamate receptors can be an alternative to local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia in humans Von Bergen et al. 2002 . Thus the peptides and compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other NMDA receptor antagonists or in addition to other anesthetic compounds as local anesthetics in humans and animals.

NMDA receptors are also believed to play a major role in the pathophysiology of substance use Kotlinska 2001 Soyka et al. 2000 . For instance Kotlinska showed that the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine given prior to ethanol administration prevented the development of ethanol dependence in rats. Jones and colleagues demonstrated that the intensity of morphine withdrawal syndrome was reduced in rat pups pre treated with the NMDA receptor antagonist LY235959. Withdrawal behaviors such as head moves moving paws rolling and walking were decreased and vocalizations were completely eliminated in pups pre treated with LY2359559 Jones et al. 2002 . According to a recent review strategies aimed at targeting the basic mechanisms of addiction rely on the premise that addiction is caused by adaptive changes in the central nervous system and that craving which is the main cause of relapse depends on dopaminergic mechanisms and requires high general excitability. Thus pharmacological approaches have involved drugs that reduce neuronal adaptability by inhibiting the calcium entry to neurons both through voltage gated channels e.g. nimodipine and NMDA receptors e.g. memantine as well as drugs that stimulate the inhibitory GABAergic system gamma vinyl GABA baclofen . Thus the peptides and compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other NMDA receptor antagonists such as memantine or in addition to other neuronal adaptability compounds such as nimodipine gamma vinyl GABA and baclofen in compositions and methods for the prevention and treatment of alcohol and drug addiction in humans.

Rao et al. reported neuroprotection by memantine after traumatic brain injury in rats Rao et al. 2001 . Other authors recently commented that excessive activation of NMDA receptors can be one of the most important factors to induce secondary cerebral impairments and NMDA receptor antagonists such as AP5 can protect the brain from edema after brain injury. Thus the peptides and compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other NMDA receptor antagonists in compositions and methods for the treatment of brain injury and associated secondary cerebral impairments in humans and animals.

Statins have been shown to be effective in treating patients with head trauma and in reducing inflammation associated with head trauma and Alzheimers Disease. For instance as reported by McGirt et al. 2002 Stroke December 2002 simvastatin treatment was shown to reduce vasospasm and improve functional outcomes in a murine model of subarachnoid hemorrhage SAH . Further studies have shown that pretreatment with atorvastatin has similar protective effects suggesting a role for statins as a class of agents effective in improving outcomes in SAH and closed head injury. Thus the peptides and compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with one or more statin agents in compositions and methods for the treatment of brain injury and associated secondary cerebral impairments in humans and animals including simvastatin and or atorvastatin.

New therapies for arthritis include peptides and proteins that bind with tumor necrosis factor. Etanercept ENBREL Amgen is a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand binding portion of the human 75 kd tumor necrosis factor receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Adalimumab HUMIRA Abbott is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Tumor necrosis factor binding proteins have shown outstanding results in slowing the progression and lessening the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. Thus the peptides and compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other drug for the treatment of rheumatic diseases including for example rheumatoid arthritis ankylosing spondylitis polyarticular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis.

The present methods and compounds are useful in preventing treating or ameliorating neurological signs and symptoms associated with acute CNS injury. As used herein acute CNS injury includes but is not limited to stroke caused by thrombosis embolism or vasoconstriction closed head injury global cerebral ischemia e.g. ischemia due to systemic hypotension of any cause including cardiac infarction cardiac arrhythmia hemorrhagic shock and post coronary artery bypass graft brain injury focal ischemia and intracranial hemorrhage. Ischemic damage to the central nervous system can result from either global or focal ischemic conditions. Global ischemia occurs where blood flow to the entire brain ceases for a period of time such as during cardiac arrest. Focal ischemia occurs when a portion of the brain is deprived of normal blood flow such as during thromboembolytic occlusion of a cerebral vessel traumatic head injury edema and brain tumors. Much of the CNS damage due to cerebral ischemia occurs during the hours or even days following the ischemic condition and is secondary to the release of cytotoxic products by damaged tissue.

In certain embodiments the methods of the present invention provide for use of the compounds before during or contemporaneously with coronary artery bypass graft CABG surgery. According to a study performed at Duke University published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2001 a substantial proportion of patients after coronary artery bypass surgery experience a measurable impairment in their mental capabilities called the pumphead phenomenon. According to this study 42 of patients tested had at least a 20 drop in test scores after surgery. Further the decrease in cognitive capacity persisted for 5 years.

The present methods and compounds are also useful in preventing treating or ameliorating neurological signs and symptoms associated with chronic neurological disease including but not limited to Alzheimer s disease AD and HIV associated encephalopathy. The finding by the present inventors that ApoE peptides can be used to suppress glial activation provides a role for the peptides and compounds of the invention in the treatment of any neurological disease involving microglial activation. For example microglia express markers of activation in AD suggesting that crucial inflammatory events in AD involve microglia. Such activated microglia cluster near amyloid plaques Griffin et al. 1995 . Microglia are also activated in epilepsy Sheng et al. 1994 .

It has been recently shown that uptake and pathogenic effects of amyloid beta peptide are blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists Bi et al. 2002 . Other studies indicate that anti inflammatory drugs can delay the onset or progression of AD Breitner et al. 1995 Rogers et al. 1993 . Thus the peptides and compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other NMDA receptor antagonists or other known pharmaceuticals and especially anti inflammatory drugs used for the treatment of AD in compositions and methods for the treatment of AD in humans.

The present methods and compounds are also useful in preventing treating or ameliorating the neurological signs and symptoms associated with inflammatory conditions affecting the nervous system including the CNS including but not limited to multiple sclerosis vasculitis acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and Guillain Barre syndrome. In this regard the ApoE peptides and other compounds of the invention can be used alone or in combination with other known anti inflammatory drugs or cytokines to formulate pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of CNS inflammatory conditions.

The present methods and compounds are useful in preventing suppressing or reducing the activation of glia in the CNS that occurs as a part of acute or chronic CNS disease. The effect of the present methods and compounds can be assessed at the cellular or tissue level e.g. histologically or morphometrically or by assessing a subject s neurological status. The suppression or reduction of glial activation can be assessed by various methods as would be apparent to those in the art one such method is to measure the production or presence of compounds that are known to be produced by activated glia and compare such measurements to levels of the same compounds in control situations. Alternatively the effects of the present methods and compounds in suppressing reducing or preventing microglial activation can be assessed by comparing the signs and or symptoms of CNS disease in treated and control subjects where such signs and or symptoms are associated with or secondary to activation of microglia.

ApoE receptor binding peptides have also been shown to protect against LPS induced production of cytokines in the periphery in an in vivo animal model of sepsis. U.S. application Ser. No. 10 252 120 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Thus the peptides and compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other known anti inflammatory cytokines and antibodies in compositions and methods for the treatment of sepsis.

As used herein the terms treating and ameliorating are not necessarily meant to indicate a reversal or cessation of the disease process underlying the CNS or sepsis condition afflicting the subject being treated. Such terms indicate that the deleterious signs and or symptoms associated with the condition being treated are lessened or reduced or the rate of progression is reduced compared to that which would occur in the absence of treatment. A change in a disease sign or symptom can be assessed at the level of the subject e.g. the function or condition of the subject is assessed or at a tissue or cellular level e.g. the production of markers of glial or macrophage activation is lessened or reduced . Where the methods of the present invention are used to treat chronic CNS conditions such as Alzheimer s disease the methods can slow or delay the onset of symptoms such as dementia while not necessarily affecting or reversing the underlying disease process.

It is known that the inflammatory process mediates an aspect of the atherosclerotic process. See e.g. Hansson 1994 Berliner et al. 1995 Watanabe et al. 1997 . ApoE is known to be secreted by macrophages locally at blood vessel walls although the amount secreted by macrophages in an individual is trivial compared to the amount of ApoE produced by the liver . In the classic model of atherosclerosis ApoE functions to remove cholesterol from the blood stream and deliver it to macrophages or to the liver. However it has become apparent that ApoE secreted by macrophages at the blood vessel wall decreases atherosclerotic plaque formation independent of any lipid metabolism effects. For instance ApoE deficient mice are accepted as a model of hypercholesteremia and atherosclerotic disease. Providing ApoE secreting macrophages to such mice dramatically decreases atherosclerotic plaque formation. Linton et al. 1995 . Conversely replacing a wild type mouse s macrophages with ApoE deficient macrophages accelerates atherosclerotic changes even though the animal continues to produce ApoE by the liver. Fazio et al. 1997 .

In atherosclerosis it is hypothesized that ApoE via a receptor mediated event downregulates macrophage activation in the vicinity of blood vessel walls. Such down regulation of macrophage activation interrupts or interferes with the cascade of events associated with atherosclerotic plaque formation to thereby reduce or slow the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. The cascade of events known to be associated with atherosclerosis includes smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell proliferation and foam cell formation. Evidence exists that ApoE downregulates each of these processes. ApoE thus affects the presence and progression of atherosclerosis in vivo independent of its effects on lipids. The progression of atherosclerosis can be assessed by measuring the amount or size of atherosclerotic plaques or the percentage of the blood vessel blocked by an atherosclerotic lesion or the rate of growth of such plaques.

It has been shown that ApoE transduces a calcium mediated signal Ca inositol triphosphate signal transduction in macrophage indicating that ApoE modifies macrophage function by downregulating macrophage activation and therefore subsequent inflammation. Peptides compounds methods and pharmaceutical formulations as described herein in relation to microglia and CNS disease are accordingly useful in methods of suppressing the activation of macrophages to suppress prevent or slow atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerosis refers to the thickening of the arterial intima and accumulation of lipid in artherosclerotic plaques. Administration of compounds of the present invention to treat or prevent atherosclerosis can be by any means discussed herein as well as other suitable methods that are known in the art. When using the present compounds to prevent slow or treat atherosclerotic changes it is apparent that they need not be formulated to pass through the blood brain barrier. Conditions that can be treated by the present method include atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries arteries supplying the Central Nervous System such as carotid arteries arteries of the peripheral circulation or the splanchnic circulation and renal artery disease. Administration such as parenteral administration can be site specific or into the general blood stream.

The present methods and compounds are also useful in protecting subjects from the damaging effects of radiation. Findings of increased brain inflammation following irradiation suggested to the present inventors that anti inflammatory treatment strategies may protect normal brain tissue from damage following irradiation. It has been reported that apoE deficient animals have an increased systemic inflammatory response and higher mortality following LPS injection and that the administration of exogenous apoE improves mortality by downregulating suppressing the inflammatory cascade Van Oosten et al. 1991 . Accordingly the present invention encompasses the administration of ApoE and particularly ApoE mimetic peptides to protect subjects from the damaging effects of radiation.

In particular the present invention encompasses methods for protecting a subject in need thereof against at least one effect of radiation comprising administering to said subject a protective dose of ApoE or at least one ApoE mimetic peptide. Preferred ApoE mimetic peptides include COG133 a peptide of the sequence LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL SEQ. ID. NO.1 and derivatives of COG133 as described herein.

Types of radiation exposure that may be addressed by the methods of the present invention include total body irradiation TBI for instance wherein said subject has undergone a transplantation procedure or more specifically a blood or bone marrow transplantation radiation therapy for instance of one or more specific organs during the treatment of cancer and environmental radiation exposure i.e. either accidental or intentional for instance as encountered in nuclear facilities or nuclear waste sites warfare acts of terrorism and laboratory or other work involving exposure to radiation. The methods of the invention may be performed before after or concurrently with the radiation exposure.

Where the radiation exposure is radiotherapy of cancer such cancers include any cancer susceptible to radiotherapy including but not limited to brain tumors head and neck cancers lung cancer breast cancer prostate cancer skin cancer rectal cancer cervix and uterine cancers lymphoma and sarcoma. Radiotherapy may be given by external beam irradiation or brachytherapy. The methods of the invention may be performed before after or concurrently with the radiotherapy.

For example in general the methods of the invention may be performed within minutes to hours after radiation exposure or within about 1 day about 2 days about 3 days about 4 days about 5 days about 6 days about 7 days about 10 days or about two to three weeks to one month after radiation exposure. In general ApoE and the peptides should be administered as soon after radiation exposure as possible for best results. Where the methods are performed so as to prevent or mitigate the effects of radiation exposure in a subject about to be exposed to or at risk of exposure to radiation the compounds of the invention can be administered at about 10 days about 7 days about 6 days about 5 days about 4 days about 3 days about 2 days or about 1 day prior to exposure or immediately prior to exposure e.g. within hours to minutes before exposure . Administration can then be continued after exposure as above.

As noted above the methods of the present invention protect a subject in need thereof against at least one effect of radiation. When given after the symptoms or effects of radiation exposure have developed the methods of the present invention may be used to treat or decrease at least one effect of radiation. As used herein the terms protect treat and decrease are not necessarily meant to indicate a reversal or cessation of the disease process accompanying or caused by the radiation exposure. Such terms indicate that the deleterious signs and or symptoms associated with the radiation exposure are lessened or reduced or the rate of progression is reduced compared to that which would occur in the absence of treatment. A change in a disease sign or symptom may be assessed at the level of the subject e.g. the function or condition of the subject is assessed or at a tissue or cellular level e.g. the production of markers of glial or macrophage activation is lessened or reduced . Where the methods of the present invention are used to treat radiation exposure the methods of the invention can slow or delay the onset of symptoms of radiation toxicity while not necessarily affecting or reversing the underlying disease process.

The effects of radiation exposure or TBI or radiotherapy according to the present invention include but are not limited to the radiation induced production of at least one cytokine. Such cytokines include among others cytokines selected from the group consisting of tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF transforming growth factor beta TGF interleukin 1 alpha IL1 interleukin 1 beta IL1 interleukin 6 IL6 and interleukin 12 IL12 . Changes in enzyme markers of leukocyte activation e.g. myeloperoxidase COX 2 expression iNOS expression etc. and cellular apoptosis e.g. DNA fragmentation caspase activation etc. are also included. Radiation induced effects also include but are not limited to behavioral effects xerostomia including acute and late xerostomia radiation induced neurotoxicity late delayed radiation induced brain necrosis radiation induced soft tissue or vascular injuries including among others injuries selected from the group consisting of skin atrophy radiation cystitis inflammation of the bladder proctitis inflammation of the rectum and anus and injury to the larynx leucopenia purpura hemorrhage hair loss diarrhea fever electrolyte disturbance convulsions ataxia tremors and lethargy. Radiation induced skin damage collectively termed radiation cutaneous syndrome may include acute skin reactions involving swelling desquamation ulceration and late cutaneous fibrosis including fistualla formation.

The present invention further provides a method of treating inflammatory bowel disease IBD Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis comprising administering to a subject in need thereof. ApoE protein or one or more ApoE mimetic peptides in an amount that reduces symptoms of IBD Crohn s disease or ulcerative colitis as compared to that which would occur in the absence of the protein. In practicing the methods of this invention the therapeutic peptides and or derivatives thereof may be used alone or in combination with other active ingredients. If desired one or more agents typically used to treat inflammatory bowel disease may be used as a substitute for or in addition to the therapeutic peptides in the methods and compositions of the invention. Such agents include biologics e.g. inflixamab adelimumab and CDP 870 small molecule immunomodulators e.g. VX 702 SCIO 469 doramapimod RO 30201195 SCIO 323 DPC 333 pranalcasan mycophenolate and merimepodib non steroidal immunophilin dependent immunosuppressants e.g. cyclosporine tacrolimus pimecrolimus and ISAtx247 5 amino salicylic acid e.g. mesalamine sulfasalazine balsalazide disodium and olsalazine sodium DMARDs e.g. methotrexate and azathioprine and alosetron. Thus in one embodiment the invention features the combination of a peptide compound comprising a sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 56 and any of the foregoing agents and methods of treating inflammatory bowel disease therewith.

Suitable subjects benefiting from the methods of the present invention include male and female mammalian subjects including humans non human primates and non primate mammals. Subjects include veterinary companion animal subjects as well as livestock and exotic species.

Preferably the compounds of the present invention are used in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The present invention thus also provides pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to a subject. Such compositions comprise an effective amount of the compound of the present invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier can be a liquid so that the composition is adapted for parenteral administration or can be solid i.e. a tablet or pill formulated for oral administration. Further the carrier can be in the form of a nebulizable liquid or solid so that the composition is adapted for inhalation. When administered parenterally the composition should be pyrogen free and in an acceptable parenteral carrier. Active compounds can alternatively be formulated encapsulated in liposomes using known methods. Additionally the intranasal administration of peptides to treat CNS conditions is known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 567 682 incorporated herein by reference to Pert regarding intranasal administration of peptide T to treat AD . Preparation of a compound of the present invention for intranasal administration can be carried out using techniques as are known in the art.

Nutritional supplements for the treatment of subjects having undergone radiation exposure are described in US application 20030105027 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention may also be used in combination with anti inflammatory cytokines growth factors or leukocyte migration inhibitory compounds. Useful cytokines include but are not limited to IL 4 IL 11 IL 11 and IL 13 particularly IL 4 and IL 10 which are known to suppress production of inflammatory cytokines and to be involved in restoring the immune system. Growth factors include GM CSF among others. These cytokines and growth factors may be administered as purified proteins obtained naturally or from recombinant sources or administered in the form of nucleic acids that express these peptides particularly as fusion proteins.

Pharmaceutical preparations of the compounds of the present invention can optionally include a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or excipient.

An effective amount of the compound of the present invention is that amount that decreases microglial activation compared to that which would occur in the absence of the compound in other words an amount that decreases the production of neurotoxic and neuromodulatory compounds by the microglia compared to that which would occur in the absence of the compound. Neuromodulatory refers to a non lethal alteration in neuron function. The effective amount and the manner of administration will be determined on an individual basis and will be based on the specific therapeutic molecule being used and a consideration of the subject size age general health the condition being treated AD acute head injury cerebral inflammation etc. the severity of the symptoms to be treated the result sought the specific carrier or pharmaceutical formulation being used the route of administration and other factors as would be apparent to those skilled in the art.

The blood brain barrier presents a barrier to the passive diffusion of substances from the bloodstream into various regions of the CNS. However active transport of certain agents is known to occur in either direction across the blood brain barrier. Substances that can have limited access to the brain from the bloodstream can be injected directly into the cerebrospinal fluid. Cerebral ischemia and inflammation are also known to modify the blood brain barrier and result in increased access to substances in the bloodstream.

Administration of a compound directly to the brain is known in the art. Intrathecal injection administers agents directly to the brain ventricles and the spinal fluid. Surgically implantable infusion pumps are available to provide sustained administration of agents directly into the spinal fluid. Lumbar puncture with injection of a pharmaceutical compound into the cerebrospinal fluid spinal injection is known in the art and is suited for administration of the present compounds. Use of PTD domains as described herein and other peptides and non peptide moieties known in the art may also be used to facilitate transport across the blood brain barrier.

Pharmacologic based procedures are also known in the art for circumventing the blood brain barrier including the conversion of hydrophilic compounds into lipid soluble drugs. The active agent can be encapsulated in a lipid vesicle or liposome.

The intra arterial infusion of hypertonic substances to transiently open the blood brain barrier and allow passage of hydrophilic drugs into the brain is also known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 5 686 416 to Kozarich et al. discloses the co administration of receptor mediated permeabilizer RMP peptides with compounds to be delivered to the interstitial fluid compartment of the brain to cause an increase in the permeability of the blood brain barrier and effect increased delivery of the compounds to the brain.

One method of transporting an active agent across the blood brain barrier is to couple or conjugate the active agent to a second molecule a carrier which is a peptide or non proteinaceous moiety selected for its ability to penetrate the blood brain barrier and transport the active agent across the blood brain barrier. Examples of suitable carriers include pyridinium fatty acids inositol cholesterol and glucose derivatives also add vitamin C. The carrier can be a compound which enters the brain through a specific transport system in brain endothelial cells. Chimeric peptides adapted for delivering neuropharmaceutical agents into the brain by receptor mediated transcytosis through the blood brain barrier are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 902 505 to Pardridge et al. These chimeric peptides comprise a pharmaceutical agent conjugated with a transportable peptide capable of crossing the blood brain barrier by transcytosis.

An alternative method of administering peptides of the present invention is carried out by administering to the subject a vector carrying a nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide where the vector is capable of entering brain cells so that the peptide is expressed and secreted and is thus available to microglial cells. Suitable vectors are typically viral vectors including DNA viruses RNA viruses and retroviruses. Techniques for utilizing vector deliver systems and carrying out gene therapy are known in the art. Herpesvirus vectors are a particular type of vector that can be employed in administering compounds of the present invention.

The examples which follow are set forth to illustrate the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting thereof.

Peptide analogs comprising substitutions of L amino acids with D amino acids were made to investigate the stereospecific nature of apoE 130 150 activity. Applicants compared all L amino acid to all D amino acid peptides to test whether a retro inverso analog of apoE 130 150 was active. The retro inverso analog was the reverse sequence i.e. apoE 150 130 made with only D amino acids all D apoE 150 130 . Contrary to the experience reported by Pescarolo et al. 2001 Applicants found that the retro inverso peptide was incredibly toxic at any concentration above 0.01 uM. Thus the dramatic reduction observed in BV 2 microglial cell production of nitric oxide was artifact because the cells in the assay had been killed with the application of this retro inverso peptide. In addition all D amino acid analogs of apoE 130 150 were without activity in suppressing nitric oxide NO release from lipopolysaccharide LPS treated BV2 microglial cells. The potential use of this compound would be for cases where one would want to kill off the macrophages and perhaps other cells that would be killed by retro inverso apoE 133 149 as potential for immunosupression therapy as a precursor to bone marrow transplant in cancer treatments. The activity of all L amino acid apoE 130 150 peptide to suppress both NO and TNF release from LPS treated BV2 cells and the lack of activity of all D amino acid analog of apoE 130 150 are consistent with a stereospecific binding of the all L amino acid peptides to the appropriate cellular receptor. Based on this data further pursuit of the retro inverso approach will need to be extended in future studies to immunosuprression paradigms.

Applicants then systematically replaced each amino acid in apoE 133 149 COG133 with an alanine and then measured the activity of each apoE peptide analog. The shorthand nomenclature used for these replacements is known to those of skill in the art for example L149A which means that the leucine L at position 149 of the apoE 133 149 peptide 133 LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL 149 SEQ. ID. NO. 1 has been replaced with an alanine A to give the L149A analog 133 LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLA 149 SEQ. ID. NO. 14 .

As shown in Table 1 alanine scanning substitutions revealed decreases in potency with respect to binding and or suppression of inflammatory activity when alanine was present at positions 139 143 144 146 147 and 149. Similar to the decrease found in L144A the L144M replacement revealed decreased potency when compared to apoE 133 149 receptor binding and suppression of inflammatory activity. This is an interesting finding because leucine is a hydrophobic residue with a short branched carbon side chain and methionine is also hydrophobic but with a slightly longer side chain having a sulfur atom. This opens the possibility that side chain size matters because the decreased activity was due to an increased side chain size either because of the longer side chain or the increased size of sulfur atom versus a carbon atom or both.

Decreased activity was also observed in the R142E replacement in which a basic arginine was replaced with an acidic glutamate residue suggesting that charge is important at this position. Decreased activity was also observed in the L148N replacement where a hydrophobic leucine was replaced with asparagine whose side chain displays a similar carbon backbone structure but places an oxygen and an amino group at the end of that similar carbon backbone suggesting that size and or reactivity play an important role at this position. The remainder of the replacements tested failed to show any significant change in activity compared to the apoE 130 150 parent peptide or COG133 apoE 133 149 peptide .

Based on the proposed crystal structure of the entire 299 amino acid apoE protein holo apoE the region from 130 150 forms an alpha helix that contains the region necessary for binding to the receptor for apoE protein ligands. Applicants have also published that the apoE 130 150 peptide displays an alpha helical conformation in solution as measured by circular dichroism spectra Laskowitz et al. 2001 . A typical alpha helix contains 3.6 amino acid residues per one complete turn of 360 degrees or 36 residues per 10 complete turns. Using this information together with a helical wheel representation of the peptide it appears that there is one side surface of this helical structure associated with activity of the peptide in our assays helical wheel . This information is valuable as it provides an initial map for those residues that are important for the activity of the apoE 130 150.

To arrive at the results in Table 1 multiple studies were performed on each peptide analog. For suppression of inflammation profiling each peptide analog was tested at a final concentration of 0.1 1 0.5 1 3 5 10 and 25 M in an LPS induced BV2 microglial cell release of NO and or TNF . Reduced activity at a particular residue position is shown with a superscript sign and refers to EC50 s whose concentrations were higher than the 3.5 M EC50 of COG133 defined as the concentration where a 50 reduction of NO or TNF release was observed on at least 2 different testing days . Receptor binding was obtained through a modified published procedure Misra et al. 2001 and virtually identical results were obtained with the published procedure. The modification was a biotin label on the apoE peptide biotin LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL amide SEQ. ID. NO. 1 which allows detection with I streptavidin ISA Amersham . In addition Applicants employed binding to 250 000 cells per well in 6 well dishes Nunc at 4 C. which helped to provide more consistent and larger numbers of counts of specific binding of peptide. As an example of this approach Applicants determined that unlabeled apoE 133 149 inhibited 50 of the binding of biotinylated apoE 133 149 at 4 M IC50 4 M a number that is in good agreement with the 3.5 M EC50 of apoE 133 149 for suppression of inflammation activity. In general the values for EC50 s and IC50 s for different peptide analogs were consistent between the binding assay and the biological activity assay.

In an effort to minimize the size of apoE 130 150 while preserving maximal activity the peptide was progressively truncated from the amino terminal and from the carboxy terminal ends. Starting with the carboxy terminus apoE 130 149 maintained the activity of the apoE 130 150 parent peptide. In contrast apoE 130 148 and apoE 130 147 failed to show activity at 25 M. Starting from the amino terminus apoE 133 149 maintained the activity of the apoE 130 150 parent peptide. ApoE 139 149 failed to show activity even at 25 M. Of the remaining intervening peptides apoE 134 149 was the most active but was 2.5 fold less potent than apoE 130 150. ApoE 135 149 and apoE 136 149 were 5 and 8 fold less potent than apoE 130 150 while apoE 137 149 and apoE 138 149 failed to show activity even at 25 M. From these activity measurements apoE 133 149 COG133 was the shortest apoE peptide that maintains the complete activity of the apoE 130 150 parent peptide. Applicants have based the new peptide analogs on apoE 133 149 COG133 to further refine the structure activity relationships of the residues that are critical to the pharmacological activity of the apoE peptide.

The field of peptide mimetics comprises the transformation of selected peptide compounds into small molecules with drug like pharmaceutical properties Olson et al. 1993 1995 Smith et al. 1997 1998 2000 Hirschmann et al. 1996 Liu et al. 2000 . Peptide mimetics encompasses a range of technologies from peptide analogs with unnatural amino acids in the backbone peptide surrogates replacing a peptide amide bond with an olefin or other isostere and small molecule mimetics in which the peptide is replaced in a rational way by a designed small molecule using non peptide templates. New characteristics are incorporated into mimetics that extend their utility to many potential receptor targets and vastly increase diversity by creating novel building blocks structural templates and pathways of assembly that are not possible through natural processes or via genetic engineering. These peptide mimetics incorporate unique proprietary scaffolds that couple potent biological activity with enhanced bioavailability and constitute novel patentable new chemical entities. See for example. Templates suitable for enzyme inhibition have been designed based on a pyrrolinone chemical class Provid Pharmaceuticals Piscataway N.J. . Other systems are based on carbohydrates as privileged templates for non peptide mimetics of peptides an area that has led to inhibitors of protein protein interactions and of G protein coupled receptors. Non peptide mimetics such as HIV protease inhibitors and RGD based blockers of integrin receptors are clinically and commercially successful examples of the technology. Examples include saquinavir INVIRASE Roche indinavir CRIXIVAN Merck ritonavir NORVIR Abbott nelfinavir VIRACEPT Agouron Pfizer amprenavir AGENERASE Vertex Glaxo commercially successful drugs sales exceeding 1 billion as a group that are medically responsible for transforming HIV AIDS into a treatable chronic disease.

As an example Provid s efforts in non peptide mimetic chemistry have led to the identification of lead compounds for clinical development in autoimmune disease based on the inhibition of antigen presentation by MHC class II specifically HLA DR2 molecules which are associated with the disease. Related studies on HLA DR1 and HLA DR4 inhibitors performed by the Provide senior staff when they were affiliated with Hoffmann LaRoche have also been published by these investigators Bolin et al. 2000 .

One example of the approach to convert peptides to non peptide compounds is illustrated in the design of inhibitors that block the interaction between vascular cell adhesion molecule VCAM 1 on activated endothelial cells and the integrin very late antigen 4 VLA 4 receptor found on circulating lymphocytes. In this example the starting point was a peptide antagonist that was molecularly modeled and converted using a similar strategy as proposed below to potent non peptide molecules Fotouhi et al. 2000 Chen et al. 2002 . This approach is exemplified by conversion of a cyclic peptide to a small molecule but the methodology applies to organic compounds as well as to peptides.

Helix mimetics are particular areas of application of non peptide mimetics technology Olson et al. 1993 . In cases where a helical peptide is involved in a receptor interaction the backbone amide groups of the peptide are all intramolecularly hydrogen bonded to form the structural scaffold of the helix Ernst et al. 2002 Orner et al. 2001 . In this case the side chain functional groups are the dominant pharmacophore and the helix can be viewed as a replaceable template. Applicants preliminary studies on COG133 support the proposition that the receptor s recognition of a helical structure is important for biological activity and that the helical dipole structure in receptor binding is also important for biological activity such as for example to suppress inflammatory responses.

To further elucidate the role structure activity relationship of the apoE analogs Applicants set out to synthesize new analogs of COG133 as follows a analogs incorporating helix breakers or alpha helix stabilizers to substantiate the need for alpha helical character b analogs incorporating new amino acids at sites adjacent to residues that are critical to activity to determine the relative size and composition of critical sites and c analogs in which the amino acid backbone is replaced with organic templates.

The COG133 17 mer peptide represents a prototypic active sequence that has been explored utilizing single amino acid replacement and truncation studies the structure activity data from which is summarized in Table 1 above . Analysis of the data identified key residues S139 R142 K143 L144 K146 R147 and L149 that affect biological activity. In the apoE protein this segment is part of one of the helices in a four helix bundle and the residues cluster or border on one face of the helix and would present a similar epitope if COG133 exerts its observed biological effect as a helical peptide . The 20 residue apoE 130 149 peptide and two truncated 17 mer peptides 130 146 and 133 149 have been examined by circular dichroism spectrometry and all are qualitatively consistent with a mixture of helical and random coil structure Laskowitz et al. 2001 .

To test the hypothesis that the apoE 133 149 peptide must assume a helical conformation to be biologically active Applicants tested analogs that incorporated amino acid residues that are well known to inhibit folding into a helical structure such as D proline Balaram et al. 1994 Mitchell et al 2003 . Applicants synthesized two analogs of COG133 that contain the helix breaking amino acid residue D proline p at positions L141 and R145. Neither the L141p nor the R145p analogs of COG133 showed any activity at 25 M in an assay for the suppression of inflammatory cytokine TNF release or in an assay for the suppression of free radical release nitric oxide . Thus this supports Applicants hypothesis that COG133 and active analogs of COG133 are likely to assume a helical conformation when displaying biological activity such as in suppression of inflammation assays.

The initial peptide analog design and synthesis probes both structural requirements and pharmacophore elements side chain functionality required for biological activity. Both natural and unnatural amino acid building blocks will be incorporated into the COG133 sequence using standard FMOC solid phase synthesis protocols both as single and as multiple replacements to develop a pharmacophore model for this peptide. This will lead to a greater understanding of which functional groups are required for biological activity and the nature of their spatial presentation relationship. The importance of positively charged side chains as well as their relative position and conformational mobility will be investigated. Table 3 illustrates the scope of modifications that may be synthesized with combinations selected on the basis of potential neighboring group interactions which either enhance or destabilize structural properties Karle 2001 Vijayalakshmi et al. 2000 Karle et al 1990 .

ApoE3 and apoE4 holo proteins reduce inflammatory responses. Thus the hypothesis that COG133 forms a helical conformation to exert its biological activity to reduce release of inflammatory mediators is reasonable and Lynch et al. 2003 . In general small peptides such as COG133 17 mer would be expected to have little helical content when free in solution CD spectra consistent with majority of random coil structure with some small helical content however they may be induced to fold into such structural units in the presence of a receptor. Especially in light of new preliminary data with helix breakers Table 2 above stabilizing the helical form of such a peptide would be expected to favor and enhance affinity to receptor binding by virtue of pre organization. Also the intramolecular hydrogen bonding associated with helix formation reduces exposure of the polar amide backbone and results in improved membrane permeation and stability against proteolytic digestion.

Based on these ideas Applicants propose to test the helicity of COG133 by initially incorporating both helix stabilizing and helix destabilizing amino acids see Table 4 . Residues such as D proline Balaram et al. 1994 Mitchell et al 2003 have been shown to be effective helix destabilizers. In contrast alpha disubstituted glycines such as Aib dimethyl glycine like have been shown to greatly enhance helical propensities in peptides sequences as short as seven residues Karle 2001 Vijayalakshmi et al. 2000 Karle et al 1990 . Other approaches to enhancing helicity include amino and carboxy terminal capping Doig et al. 2002 1994 1993 and formation of intramolecular side chain to side chain covalent bonds that restrict the conformation of the peptide. Such covalent linkages shown to be useful in this context are disulfides lactam bridges and carbon carbon linkages derived from olefin metathesis chemistry Grubbs et al 2001 Verdine et al 2000 .

Once a minimal length of sequence which retains the correct spatial array of required molecular functionality for biological activity is obtained the unrequired peptide character amide NH s linkages can be removed and the required functionality presented on non peptidic scaffolds or templates that intrinsically possess many of the superior properties such as stability etc. desired in pharmaceutical agents.

The structure activity relationship data may be used to guide synthesis of new generations of analogs to select appropriate mimetics and to select appropriate scaffolds templates to replace peptidic segments not required for activity. The properties of these building blocks will be selected to be consistent with the molecular features determined to be important for biovailability as recently reported by a group at GlaxoSmithKline Veber et al. 2002 .

In the case of helix mimetics non peptidic scaffolds have been reported that successfully mimic 2 4 turns of an alpha helix about 7 to 14 amino acid residues . Mimetics in this class are low molecular weight organic compounds such as the terphenyls which have been shown to compete with protein protein interactions involving helix recognition Hamilton et al. 2003 2002 2001 .

Specific side chain functionality identified from the SAR studies and or pharmacophore model can be presented on the template scaffold e.g. terphenyl framework as illustrated in to mimic the functionality provided by the desired peptide shows tricyclic scaffolds as helix mimetics . Modeling studies have identified additional molecular frameworks which can serve as scaffolds to present required functionality and flexible synthetic routes have been developed for two classes of tricyclic scaffolds the carbazoles and phenothiazines. Synthesis of a series of functionalized analogs of the terphenyls carbazoles and phenothiazines may be carried out incorporating the required functionalities as determined by the pharmacophore modeling proposed above at positions X Y and Z of the scaffolds. Compounds may then be evaluated for biological activity in cell based and animal based models For instance the activity of each analog may be tested in cell based assays of reduction of inflammation in receptor binding assays and in longitudinal behavioral measures of performance in a TBI mouse model.

For the inflammation suppression assay a published cell based model of suppression of inflammation may be used employing the BV 2 mouse microglial cell line stimulated with lipopolysaccharide LPS in the absence or presence of increasing amounts of COG133 or analogs of COG133 Laskowitz et al. 2001 . In overview BV 2 cells are plated in 96 well plates in complete media and then the media is replaced the next day with serum free media or reduced serum 1 media. Cells are stimulated by the addition of LPS or by the addition of LPS plus various concentrations of COG133 as a positive control. LPS plus various concentrations of analogs of COG133 are also added to separate wells. Various concentrations of analogs of COG133 are also added to separate wells to control for activities of the peptides alone in the absence of LPS . Each concentration of peptide standard initial concentrations are 0.1 0.5 1 3 10 and 25 M is added to at least 6 wells of cells e.g. 6 wells get 0.1 M peptide 6 wells get 0.5 M peptide etc. and data are averaged from all 6 wells. After 24 hours of incubation TNF and nitrite levels in conditioned media are measured with ELISA and Griess assay as described in Laskowitz et al. 2001 . Cell viability is also measured with an MTT assay Laskowitz et al. 2001 . The EC50 of each test peptide may be compared to the EC50 of COG133 for biological activity with the help of t tests and or ANOVA where p

Receptor binding may be tested as a modification of published procedure Misra et al. 2001 . Applicants modification is to use a biotin label on the apoE peptide by synthesizing biotin LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL amide SEQ. ID. NO. 1 which can be detected with I streptavidin ISA Amersham . In addition Applicants employ binding to 250 000 cells per well in 6 well dishes Nunc at 4 C. which helps to provide more consistent and larger numbers of counts of specific binding of peptide. I streptavidin may be replaced with a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate or with a streptavidin alkaline phosphatase conjugate using CDPStar Roche Applied Science as the detection reagent.

Candidate compounds are then be screened in our closed head injury model of traumatic brain injury by intravenous dosing at 30 minutes post injury. Novel compounds are initially tested at one half their maximum tolerated dose 0.5 MTD . The maximum tolerated dose MTD is the dose of peptide given in a tail vein injection that results in no death of mice. Death is defined as a complete lack of breathing and complete unresponsiveness to external stimuli such as tail pinch and or toe pinch for a period of 10 or more minutes. Animals are given an initial dose of 1 mg kg of peptide analog or non peptide mimetic and observed continuously for 15 minutes and then at 15 minute intervals for 2 hours and then at 1 hour intervals for 4 hours more. Animals are also observed at 24 hours post injection.

The maximum tolerated dose is the maximum dose at which no animals die at any of these observation times. As an example of this procedure the MTD is determined empirically by initially dosing groups of 3 mice at 1 mg kg. If this dose is tolerated then another group of 3 mice is dosed at 3 mg kg. If this dose is tolerated then another group of 3 mice is dosed at 9 mg kg etc. If for example 9 mg kg is not tolerated because 1 or more animal died then doses in between 3 mg kg and 9 mg kg are investigated until the MTD is found. Once the MTD is empirically determined it is confirmed in another group of 7 mice for a total of 10 mice being tested at the MTD and all of which must not die to confirm that this is the MTD. While somewhat arbitrary this has proved to be a rapid and robust method to profile toxicity of new compounds in whole animals.

Experimental models of TBI play an important role in the process of evaluating and understanding the complex physiologic behavioral and histopathologic changes associated with TBI. To further clarify this interacting network the existing preclinical models of TBI have been designed to mimic closely the clinical sequelae of human TBI. One of the most widely used experimental technique to produce TBI employs a rigid impactor to generate the mechanical energy to impact the intact skull of the animal which is usually kept restrained during the delivery of the impact. Currently the most popular method to produce this type of injury utilizes pressurized air as the source of the mechanical energy that drives a steel tip impactor into the skull and is referred to as traumatic brain injury as described below. Adapted for use in several species including the mouse Smith et al. 1995 the ability to control deformation parameters with pneumatically driven devices time velocity and depth of impact and the absence of risk for rebound injury Lighthall 1988 make the traumatic brain injury TBI model superior to devices which are driven by gravity of a free falling guided weight Feeney et al. 1981 Dail et al. 1981 .

Several different preclinical paradigms have been developed to model closed head injury. Traditionally many of these head injury models were performed in rodents in which a craniotomy was performed and a reproducible injury such as fluid percussion or controlled cortical impact was applied directly to the brain parenchyma Rinder 1969 . This type of model has the advantage of creating a reproducible and well defined area of tissue injury. However the injury produced by this model may not be clinically relevant as human closed head injury caused by rapid acceleration deceleration forces such as occurs during a motor vehicle accident produces a much more heterogenous insult often with elements of torsional forces diffuse axonal injury cortical contusion and hemorrhage subdural and epidural hematoma. To address these limitations weight drop models were developed to apply a more physiological impact against the closed skull. This produced a more clinically relevant injury that created short term neurological and longer term cognitive deficits Zohar et al. 2003 . However one shortcoming of these early models was the lack of experimental control and reproducibility caused by incomplete physiological monitoring and variability of the mechanical injury caused by the weight drop. To address these limitations and take advantage of currently available transgenic murine technology this model was adapted for the mouse by utilizing a calibrated pneumatic impact against the intact skull of ventilated mice in which relevant physiological parameters core and pericranial temperatures mean arterial pressure blood glucose blood gas etc. are monitored .

C57Bl 6J male mice The Jackson Laboratory ME 12 16 weeks of age and weighing 24 32 g are used for all experiments. Anesthesia is first induced with isoflurane in 30 O balance N. The trachea is intubated and the lungs mechanically ventilated with 1.6 isoflurane in 30 O balance N. Temperature is monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 36.5 C. with a heat lamp. The right internal jugular vein is cannulated with silicone catheter. This injury model was adapted from a previously described model of closed cranial trauma for the rat Marmarou et al. 1994 as previously described Lynch et al. 2002 . Intubated animals are then placed prone on a molded acrylic cast . Placing animals on an acrylic mold helps stabilize the animals and prevent movements during the impact procedure creating a more homogeneous insult. The scalp is incised and the skull exposed. A concave 3 mm metallic disc is secured to the skull surface with the concave surface in juxtaposition to the skull by an adhesive. During model development it was found that the placement of this disk helped to reduce the incidence of skull fracture and created a more diffuse brain injury. The disc is placed directly midline just caudal to bregma . Again this midline injury was determined to be a more clinically relevant model of diffuse axonal injury. This insult results in relatively mild bilateral hippocampal injury as measured by FluoroJade HistoChem Inc. staining as compared to a unilateral insult with comparable functional deficit. The mice are positioned in a stereotactic frame. Although the stereotactactic frame helps to stabilize the animal and exactly calibrate the vertical displacement on impact 3 mm ear bars are not used due to a much higher rate of skull fracture or brainstem injury if the head rotates around the axis of the ear bars during impact . The piston is discharged at 6.8 0.2 m s so as to impact the skull in the acrylic mold to move a maximum of approximately 3 mm . Inspired isoflurane is decreased to 0.7 immediately after impact. The scalp was infiltrated with lidocaine and closed with suture. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes for protection. The incidence of skull fracture is low approximately 10 as the metal disk helps to diffuse the impact and the absence of ear bar fixation allows for displacement of the entire head. Mice were excluded if a depressed skull fracture was observed incidence of approximately 10 . The animals are allowed to recover spontaneous ventilation then extubated. The use of a surrogate physiologic control group is necessary in the experiments involving long term outcomes. Placement of an arterial catheter is necessary for measuring physiological parameters other placement can damage the femoral nerve plexus and creates a motor deficit. Other placement makes behavioral testing involving motor skills including swimming in the Morris water maze uninterpretable. In these mice arterial blood pressure blood gas and glucose measurement at baseline immediately after injury and 15 minutes after injury are monitored during the recovery period.

This midline closed head injury results in reproducible pathology in CA3 region of hippocampus visualized by FluoroJade staining. However unlike unilateral fluid percussion models this paradigm results in a more diffuse injury and there is proportionately less hippocampal neuronal injury relative to behavioral deficit. Applicants have also demonstrated that this midline injury results in radiographic cerebral edema and upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. This supports the contention that this is a clinically relevant model of diffuse axonal injury.

This paradigm was designed as a survival model of mild moderate closed head injury. Mice will initially have motor and cerebellar deficits assessed by Rotorod and neurological severity score on days 1 5 post injury as described below. To model the more subtle long term neurological deficits common in survivors of head injury memory is assessed with the Morris Water maze on days 21 25 post injury. Specifically this tests the animal s ability to find a 7.5 cm diameter hidden platform in a 105 cm diameter pool within a 90 second interval.

Traumatic brain injury TBI intravenous administration of peptides and behavioral performance will be performed as described above and as published Lynch et al. 2002 and Lynch et al. submitted . Briefly baseline performance on rotorod is established before the mice are intubated the skin over the scalp reflected and a controlled cortical impact from a pneumatic impactor given on the midline. The skin is closed with surgical clips and the animals are constantly monitored until awake from anesthesia and then hourly for the next 4 hours. At 30 minutes post impaction saline vehicle or test article COG133 analogs of COG133 or non peptide analogs of COG133 are administered via tail vein injection. Performance on rotorod is tested at 24 hours post impaction and then every day for 5 days and data is presented as described. Groups of 12 mice are used for each compound at 0.5 MTD. The negative control group receives only saline vehicle and the positive control group receives 4 mg kg of COG133 in 100 ul volume of saline by tail vein injection. Novel peptides and non peptide analogs are also given by tail vein injection.

As a control for activity of the peptide alone sham animals may be prepared and dosed with test article as detailed above except that no cortical impact will be given. Behavioral performance on rotorod will be measured as described above and compared to the performance of sham animals given COG133 at 4 mg kg via tail vein injection total of 12 groups 12 animals per group 144 animals . The Prism and or Instat computer programs will be used to assist in the determination of significance between COG133 and novel compounds by repeated measures ANOVA.

Daily Rotarod RR testing was used to assess short term motor and cerebellar deficit following head injury Hamm et al. 1994 . Mice were held by their tails and placed on the RR facing the wall by using gentle swinging motion while running in a constant speed mode. Once all mice are in place the RR is switched to accelerating mode and the latency time to either falling from the rod or turning twice 720 degrees was recorded. The mean latency time for the three trials was reported for each day.

Analogs may be further tested in our mouse TBI model at 60 90 and 180 minutes following the traumatic brain injury. In this more stringent delay test the efficacy of novel compounds may be compared to COG133 administered by tail vein injections at 60 minutes after a standard closed head injury that gives a reproducible traumatic brain injury TBI as described above. If a compound proves to be significantly better than COG133 at a 60 minute post TBI delay as determined by rotorod performance that is analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA then it is tested at a 90 minute post TBI delay. If a compound proves to be significantly better than COG133 at a 90 minute post TBI delay as determined by rotorod performance that is analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA then it is tested at a 180 minute post TBI delay.

Cognitive and learning abnormalities are common long term sequelae of TBI in the clinical population. To maximize the sensitivity and clinical relevance of our model learning retention and behavioral deficits in neurological function may be assessed. For this purpose changes in performance in the Morris Water Maze task may be studied Morris 1984 . This task takes advantage of rodents being natural swimmers and measures the ability of the animal to incorporate visuospatial cues into working and reference memory. Performance on this task may be a correlate of the neuropsychiatric deficit seen in a human clinical population. In theory the mice could escape from the task by swimming randomly or in non systematic paths throughout the pool however if working memory is intact they will use distal cues from fixed objects in the testing chamber to learn the relative position of the platform. Thus the time latency to find the platform should decrease as a function of practice and may be used as an index of learning ability.

Some peptides could be cleaved by trypsin like proteases. The cleavage of peptides may be measured using trypsin and brain homogenates in a Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry LC MS method. Briefly trypsin linked to beaded agarose Pierce is washed twice with 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0 followed by two washes with calcium magnesium free phosphate buffered saline pH 8.0 PBS 8 . Resin is resuspended in PBS 8 containing 20 ug ml of peptide substrate and digested at 37 C for 0 0.1 1 5 and 20 hours. Triplicate samples are evaluated at each time point. Samples are briefly centrifuged resin free supernatants were extracted with ATI acetonitrile TFA internal standard processed and submitted for LC MS quantitation under the following conditions 

Similarly whole mouse brain homogenates can be used as a source of intracellular and extracellular proteases that may degrade peptides. In this case fresh mouse brains may be homogenized at 100 mg wet weight per ml PBS pH 7.4 . Peptide substrates at 40 ug ml in PBS pH 7.4 are mixed with an equal volume of brain homogenate and incubated at 37 C for 0 0.1 1 5 and 20 hours before extraction with ATI processing and submission for quantitation of degradation products against our internal standard peptide by LC MS as described above. Triplicate samples are evaluated at each time point. In each experiment the moles of intact non degraded peptide and the moles of major metabolites fragments that are at least 20 of the molar amount of intact non degraded peptide are measured at each time point. Homogenized brains may also be used to measure peptide uptake into the brain using the LC MS procedure.

Plasma half life of peptides may also be measured using the LC MS procedure by exposing each peptide derivative to mouse blood plasma and measuring recovery over time as compared to a standard control.

We synthesized COG1410 an analog containing two aminoisobutyric acid Aib substitutions at positions L140 and R145. Aib is a non natural amino acid which has been shown to form helical conformations regardless of the amino acid types present in the peptide Marshall et al. 1990 . In addition Aib improves binding affinity because it exhibits a reduction in conformational entropy loss upon binding relative to other amino acids Ratnaparkhi et al. 2000 .

As depicted in COG1410 was significantly more potent than COG133 in our cell based assay of suppression of nitric oxide 9A and TNFa 9B release. In addition preliminary screening in vivo indicated that COG1410 was neuroprotective when administered at 120 minutes following TBI unlike COG133 which was devoid of neuroprotective activity at this time point .

Preliminary dose response studies indicated that the minimum effective dose MED the lowest dose which exhibits a statistically significant improvement in performance compared to vehicle treated controls of COG1410 was about the same as that of COG133 0.3 mg Kg vs. 0.4 mg Kg respectively. However the maximum tolerated dose MTD the highest dose that results the death of no mice in 24 hours of COG1410 was 8 mg Kg versus an MTD of 1.4 mg Kg for COG133. The Therapeutic Index TI the ratio of the MTD to the MED of COG1410 is 26 and is significantly better than the TI of 3.5 for COG133. The higher the TI the more safe the drug is considered to be. This high TI of COG1410 indicates that it would take a much higher dose to invoke a toxic response than it does to cause a beneficial and desired protective effect.

Of the many pharmacokinetic parameters to consider plasma half life and resistance to proteolytic degradation are two characteristics of peptides that can be precisely measured with Liquid Chromatography Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry LC MS methodology. With the help of LCMS LLC we have developed an LC MS method to measure peptide amounts and peptide fragments in blood plasma and in mouse brain extracts.

Briefly a calibration curve was constructed by adding 0 0.005 0.025 0.1 1.0 5 10 or 25 ug ml of COG133 to mouse blood plasma. These same concentrations of COG133 were also added to PBS phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 . Plasma or PBS containing COG133 was extracted by addition of 1 volume of PBS and 1 volume of ATI ATI 0.6 trifluoroacetic acid and 3 ug ml of an internal standard peptide LAVLLASHLRKLRKRLL SEQ. ID. NO. 58 in acetonitrile vortexing centrifuging at 15 000 g for 10 minutes and collecting the top organic phase layer as extracted samples. Extracted samples were submitted for LC MS quantitation under the conditions described above Example 1 and gave a linear concentration signal curve data not shown R 0.9984 indicating that increases in signal were linearly proportional to increased amounts of COG133 in a sample.

Compared to our internal standard peptide LAVLLASHLRKLRKRLL SEQ. ID. NO. 58 we consistently recovered 80 of COG133 in each plasma sample to give the Analytical Results shown in the following table.

For our half life experiment COG133 0.4 mg Kg was injected into the tail vein of male C57B1 6 mice 1 ml of blood collected by cardiac puncture at the indicated times and blood plasma processed as described above. The plasma concentration time graph gives COG133 an 8 minute half life in mouse blood plasma . Using this same procedure with internal standards we calculate a 2 minute half life for intact non degraded COG1410 in mouse blood plasma data not shown .

We have employed a similar LC MS procedure to measure the amount of intact non degraded COG1410 in brain. Briefly we administered 4 mg Kg of COG1410 via tail vein injection at time 0 perfused mice at 5 minutes post injection with isotonic saline via cardiac puncture to remove blood from the cerebrovasculature and removed the perfused brains at 10 minutes post injection. Brains were homogenized in 1 ml of PBS containing a protease inhibitor cocktail Roche Diagnostics 10 mg ml per 0.1 g wet weight of brain material. Homogenates were mixed with an equal volume of ATI vortexed centrifuged and samples submitted for LC MS as described above. Using this method we find a peak at 4.90 minutes in the 3d COG1410 and in the 2d COG1410 brains with the proper m z ratio of 705 for the M 2H 2 ion of COG1410. This preliminary experiment indicates that a measurable amount of COG1410 enters the brain within the 5 minute entry phase and stays in the brain during the next 5 minute perfusion phase of this experiment. This is consistent with our pharmacological data showing significant COG1410 mediated improvements in behavioral tests of performance after TBI data not shown .

We have employed a similar LC MS procedure to identify fragments of COG1410 that may arise by degradation processes. Briefly using plasma from mice receiving COG1410 several smaller peptide fragments were identified with this LC MS method that are not found in plasma from untreated mice data not shown . Using the MS MS option on the mass spectrometer to obtain partial sequence of these fragments it appears that at least one of the major metabolites is likely to be acetyl AS Aib LRKL Aib KR SEQ. ID. NO. 59 a fragment which could result from digestion of intact COG1410 by trypsin like proteases or carboxypeptidase activities. The presence of this fragment suggests that the one explanation for the shorter half life of COG1410 could be its susceptibility to trypsin like proteases and or carboxypeptidase activities.

These data with COG1410 indicate the feasibility of developing compounds with increased stability enhanced potency and BBB permeability decreased toxicity increased therapeutic index and expanded therapeutic window for the treatment of TBI. Additional analogs with even better pharmaceutical properties such as increased resistance to degradation are achievable by synthesis of limited numbers of derivatives using the guidelines provided above.

COG1410 is a significant improvement over COG133 by a number of criteria. Our preliminary data showed that alpha helical structure is very important and enhancement of this helical structure resulted in COG1410. Our initial strategy to include amino acids like Aib that encourage helix conformations will be extended to two new positions which are potentially allowable from the alanine scanning work see Example 1 . Further enhancements to the helical nature of COG1410 may be achieved by derivatization of the side chains of the amino acids on the face of the helix that does not appear to directly confer bioactivity of the peptide. The overall nature of these derivatives would be to include an olefin bridge between selected amino acids that would constrain its flexibility and increase the propensity to remain in a helical structure.

Our preliminary data also showed that proteolysis of COG1410 may contribute to its lack of stability. In addition our alanine scanning data showed the carboxy terminal leucine was critical for activity suggesting that proteolytic removal of this residue would result in lack of bio activity. More precise definition of proteolytic fragments followed by substitution of selected amino acids and or derivatization of selected amino acids should increase resistance to proteolysis while maintaining bio activity.

Thus COG1410 may be further derivatized to increase helicity in 3 ways 1 enhance helicity by incorporation of Aib residues at selected positions 2 enhance helicity by amino terminal capping Doig et al. 2002 1994 1993 and 3 enhance helicity by forming intramolecular side chain to side chain covalent bonds that restrict the conformation of the peptide. Covalent linkages that have shown to be useful in this context derive from olefin metathesis chemistry and would span the i to i 4 or i to i 7 positions with alkene containing bridges Grubbs et al 2001 Schafmeister et al 2000 .

Using a ring closing metathesis RCM strategy olefin sidechains may be incorporated to covalently link side chain to side chain on selected residues in the sequence ASHLRKLRKRLL SEQ. ID. NO. 44 . COG 1410 appears to form an amphipathic alpha helix with all of the charged residues on one face of the helix and all of the hydrophobic residues on the opposite face of the helix. Since alanine substitutions of most charged residues significantly reduced anti inflammatory activity Table 1 charged residues are not candidates for side chain linking procedures with the exception of R145 where Aib substitution enhanced bioactivity . This leaves most of the hydrophobic residues available for modification by side chain linking procedures. Thus the following cross linked molecules may be synthesized where amino acids denoted as X and Z can be any amino acid which contains a side chain that will be linked to the cross linking olefin bridge ASHXRKLZKRLL SEQ. ID. NO. 60 XSHLRKLZKRLL SEQ. ID. NO. 61 ASXLRKLRKZLL SEQ. ID. NO. 62 and ASHXRKLRKRZL SEQ. ID. NO. 63 .

Briefly X and Z are alpha methyl alpha alkenyl di substituted amino acids both butenyl for i i 4 crosslinks one butenyl and one pentenyl for i i 7 crosslinks incorporated into the peptide chain during conventional solid phase synthesis. While still on the solid support and in the capped state the peptide is reacted with the Grubbs catalyst Bis tricyclohexylphosphine benzylidine ruthenium IV dichloride in 1 2 dichloroethane. Catalyst is removed by washing the resin and metathesized peptide is cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid purified on a C18 reverse phase HPLC column and confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. In addition to the potential for enhancing the helical structure the presence of the bridge may also increase resistance to proteolysis by the olefin side chain physically blocking binding of the peptide to proteases Verdine et al. 2000 .

Our preliminary data with LC MS has identified acetyl AS Aib LRKL Aib KR SEQ. ID. NO. 59 as a potentially important metabolite of COG1410. This fragment could be generated by endoproteolytic cleavage by trypsin like proteases and or exoproteolytic cleavage by carboxypeptidases. To address the endoprotease possibility derivatives of COG1410 may be synthesized which substitute ornithine nitroarginine homoarginine or dimethyl arginine for arginine at position 147 via standard Fmoc chemistry on an automated peptide synthesizer. To address the exoprotease possibility derivatives of COG1410 may be synthesized which substitute valine methionine or isoleucine for leucine at position 149.

As one of the reliable animal models of multiple sclerosis MS experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE is an inflammatory disease causing severe demyelination in the central nervous system CNS Pender Wolfe 2002 . EAE and MS share common histological features including microglia activation and prominent infiltration into the CNS of inflammatory cells that consist mainly of T lymphocytes and macrophages Heber Katz 1993 Hemmer Archelos et al. 2002 . These activated effector cells release a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF IL 1 IFN and lymphotoxins. These factors in turn encourage further accumulation of infiltrating cells which are associated with inflammation and tissue damage Eng Ghirnikar et al. 1996 Benveniste 1997 Wiemann Van et al. 1998 .

On screening the chromosomal localization of the multiple sclerosis genes a MS gene is linked to markers located in the 19q13.3 region where apolipoprotein E ApoE gene locates Lucotte 2002 . This finding together with the reports that patients having APOE 4 are more likely to be affected with severe MS Chapman Vinokurov et al. 2001 Fazekas Strasser Fuchs et al. 2001 Schmidt Barcellos et al. 2002 Materman Zhang et al. 2002 suggests that APOE may participate in the development of multiple sclerosis Weatherby Mann e al. 2000 Weatherby Mann et al. 2000 .

Female C57BL 6J mice 12 weeks old were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed in the Duke University Experimental Animal Facility. Animal care and experimental procedures conformed to the regulations approved by the Duke University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG peptide is derived from residues 35 55 of the mouse MOG protein MOG 35 55 MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK SEQ. ID. NO. 64 and apoE mimetic peptide COG133 is derived from residues 133 to 149 of human apolipoprotein E with the sequence of acetyl LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL amide SEQ. ID. NO. 11. ApoE reverse peptide designated as COG 149 is treated as scrambled control of COG133 here. Antennapedia linked peptide designated as COG134 aka COG4502 combines antennapedia prefix peptide with COG133. All the peptides were synthesized by the Peptide Synthesis Facility at UNC using FMOC reagents with Merrifield solid phase chemistry and purified through RP HPLC. The following reagents were purchased from Sigma pertussis toxin LPS and IFN . Quantitative ELISA kits for TNF and IL 6 were obtained from Biosource.

EAE was induced in mice following the method of Feinstein et al. Feinstein Galea et al. 2002 1 two s.c. injections one on each flank of the hind legs with 300 g MOG35 55 peptide in 0.1 ml PBS emulsified in an equal volume of CFA containing 5 mg ml of H37RA Difco St. Louis Mo. were given on Day 0.2 Pertussis toxin 200 ng per mouse in 0.1 ml PBS was given i.p. immediately and 48 h after first MOG injection. 3 a booster immunization with an identical emulsion route of administration and location was given on Day 7.

After the first MOG injection. Day 0 mice were randomly separated into three groups of 15 mice per group to serve as control group apoE 133 149 COG133 SEQ. ID. NO. 1 treated group and apoE reverse peptide treated group. COG133 in saline reverse peptide in saline or normal saline was intravenously injected at a dose of 1 mg kg in 100 .mu.l volume on Day 6 7 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 and 22 to give a total of 10 doses for each treatment group.

Following the encephalitogenic challenge mice were monitored daily and neurological impairment was evaluated by clinical score C.S. as follows 0 no clinical signs of EAE 1 limp tail 2 flaccid tail and abnormal gait ataxia and or paresis of hind limbs 3 severe hind limb paresis 4 complete paralysis with hind body and 5 moribund or death.

For this purpose three mice with clinical scores of 0 and three with clinical scores of 4 at 30 dpi day post immunization were used for preparation of peritoneal macrophage cultures. Macrophages were collected after peritoneal lavage with 3 ml heparin 10 U ml containing PBS and then seeded to 96 well microplates at a density of 1 10cells well in Dulbecco s MEM containing 10 fetal bovine serum 2 mM L glutamine serum 1 HEPES and 100 U ml penicillin and 100 g ml streptomycin 37 C. in a humidified incubator with 5 CO. 24 h later the serum containing medium was removed and cells were washed once with serum free medium. To examine the differentiated response of macrophage to immune stimulators macrophages obtained from mice with clinical scores of 0 or 4 were exposed to serial concentrations of IFN LPS or MOG35 55 peptide. To investigate the effect of COG133 or COG134 peptide on IFN LPS or MOG induced cytokine production designated concentrations of these peptides were applied 30 min prior to IFN LPS or MOG treatment. Media were collected at 45 h or 72 h and analyzed by ELISA for TNF and IL 6 or for nitric oxide NO as detailed below.

As the stable end product of nitric oxide release nitrite levels in conditioned media were determined by injecting 50 l media sample into a Sievers 280 NOA analyzer Boulder Colo. USA . Total protein g well was measured using the BCA method Pierce Rockford Ill. USA according to manufacturer s instructions with BSA as standard. BCA values were measured using a Molecular Devices Thermomax Microplate Reader Menlo Park Calif. USA at OD562. Nitric oxide levels ere expressed as M NO mg protein.

For cytokine assays supernatants were collected 45 h after tNF LPS or MOG treatments and quantitative ELISAs using selected pairs of monoclonal antibodies as recommended by the manufacturer Biosource were performed to quantify the cytokines TNF and IL 6. For TNF ELISA 96 well ELISA plates were pre coated with rabbit anti mouse polyclonal to TNF as capture antibodies for 18 h at 2 8 C. and then blocked for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were incubated with samples or mouse TNF standards. Following incubation for 2 h at room temperature the wells were washed after which hamster anti mouse TNF biotinylated secondary antibody and horseradish peroxidase conjugate were added. Tetramethylbenzidine TMB solution was then added and peroxidase catalyzed color change was stopped by acidification with 2 NHSO. The plates were scanned at wavelength 450 nm and the absorbance were measured. The results are expressed as the mean concentration pg ml SEM.

For IL 6 ELISA rat anti mouse monoclonal to IL 6 was used as capture antibody and biotinylated rat anti mouse monoclonal to IL 6 as detection antibody. The rest of procedure is identical to that of TNF ELISA.

Mice were anesthetized bled and perfused with 25 ml PBS and 25 ml 4 paraformaldehyde in buffered PBS. Brains and spinal cords were dissected out from 3 mice with a clinical score of 0 and another 3 mice with a clinical score of 4 on day 30 post immunization. Tissues were post fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde for another 24 h and then stored in 1 PBS with 0.1 sodium azide. Fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and 5 m thick sections were cut from brain the brain stem and three different levels of spinal cord cervical thoracic and lumbar . Sections were stained with hematoxylin eosin for evidence of inflammation and Luxol fast blue for demyelination . The severity of inflammation was evaluated using the following criteria 0 no inflammation 1 cellular infiltrates only in the perivascular areas and meninges 2 mild cellular infiltrates only in parenchyma 1 10 section 3 moderate cellular infiltrates in parenchyma 11 100 section 4 marked cellular infiltrates in parenchyma 100 section .

Rotarod data cytokines and nitrite concentrations were analyzed by ANOVA followed by Dunnet s comparison. Disease scores were analyzed by Mann Whitney test.

To examine the putative protective effect of COG133 intravenous administration of ten doses of 1 mg kg COG133 or reverse peptide or normal saline were given by tail vein injection beginning on Day 6 and ending on Day 22. Clinical signs were examined daily and behaviors on RotaRod by every other day. The mean maximum clinical scores of COG133 treated group were significantly lower than that of saline or scramble peptide treated group P

Using death which generates a clinical score of 5 as an endpoint 4 mice died of disease in saline treated group of 15 whereas no animals died in the COG133 treated group of 15 and the treated group s highest clinical score was 3 see Table 6 . The mean time to disease onset of the COG133 treated group seemed to be a little delayed in comparison with control groups although there was no statistically significant difference. Furthermore COG133 treatment robustly facilitated the recovery from the disease by the data showing that the mean clinical score of COG133 group was much lower than control groups at Day 30.

Performance on RotaRod of each mouse was tested at a every two day regimen. Values were expressed as a percentage versus that of d0. RotaRod data didn t show significance at the developing phase of disease whereas the value of COG133 treated group was much higher than that of control groups at the recovery phage P

MOG or LPS IFN treatments induce macrophage production of NO TNF and IL 6 in a clinical score dependent manner

To examine the roles of cytokines such as TNF and IL 6 and the free radical nitric oxide or NO in the pathogenesis of EAE macrophages were collected from mice with different clinical severity C.S. 0 and 4 and then challenged with various immune stimulators i.e. LPS and IFN or MOG peptide. Although MOG peptide is a relatively mild immune stimulator compared with LPS IFN a robust production of NO was still observed in macrophages from EAE mice in a concentration dependent fashion . High concentrations of MOG 20 g ml equivalent to 7.75 M treated macrophages from severely impaired mice with a C.S. of 4 mice elicited much higher release of nitric oxide than from MOG treated macrophages from non impaired mice with a C.S. of 0 suggesting that production of NO may significantly contribute to the development of deleterious disease.

MOG treatment induced TNF secretion which showed a pattern that differs from the NO release pattern. The baseline of TNF at C.S. 0 is much higher than that of C.S. 4 suggesting a role for TNF in initiating of the disease. In addition MOG induced IL 6 secretion was undetectable in the present study.

In macrophages from C.S. 4 mice LPS IFN stimulated significantly higher production of NO TNF and IL 6 than in LPS IFN stimulated macrophages from C.S. 0 mice D E .

To explore the mechanism of beneficial effect of COG133 on the development of EAE levels of NO and TNF in the media of macrophages from C.S. 4 mice were measured 72 h after exposure to MOG 20 g ml 7.75 M . COG133 inhibited production of NO and TNF in a concentration dependent manner and B respectively whereas reverse peptide did not display such an inhibitory effect.

Robust production of NO TNF and IL 6 was induced by LPS and IFN treatments of macrophages . At lower concentration 1 M rather than at higher concentration 5 M COG133 significantly inhibited production of NO A TNF B and IL 6 C P

COG134 Antennapedia COG133 Chimera aka COG4502 Potently Suppressed the Production of Cytokines Induced by MOG or by LPS IFN Treatments.

Compared with COG133 the chimeric peptide composed of antennapedia followed by apoE 133 149 aka COG134 or COG4502 is significantly more powerful in inhibiting cytokine production induced by either MOG or by LPS IFN treatments . COG134 COG4502 at 5 M inhibited the production of NO TNF and IL 6 completely showing that the levels of all cytokines were turned back to basal level. COG134 also displays a dose dependent ability to inhibit cytokine and free radical release. As a control for COG134 the portion of antennapedia that serves as a prefix to COG133 was synthesized and also tested in this system. This antennapedia prefix peptide showed no activity in our system.

We have previously shown that COG133 retains the bioactivity of the intact apoE holoprotein in its ability to suppress microglia the brain s macrophage activation Laskowitz et al. 2001 and initiate an intracellular signaling cascade in cultured cells Misra et al. 2001 . To investigate the mechanism by which apoE exerts its immunomodulatory effects we examined the ability of COG133 to suppress systemic inflammatory responses in vivo in C57BL6 mice. The inflammatory response to LPS was monitored by measuring the temporal secretion and expression profiles of two well described pro inflammatory cytokines Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha TNFa and interleukin 6 IL 6 in the peripheral circulation and in the brain. Mice were injected with LPS via the tail vein and serum samples were obtained at indicated times and levels of TNFa and IL 6 were measured with ELISA. When co administered with LPS COG133 significantly reduced serum TNFa levels at one hour and reduced serum IL 6 levels at one and three hours . There was no measurable TNFa or IL 6 protein at 24 hours post injection in either group. These results indicate that COG133 can suppress LPS induced inflammation in a whole animal model and appears to be particularly effective at suppressing TNFa and IL6 release Lynch et al. 2003 .

In addition to suppression of cytokine release in the periphery we also examined the ability of COG133 to suppress CNS inflammatory responses induced following tail vein administration of LPS. To prevent the contamination of brain samples with blood and other cells mice in these studies were perfused with saline i.e. the blood is flushed out of the microvasculature and thus only cytokines inside the brain compartment are present in the sample. Animals treated with COG133 exhibited TNFa levels in the brain that were significantly reduced at 1 and 3 hours post injection of LPS compared to animals receiving vehicle p

In this study we demonstrate that COG133 an apoE mimetic peptide shows significant ability to ameliorate the behavioral consequences of an experimentally induced allergic encephalomyelitis EAE which mimics most of the features of multiple sclerosis in humans. MS is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by widespread inflammation focal demyelination and a variable degree of axonal loss Kornek Storch et al. 2000 . Massive infiltration of macrophages and T lymphocytes could be observed as a significant sign of inflammation throughout the whole brain especially in spinal cord Raine 1994 . Release of Pro inflammatory cytokines by infiltrated and activated macrophage and T lymphocytes are key mediators of CNS pathology in EAE. Indeed large amounts of TNF IFN and IL 1 are present in demyelinating plaques Brosnan Cannella et al. 1995 . In addition infiltrated immune reactive cells directly or indirectly by releasing toxic cytokines activate astroglia and microglia which are thought of as macrophage in CNS and therefore lead to a secondary cascade of inflammatory response Prineas Kwon et al. 2001 . Inflammation in spinal cord then becomes prominent during exacerbations and leads to significant impairment of movement and in some case death of the mouse subject. Hence anti inflammatory intervention has extracted considerable interest as a promising strategy to prevent the deleterious process of the disease Rieckmann Maurer 2002 .

The beneficial effects of apoE mimetic peptides as seen in this study include delaying the onset of symptoms of EAE attenuating the severity of disease and facilitating recovery. Using a standard protocol of immunization with MOG peptide or treatment with LPS IFN gamma a robust debilitating disease was observed. Animals treated with this immunization protocol and with subsequent tail vein injections of saline vehicle or with the reverse peptide i.e. apoE 149 133 display significantly worse signs of clinical disease than those animals injected with COG133. Thus the present study indicates a possible utility for COG133 in the therapeutic intervention of MS and suggests that improved peptide derivatives such as COG 432 and COG1410 which exhibit a wider therapeutic window and a higher therapeutic index will also be useful for therapeutic intervention. Interestingly previous works of our laboratory showed that COG133 exerted an anti inflammatory effect Lynch Tang et al. 2003 . COG133 significantly inhibited LPS induced production of NO and TNF in both primary glial cultures and BV2 cell a murine microglial cell line Laskowitz Thekdi et al. 2001 . Now the present study that COG133 significantly improves the symptom of EAE provides novel evidence to support the notion that apoE peptide exerts anti inflammatory effect in vivo.

Separate in vivo studies of apoE deficiency in the autoimmunity models EAE and EAN have indicated that apoE protects mice from greater disease severity and death by inhibiting 1 the magnitude of the inflammatory response and 2 the amount of tissue destruction that is sustained in a chronic Th1 mediated autoimmune response. Thus ApoE mimetic peptides may be tested for efficacy in a collagen induced model of rheumatoid arthritis.

The protocol written by Moore 2003 will be followed to produce collagen induced arthritis in DBA 1 mice. This protocol is analogous the procedure Chondrex Inc recommends for generating CIA in mice using type II collagen. A disease incidence of 80 100 is routinely achieved using this method. We will begin treating mice on the first day that disease appears and for a further 14 days putting mice at approximately 40 days post sensitization.

Mice will be sensitized to type II collagen by the following protocol. A solution of 0.01 M acetic acid will be added to chicken type II collagen to create a concentration of 4 mg ml Chondrex Inc. Redmond Wash. . Collagen will be dissolved overnight and the suspension will be mixed on a roller mixer at 4 C. Dissolved collagen will be emulsified by adding an equal volume of ice cold Freund s complete adjuvant. Freund s complete adjuvant will consist of Freund s incomplete adjuvant combined with heat killed strain H37Ra at a final concentration of 4 mg ml Difco Laboratories Detroit Mich. . Each mouse will receive a 100 ul intradermal injection at the base of the tail. A 100 ul booster injection that contains 1 mg ml bovine type II collagen in 0.01 acetic acid will be given i.p. on day 21 post sensitization. Using this protocol symptoms routinely develop starting about 25 days after sensitization. However mice will not begin the 14 day treatment until the first day symptoms of arthritis appear. The mean time after sensitization that we expect animals to be sacrificed is Day 40. The sham arthritis group will not receive injections of antigen when other groups are sensitized and boosted. A total of 270 male DBA mice Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbour Me. ranging from 10 12 weeks in age will be used in 3 separate experiments as well as two preliminary experiments to validate the disease model.

Mice will be randomly assigned to treatment groups. Each group will contain 15 mice. A negative control consisting of vehicle alone PBS a reverse peptide control 2.7 mg kg a positive control consisting of dexamethasone 1.0 mg kg and three doses of COG133 or other ApoE peptide diluted in sterile saline will be tested 0.3 0.9 and 2.7 mg kg. Dosages are based on data obtained in vitro and in vivo experiments presented in the preliminary results section. ApoE peptide vehicle or dexamethasone will be given by intraperitoneal injection each day according to the following schedule Day 0 sensitization Day 21 booster about Days 21 25 treatment for 14 days of active disease about Day 40 sacrifice after 14 days of disease. Mice will be analyzed daily for disease severity and paw swelling throughout the experiment until mice are sacrificed. On day 14 of disease mice will be sacrificed by asphyxiation with CO weighed assessed for inflammation and disease severity. Each patella will be dissected out dried and weighed.

The effect of COG133 therapy on inflammation and bone loss in healthy mice will also be assessed. A group of sham mice will not be sensitized and boosted at the time other mice are given collagen induced arthritis. These mice will receive the high dose COG133 therapy 2.7 mg kg or COG1410 0.6 mg Kg for 14 days. Prior to initiation of the study we will validate the CIA model in a group of untreated mice by histological and biochemical means. Ten DBA 1 male mice will be sensitized and boosted as outlined above but not treated rather parameters of inflammation will be monitored by means of paw volume and after 14 days of disease mice will be sacrificed weighed and blood will be collected to test for anti type II collagen IgG. Five mice will have bone joints removed for histological analysis to confirm the presence and uniformity of CIA the other five mice will have each patella removed dried and weighed to confirm measurable and reproducible bone loss. A further five healthy age matched controls will be sacrificed to obtain baseline values for histology and patellar bone mass. This experiment will be repeated a second time to confirm that our disease severity is consistent and reproducible. At the time of sacrifice peripheral blood will be collected plasma will be separated and then assayed in an ELISA for the amount of anti collagen antibody present. A commercial assay kit arthrogen CIA Mouse IgG Anti Type II Collagen ELISA kit will be used to confirm the uniformity of the collagen type II sensitization and boost Chondrex .

Validation of CIA by means of histology Ankle and wrist joints will be excised and fixed in 10 buffered formalin and then decalcified for three days in a solution of 10 formic acid Kawabuta et al. 2003 . Tissues will be sent to the Department of Pathology at Duke University Medical Center or an acceptable commercial vendor to be embedded in paraffin cut into 6 um sections and mounted on glass slides. Slides will be stained by three different means to enable the following markers of disease to be evaluated changes in the amount of collagen present in the bone joint masson s trichrome reductions in cartilage safranin 0 and formation of pannus tissue narrowing of joint spaces as well as inflammatory cell infiltrate hematoxylin and eosin . Tissue sections will be evaluated using a semi quantitative means van Meurs et al. 1999 Beehler et al. 2003 Kawabata et al. 2004 .

Quantification of the inflammatory response by paw volume The disease severity clinical score will be assessed as outlined by Moore 2003 . Each digit that shows signs of involvement is scored as 1 any inflammation in the hind or fore limbs is scored as 1 limb swelling in the foot pad ankle or wrist each adds a score of 1 to the clinical score. The total number of inflamed limbs mouse will also be noted. A digital plethysmometer paw volume meter Stoelting Co. Wood Dale Ill. will be used to measure changes in paw swelling over time and expressed as the mean standard error of the mean SEM experimental group. To ensure consistency in measuring paw volume changes mice will be tattooed 2 weeks before the experiments begin with a line at the elbow and the knee joints prior to sensitization so that a consistent amount of the paw of each mouse is measured. Total paw swelling will be determined by calculating the area under the curve for each animal during the study. Data from each experimental group will be expressed as the mean total paw swelling S.E.M.

Quantification of bone loss At the time mice are sacrificed each patella will be dissected out. Each patella will be dried overnight at 70 C. and weighed again. Patella weights are expressed as a percentage compared to healthy mice of similar age and weight. Likewise the dry weight of patellas will be expressed as mean S.E.M. for the experimental group.

Statistics Differences between experimental groups will be determined by an analysis of variance ANOVA while differences between pairs of groups will be determined by the Mann Whitney U test. A p value of 

We expect that COG133 COG1410 and other ApoE mimetic peptides at the doses and length of treatment proposed above will be well tolerated in normal mice. Preliminary data using COG133 in mice with EAE has shown the peptide was well tolerated. Furthermore it is expected that this treatment will elicit a dose dependent inhibition in the severity of CIA as well as measures of inflammation and bone loss after 14 days of disease. We do not expect COG133 to act exclusively on the inflammatory process or bone loss but attenuate both arms of the disease process equally.

Pannus tissue is comprised of synovial cells that have undergone hyperproliferation within the bone joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and mice with CIA. This tissue is a major contributor to the destruction of cartilage and bone because of it s production of cytokines MMPs and nitric oxide Pillinger et al. 2000 . Testing a candidate therapy for RA using cells that are physiologically relevant to the disease process will aid in determining the potential benefit the treatment will have in vivo.

HIG 82 cells American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. are cultured in Ham s F 12 medium supplemented with 10 by volume fetal bovine serum 50 ug ml penicillin streptomycin and 1 mM L glutamine InVitrogen . Cells are grown in 150 mm vented flasks Nunc and maintained in a humidified atmosphere 37 C. with 5 CO. HIG 82 cells are detached from the bottom of the flask by first washing twice with 10 ml Ca Mg free D PBS followed by the addition of 5 ml of a 1 5000 dilution stock of versene InVitrogen . The versene treated cells are washed by centrifugation 200 g 7 minutes and gently resuspended in media.

The experimental protocol for measuring MMP s and NO in supernatants from HIG 82 cells cultures is based on procedures published by Panagakos et al. 2000 as well as Kolomyikin et al. 2002 . Briefly 2.0 10cells in 2 ml of media will be added to each well of a 12 well plate Nunc and grown to confluency. When cells are confluent media will be aspirated out of the wells and 1 ml of serum free media is added. Twenty four hours later the synovial fibroblasts will be treated with inflammatory mediators in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of COG133. After an additional 24 hr the supernatants will be harvested and assayed for nitric oxide TNF alpha as well as MMP s 1 3 9 and 13.

In order to test if COG133 or COG1410 will inhibit TNF alpha production from synovial fibroblasts HIG 82 cells will be activated with LPS 0.001 0.01 and 0.1 ug ml in the presence or absence of COG133 or COG1410 0.1 0.5 1 3 10 and 25 uM . Supernatants will be collected and analyzed with a commercially available rabbit TNF alpha ELISA kit BD Biosciences . As with the MMP and NO experiments time course studies will be conducted to determine the peak time of TNF alpha production prior to testing COG133 or COG1410.

It is our goal to test vehicle reverse peptide COG1410 or COG133 or other ApoE mimetic peptide treated synovial fibroblasts for TNF alpha MMP and NO production after stimulation with multiple doses of each proinflammatory mediator at a concentrations and incubation times that are optimal for each assay. Preliminary experiments will establish the optimal concentrations and incubation times for activating HIG 82 cells with LPS 055 B5 Sigma IL 1Beta R D Systems or TNF alpha R D Systems as well as co treatment of cultures with IL 1Beta and TNF alpha.

Pillinger et al. 2000 used recombinant human IL 1Beta or TNF alpha at 20 ng ml to activate the HIG 82 cells in assays for MMP s MMP 1 and 13 and NO. Optimal times for MMP production by HIG 82 cells is reported to range from 14 48 hours. The concentration of human IL 1B used to stimulate peak MMP production also varied 0.001 20 ng ml Panagakos et al. 2000 Kolomytkin et al. 2002 Pillinger et al. 2004 . Once optimal conditions for production of TNF alpha NO and MMP s 1 3 9 and 13 have been established a minimum of 3 independent experiments will be performed in replicates of 4 as summarized in Table 3. A sub optimal optimal and high dose of each mediator will be tested. Statistical significance will be determined using ANOVA followed by Dunnetts t test.

Assay for matrix metalloprotease MMP activity We propose to measure MMP s 1 3 9 and 13 using a method developed at Cognosci multiple enzyme multiple reagent assays system MEMRAS Rasmussen et al. 2004 . MEMRAS enables the measurement of the activity of multiple MMP s in a single sample. Data will be expressed as the mean concentration S.E.M. of each MMP detected in each experimental group.

Assay for NO Supernatants from cell culture experiments will be assayed using the Greiss reagent system Promega Madison Wis. to measure a stable nonvolatile degradation product of nitric oxide nitrite NO . Data will be expressed as the mean percentage S.E.M. of the positive control cells plus LPS or cytokine .

Assay for Rabbit TNF alpha Antibody pairs for capture and detection of rabbit TNF alpha as well as rabbit TNF alpha standard are commercially available BD Biosciences and will be used according to the manufacturers instructions to quantify the amount of TNF alpha that HIG 82 cells produce. Data will be expressed the mean percentage S.E.M. of the positive control cells plus LPS or cytokine .

To ensure that any reductions in the amounts MMP s NO or TNF alpha we observe are not due to cell death viability assays will be performed on HIG 82 cells under all the experimental conditions proposed using the MTT assay Promega Madison Wis. .

Thirty minutes following TBI mice were treated with 406 g kg COG133 or saline vehicle. At 24 hours post injury the saline injected animals exhibited a profound deficit in motor coordination and balance as measured by the rotorod test . This motor deficit was associated with weight loss data not shown . Mice treated with COG133 performed significantly better on each day than their saline treated counterparts p

In addition to gross testing of acute recovery of neurological function with rotorod Applicants also measured chronic recovery at 20 days after TBI by studying changes in performance in the Morris Water Maze task Morris 1984 . This task measures the ability of the animal to incorporate visual spatial cues into working and reference memory. Performance on this task is a correlate of the neuropsychiatric deficit seen in a human clinical population for head injury Skelton et al. 2000 . As depicted in head injured mice treated intravenously with COG133 performed significantly better on days 23 and 24 than injured animals receiving intravenous saline vehicle as a control p

In previous work Applicants demonstrated that COG133 exhibited a dose dependent suppression of LPS stimulated nitrite secretion in BV2 murine microglial cells. As depicted in 50 suppression was achieved at a dose of approximately 3 M COG133. For Applicants preliminary work the two most common PTDs TAT and penetratin were used. As depicted in the TAT COG133 conjugate was not effective in the range of 25 1000 nM. Doses greater than 1000 nM resulted in death of greater than 90 of cells data not shown . illustrates that the penetratin COG133 conjugate was significantly more potent than COG133. Fifty percent suppression by penetratin COG133 COG4502 occurred at approximately 30 nM whereas COG133 alone did not achieve 50 suppression within the dose range utilized in this experiment. Comparison of the data in with that in in which 50 suppression was achieved at 3 M indicate that the efficacy of COG133 was increased about 100 fold when conjugated to penetratin COG4502 . These preliminary data indicate that TAT COG133 was cytotoxic whereas penetratin COG133 COG4502 significantly increased the efficacy of COG133 in BV2 microglial cells.

To further determine the efficacy of PTD conjugated COG133s BV2 cells were treated with various concentrations of the PTD COG133s see Table 7 for PTD and COG 133 sequences and NO production was quantified and normalized based on cell viability. As depicted in conjugation of COG133 to all of the PTDs tested enhanced the efficacy of COG133 to varying degrees. The IC50 i.e. the concentration of a PTD COG133 conjugate that resulted in 50 suppression of NO production relative to untreated controls was determined for each compound. As depicted in and detailed in Table 7 COG133 was barely able to reduce NO production to 50 of untreated controls at the highest concentration tested i.e. 25 M whereas antpCOG133 did so at a dose of 0.7 M and achieved 100 suppression at 25 M. Interestingly the truncated antp PTD i.e. antp 52 58 which was reportedly as effective as full length antp in other in vitro studies Fisher et al. 2000 exhibited significantly reduced efficacy with an IC50 of 11 M. SynB3 SynB5 and 8R enhanced the activity of COG133 to similar degrees with IC50s of 5.9 M 3.2 M and 4 M respectively. AntpCOG133 was the most effective conjugate resulting in a 40 fold increase in potency relative to COG133.

Mice were administered COG133 TAT COG133 or penetratin COG133 COG4502 at varying times following TBI and the effects were analyzed by performance on the rotorod task. The results depicted in suggest that conjugation of COG133 to penetratin can increase the therapeutic window of COG133 whereas treatment with TAT COG133 was not effective and was similar to saline data not shown . These data are consistent with the results obtained screening the activity of COG conjugates in BV2 cells thereby establishing the validity of the BV2 cells as a primary screen for COG activity.

Applicants have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that COG133 exhibits anti inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Though the mechanism of transport is likely through one or more of the known apoE receptors it is clear that PTDs such as penetratin possess the capability to transport cargo across cell membranes and in some cases across the BBB. Preliminary data in BV2 cells and in vivo form the solid base upon which Applicants propose to test the hypothesis that conjugation of COG133 to various PTDs can increase the efficacy and therapeutic window of COG133. Currently there are no definitive neuroprotective agents available to treat TBI. This is a first step in a strategy for the development of a novel PTD as a platform delivery vehicle. The enhanced delivery through the BBB afforded by a novel PTD analog will expand the range neurological disorders that can be treated with COG133 to include those that lack the overt BBB breach seen in TBI. In addition the ability of COG133 to transcytose will enhance its activity systemically potentially enabling COG133 to enjoy broad application as an anti inflammatory therapeutic agent.

Experimental Design A randomized design is used where the independent variable is the PTD and the dependent variable will be levels of nitric oxide present in the culture media.

Synthesis of PTD COG133 Conjugates Peptides are synthesized by New England Peptides or other suitable vendor to a purity of 95 and reconstituted in sterile isotonic PBS. Each PTD is appended to the N terminus of COG133 whose sequence is LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL SEQ ID NO. 1 . Note that COG133 possesses 5 arginines. The presence of arginines which are reportedly crucial for transcytosis of PTDs suggest that COG133 can itself possess characteristics of PTDs and or can facilitate PTD transport.

Cell Culture BV 2 a well characterized murine microglial cell line Bochinni 1992 is cultured in high glucose content DMEM supplemented with 1 penicillin streptomycin 10 fetal calf serum 1 nonessential amino acids and 1 sodium pyruvate. Cells are grown to confluency trypsinized spun down resuspended in serum free OptiMEM containing 1 N2 supplement 1 penicillin streptomycin 1 nonessential amino acids and 1 sodium pyruvate and plated at a concentration of 20 000 cells well to remove any nonadherent cells and serum.

LPS Stimulation of Cells and Treatment with PTD COG133s BV2 cells are washed with OptiMEM to assure the removal of serum covered with 200 l of fresh OptiMEM and then treated with a range of concentrations of PTD COG133 or appropriately diluted ammonium bicarbonate vehicle control solution and 100 ng ml LPS from Catalog No. L8274 Sigma . Supernatant is collected 24 and or 48 h after LPS stimulation and assayed for nitrite.

Quantification of Nitric Oxide NO Accumulation of nitrite stable end product of NO production in the medium is measured by colometric Griess reagent system Promega the absorbance is determined at 540 nm.

Cell Viability Assay Cell viability is measured using a nonradioactive cell viability assay cell titer 96 AQ Promega . The assay measures the bioreduction of MTS 3 4 5 dimethylthiazole 2 5 3 carboxymethoxyphenyl 2 4 sulfophenyl 2H tetrazolium by viable cells into formazan. The absorbance of the calorimetric assay is measured at 490 nm. Viability is assessed and used to normalize the nitrite data.

Data Collection and Statistical Analysis Experiments are carried out on a minimum of six wells analyzed per experimental condition for a minimum of three different culture groups. Values may be expressed as mean SEM. Significance will be determined using the unpaired Student s t test or ANOVA.

Experimental Design A randomized design is used with two independent variables a time elapsed between injury and treatment i.e. 30 60 90 and 180 minutes and b the top three PTD COG133 conjugates based performance in BV 2 cells. The dependent variables will be rotorod score and weight.

Head Injury Model with Controlled Pneumatic Impact Device Mice are anesthetized with 4.3 isoflurane in oxygen at a FiO2 of 50 in an anesthesia induction box for 90 seconds. The trachea are intubated and the lungs mechanically ventilated and anesthetized with 1.4 isoflurane in 50 Oand 50 N. Body temperature is maintained at 37 C. using surface heating cooling. Each mouse is positioned in a stereotactic device. The top of the skull is exposed to identify anatomical landmarks. Animals are subjected to controlled skull impact with a pneumatic impactor Air Power High Point N.C. using a 2.0 mm steel tip impounder at a controlled velocity 6.0 0.2 m sec and vertical displacement 3.0 mm . The animals will be allowed to recover spontaneous ventilation prior to extubation. Following recovery mice will be allowed free access to food and water Lynch et al. 2001a b .

Drug Administration At 30 60 90 or 180 minutes following TBI mice are intravenously injected with 100 ul of sterile phosphate buffered saline vehicle COG133 at a dose of 1 mg kg or various PTD COG133 conjugates at a dose of 1 mg kg. Based on previous experience 20 animals per experimental treatment group will be employed to obtain enough data to be able to make significant statistical comparisons.

Rotorod Test The Rotorod Test is given about 2 hours before experimentally applied TBI. Briefly each mouse is lifted by the tail and gently placed on the rotating rod that is revolving at a slow and constant speed. After 5 to 10 seconds the rotating rod is switched to acceleration mode and a timer is started. The timer is stopped when the mouse falls off of the rotating rod or when the mouse has held onto the rod and rotated twice around 720 degrees of rotation . After a 5 minute rest period a second trial ise performed by placing the same mouse on the rotating rod again and the latency or time spent on the rotating rod is measured again. After another 5 minute rest period a third trial is performed and the latency time will be measured for each mouse again. On the day following TBI approximately 20 to 24 hours post impaction and then every day for the next five days each mouse is tested by 3 trials on the rotorod test as described below thereby enabling each mouse to serve as his own control. For data analysis the 3 latency times for each mouse in a group of mice are averaged together and standard deviations calculated. This testing paradigm was selected based on our previous research on TBI which demonstrated that it possesses the sensitivity to detect the presence of post traumatic dysfunction and subsequent recovery Lynch et al. 2001a b . All tests are conducted by an investigator blinded to group assignment.

Data Collection and Statistical Analysis Values may be expressed as mean SEM. Significance is determined using the unpaired Student s t test or ANOVA.

Data depicted in indicate that SynB3 COG133 conjugate significantly improves outcome from head trauma in mice when administered by a single tail vein injection at 2 hours post traumatic brain injury as measured by rotorod latency .

To test whether a peptide derived from ApoE holo protein could confer the same anti inflammatory activities as holo ApoE protein we initially showed that addition of COG133 aka. ApoE 133 149 or ApoE 130 149 resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of TNF release from a BV2 microglial cell line stimulated with lipopolysaccharide LPS Laskowitz et al. 2001 . In contrast cells treated with a scrambled peptide failed to inhibit TNF release. Similarly COG133 and Apoe 130 149 significantly reduced nitric oxide release from LPS treated BV2 cells while scrambled peptide treatments failed to inhibit nitric oxide release. These data demonstrated that the release of a cytokine TNF and of a free radical NO following LPS induced stimulation of macrophagic cells is significantly reduced in the presence of COG133 indicating that COG133 may function as an anti inflammatory agent. See U.S. application Ser. No. 10 252 120 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

We next investigated whether COG133 apoE 133 149 would suppress inflammatory responses in whole animals Lynch et al. 2003 in the same fashion as in cell based models Laskowitz et al. 2001 . When co administered with LPS the COG133 apoE mimetic peptide significantly reduced serum TNF and serum IL 6 levels. In addition to suppression of cytokine release in the periphery we also investigated the effects of tail vein injection of LPS plus COG133 on cytokine mRNA levels in the brains of wild type mice Lynch et al. 2003 . Compared to LPS plus saline TNF and IL6 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in animals at 3 hours post injection of LPS plus COG133 showing that administration of COG133 an apoE mimetic peptide can significantly suppress LPS induced inflammation in a whole animal model.

In order to confirm that the anti inflammatory effects of ApoE would be useful for the protection of subjects undergoing TBI and radiotherapy we compared the effects of 7 Gy and 8 Gy of TBI in wild type C57Bl 6 mice that express mouse ApoE protein to the effects of 7 Gy and 8 Gy of TBI in ApoE knockout mice Jackson Labs Bar Harbor Me. . Groups of 10 mice were irradiated at time 0 and their survival followed over the next 36 days. As shown in none of the wild type mice exposed to 7 Gy died during the 30 day time course while 2 of the 10 apoE knockout mice died 20 mortality 80 survival on Day 13 post irradiation with no further deaths during the 30 day time course. When a group of 10 wild type mice were exposed to 8 Gy of TBI 4 died on Day 21 post irradiation and 2 more died on Day 23 with no more deaths out to Day 36. When a group of 10 apoE knockout mice were exposed to 8 Gy of TBI 6 died on Day 10 post irradiation 2 more died on Day 11 and the last 2 died on Day 12.

There are several ways to summarize this 8 Gy TBI data A maximum of 100 of apoE knockout mice die by Day 12 post irradiation compared to a maximum of 60 of wild type mice die by Day 23 post irradiation. Alternatively 60 of apoE knockout mice die by Day 10 post irradiation compared to 60 of wild type mice die by Day 23 post irradiation. From either representation of the data it is clear that the absence of apoE protein in APOE knockout mice is associated with death at an earlier time and a greater percentage of APOE knockout animals die at a given dose of TBI compared to their wild type apoE containing counterparts. This finding suggested to the present inventors that ApoE protein confers a protective effect that enhances survival of whole animals following TBI and is consistent with previous experiments suggesting that ApoE deficiency may exacerbate the behavioral toxicity of high charge high energy HZE particle exposure Higuchi et al. 2002 .

Total Body Irradiation is associated with a significant increase in whole body inflammation. We and others have found a significant increase in the levels of cytokines in the blood of mice exposed to TBI Budagov 2004 and unpublished . A recent report by Budagov and Ul ianova 2004 found that administration of an anti IL6 monoclonal antibody to mice receiving 7.5 Gy of TBI plus a 10 body surface full thickness burn resulted in significantly improved survival to the 60 level at 30 days post injury compared to 100 lethality in mice exposed to the same injury and not receiving anti IL6 monoclonals. An excellent report from Van der Meeren et al. 2002 showed that mice receiving 8 Gy of TBI followed by a 2 hour delay and then receiving rIL11 every day for 5 days were significantly protected from death. Specifically at 30 days post TBI the rIL11 treated group enjoyed a 74 survival rate while placebo treated controls only reached an 11 survival fraction p

Based on the role that apoE plays in inflammation we have created COG133 which is a small peptide possessing the tissue protective activity of holo apoE Laskowitz et al. 2001 Lynch et al. 2003 Lynch et al. 2005 . Using lipopolysaccharide LPS induced inflammation in a wild type mouse treatment with COG133 significantly reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha TNFa and interleukin 6 IL6 release in the blood and in the brain when compared to their wild type counterparts treated with LPS and saline vehicle. In another wild type mouse model where inflammation is induced following experimentally applied traumatic brain injury we reported that COG133 was effective in significantly preventing death and restoring behavioral function when given 30 minutes AFTER the traumatic brain injury Lynch et al. 2005 . In more recent studies we have found that COG133 administered by an intraperitoneal route is also effective at reducing the inflammation see after LPS injection in mice data not shown . Our results indicate that COG133 can effectively reduce inflammation in the presence of endogenous levels of naturally occurring apoE protein and can do so even though COG133 is administered AFTER the inflammatory stimulus.

Combining the information that TBI stimulates inflammation and that cog133 an apoE mimetic can modulate inflammation in a whole animal we tested the ability of cog133 to improve survival in wild type mice exposed to total body irradiation.

From independent studies that we have performed the maximum tolerated dose of COG133 is 14 mg Kg data not shown . This maximum tolerated dose is the dose at which no animal dies within 24 hours of tail vein injection of the COG133. We have also reported that LPS mediated TNFa and IL6 levels were significantly reduced by co administration of COG133 Lynch et al. 2003 . Thus we will administer amounts doses of COG133 which range between zero and one half the maximum tolerated dose 0 to 0.5 MTD to mice receiving 0 to 12 grey of total body irradiation TBI . In this way the effects of TBI alone the effects of COG133 alone and the effects of TBI plus COG133 can be compared.

The range of radiation doses to be initially tested 0 to 12 Gy will cover both intermediate and low dose irradiation Hall 2000 . At intermediate doses of radiation 5 to 12 Gy death is expected to occur in a matter of days and is associated with diarrhea and destruction of the gastrointestinal mucosa termed gastrointestinal syndrome . At low doses of radiation approximately 2.5 to 5 Gy death occurs several weeks after exposure and is caused by effects on the blood forming organs termed bone marrow death or hematopoietic syndrome . Thus one would expect earlier gastrointestinal syndrome in the higher dose groups and delayed hematopoietic syndrome in the lower dose groups.

As shown in wild type mice that express apoE protein suffer an LDwhen exposed to 10 Gy of TBI ie. 100 of the mice exposed to 10 Gy of TBI die at 12 days post irradiation . In contrast mice receiving a single intraperitoneal injection of COG133 4 mg Kg in saline at 1 minute post TBI 10 Gy display better survival with an LDwhich is better than their saline treated counterparts. If we administer 10 Gy of TBI to the mice followed by a 1 hour delay and then an initial administration of COG133 4 mg Kg followed by additional administrations of COG133 on day 1 day 2 and day 3 post TBI survival was further enhanced with an LDwhich is significantly better than their saline treated counterparts p

These data show that exposure of C57B16 mice to TBI followed by administration of COG133 resulted in an extension of life span compared to mice that received radiation and saline vehicle lacking COG133. Although none of these animals lived to 30 days we employed a higher dose of 10 Gy which gave 100 lethality in saline treated mice at 12 days post irradiation LD . Even though all animals receiving 10 Gy followed by treatment with COG133 also died they died by day 14 and by day 16 survival times which apparently related to the paradigm by which COG133 was administered. Animals receiving 4 doses of COG133 survived a significantly longer time following irradiation then the saline vehicle treated control group when analyzed by ANOVA p

We will also perform these experiments in wild type C57Bl 6 mice that express mouse apoE protein. We will be testing whether the addition of COG133 to these wild type apoE containing mice will improve their survival. We feel this is important because a radioprotection therapy such as COG133 would potentially be given to humans who already have apoE protein. We considered doing experiments in APOE knockout mice with COG133 but felt that this was a lower bar and would not meet the long term criteria of a therapy that could be given to humans that already expressed their own endogenous apoE protein.

Peptide Synthesis Peptides are synthesized by Multiple Peptide Systems San Diego to a purity of 95 as confirmed by mass spectrometry and are reconstituted from a trifluoracetic acid salt. COG133 has the sequence LRVRLASHLRKLRKRLL SEQ ID No. 1 and Reverse COG133 has the sequence LLRKRLKRLHSALRVRL SEQ ID No. 57 .

Treatment Conditions In general each treatment group will consist of 12 male C57BL 6 mice at 12 to 16 weeks of age. We will administer doses of COG133 corresponding to 0 MTD ie. saline vehicle 0.1 MTD 0.2 MTD and 0.5 MTD 0 2.6 5.2 and 13 mg Kg total of 50 mg for this expt. Table 8 . The initial intraperitoneal administration of COG133 will be 1 hour AFTER total body irradiation ie. 1 hour post TBI and will be followed by daily injections for a total of 30 days or until the animal dies. Based on values from the literature and our own preliminary data with TBI we will employ 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 Gy of total body ionizing irradiation with each of the different doses of COG133 listed above. Thus 4 amounts of COG133 times 8 different amounts of radiation gives 32 different conditions. 32 different conditions times 12 mice per condition will total 384 mice. To receive total body irradiation TBI mice are placed in a calibrated irradiator and exposed for a length time to generate the desired dose of ionizing radiation as was done in the Preliminary Results section above. Saline alone and all compounds will be administered in sterile physiological saline vehicle via intraperitoneal injection at 60 minutes post TBI and then each day for 30 days QD dosing of COG133 .

Animal Assessment Survival of animals will be measured in a variety of ways. Death is the lack of survival which we define as a complete lack of breathing and complete unresponsiveness to external stimuli such as tail pinch and or toe pinch for a period of 10 or more minutes. Survival will be assessed in each animal on a daily basis for each of the 30 days following TBI exposure. Animals will be weighed on an electronic scale each day for three days preceding TBI and on each day for the 30 days following TBI.

Clinical signs are observations related to CNS activity of the animal motor activity ataxia righting reflex and convulsions and are early indicators of toxicity or morbidity. These observations can be used to assess ability of animals to perform following TBI and whether this performance is improved with COG133. We will use the Modified Neuro Severity Scoring system to give a Summary Neuro Severity Score NSS as described by Dr. Laskowitz our collaborator Sheng et al. 1999 . Each animal will be assessed on each of the three days before TBI and on each of the 30 days following TBI. A trained observer who is blinded as to group assignment performs these assessments. A score of 0 points means normal neurological exam and a score of 10 points means the most severe neurological deficit. Values are summarized as Summary NSS Scores as follows 1 normal 0 points 2 moderate deficit 1 6 points 3 severe deficit 7 10 points 4 dead. Between assessments animals will then be returned to their cages and allowed free access to food and water. Neuro severity scores will be compared by use of the Mann Whitney U statistic.

Animals that appear to be exhibiting signs of undue distress they will be immediately euthanized as per the guidelines of the IACUC for human use and care of animals. Measurements of non lethal morbidity will be addressed in Example 4. Mortality data were analyzed by comparing the survival curves of treated and untreated animals using the log rank test and or Fisher s exact test two sided . Statistical analysis of survival data will be compared between all groups with the Prism computer program. Significance will be determined using the unpaired Student s t test or ANOVA with statistical significance assumed when p

Dose Reduction Factor Hall 2000 defines DRF as the ratio of radiation dose in the presence of an agent such as COG133 to the radiation dose in the absence of an agent such as COG133 for the same level of effect such as LD . Thus DRF dose of radiation in presence of COG133 divided by the dose of radiation in the absence of COG133 to produce a 50 level of lethality 50 survival . Using the data collected from the above study we will plot survival versus exposure curves from which the dose of total body irradiation that gives 50 survival at 30 days post TBI can be interpolated Henschke and Morton 1957 . Using the LDfrom saline control animals and the LDfor 0.1 MTD of COG133 0.2 MTD of COG133 and 0.5 MTD of COG133 we will calculate the DRF for each amount of COG133. If the DRF is greater than 1 this result would suggest that treatment of animals with COG133 post TBI has a protective effect on animal survival following exposure to TBI. If the DRF is 1 then no protection is afforded by COG133 treatment. If the DRF is less than 1 then COG133 may be acting as an agent that sensitizes animals to TBI. Based on our preliminary studies in we predict that COG133 will act as a radio protector that significantly increases the survival of mice exposed to TBI and will generate a DRF of greater than 1.

Mice are the animals of choice for this proof of principle experiment because they respond consistently to TBI are small enough to conveniently fit into an irradiator machine and they their small size conserves on the use of COG133 in this testing paradigm. In order to accurately determine the effect of COG133 in subsequent tasks we must generate a complete radiation dosage versus survival fraction curve for each treatment condition. With respect to mice TBI exposures of less than 4 Gy typically have no measurable effect on survival and thus we have not chosen to expend precious animal resources on those low dose experiments in this proposal. However different outcomes from low dose irradiation studies could be the subject of future proposals. On the other end TBI exposures of more than 10 Gy typically result in less than 10 survival greater than 90 death . Although responses of animals to greater than 10 Gy is important for both military and civilian reasons we have chosen to focus on the range of exposures which are also significantly associated with animal death. If our treatment interventions can significantly improve survival at these low to intermediate doses of TBI then future proposals will focus on the potential for protection of survival following higher does of TBI such as those above 10 Gy of TBI.

Schedule of Experiments One group of 48 animals will be tested approximately every 6 weeks for the one year duration of the project. Thus the following schedule is proposed

In overview mice will be tested on the wire hang test to show that they have strength in their limbs. If they do have strength then they will then be tested on rotorod which is an integrated test of behavioral performance of motor strength and coordination. Animals which fail to pass these tests before any stress is applied will not be used in our subsequent studies. If animals receiving TBI plus COG133 perform significantly better than those receiving TBI alone then this will indicate that COG133 may not only improve mortality but may improve morbidity as well.

Wire Hang Testing To assess the prehensile reflex and general motor strength the wire hang test will be used. In our version of this test mice are picked up by the tail and placed on the wire lid of a standard shoe box cage this consists of parallel stainless steel wires of approximately 2 mm diameter placed about 1 cm apart that covers the entire top of the 20 cm 30 cm shoe box . The mouse typically grasps the wires on the lid and the entire lid with the mouse holding on is inverted at about 20 to 30 cm above the top of a foam rubber pad sitting on top of the bench. The mouse is allowed to remain grasping the lid for 30 seconds. If the mouse fails to grasp the lid and falls off before 30 seconds the time from inversion to falling off is recorded as the latency time. If the mouse does not fall off then it is given a 30 second latency time. Three trials are performed for each mouse on each day for the three days before TBI. Each trial is separated by at least 5 minutes as a rest period. The average latency time and standard deviation are calculated for each group on each day. Wire hang is also performed in the same way on each day following TBI. If animals are unable to successfully perform wire hang and to hold onto the wire lid for the entire 30 seconds on each trial on each of the three days preceding TBI they will be excluded from TBI and further studies. Our experience has been that all healthy wild type C57Bl 6 mice easily pass this test.

Rotorod Testing Daily Rotorod RR testing will be used to assess short term motor and cerebellar deficit following total body irradiation Hamm et al. 1994 . The Rotorod Test will be given each day for 3 days before TBI and each day for 30 days following TBI. Briefly each mouse will be lifted by the tail and gently placed on the rotating rod that is revolving at a slow and constant speed. After 5 to 10 seconds the rotating rod will be switched to acceleration mode and a timer will be started. The timer will be stopped when the mouse falls off of the rotating rod or when the mouse has held onto the rod and rotated twice around 720 degrees of rotation . After a 5 minute rest period a second trial will be performed by placing the same mouse on the rotating rod again and the latency or time spent on the rotating rod will be measured again. After another 5 minute rest period a third trial was performed and the latency time will be measured for each mouse again.

On each day each mouse will be tested by 3 trials per day on the rotorod test as described above thereby enabling each mouse to serve as his own control. For data analysis the 3 latency times for each mouse in a group of mice will be averaged together and standard deviations calculated. This testing paradigm was selected based on our previous experience with behavioral performance which demonstrated that rotorod possesses the sensitivity to detect the presence of post traumatic dysfunction and subsequent recovery. An investigator blinded to group assignment will conduct all tests. We will employ repeated measures ANOVA with the Prism statistical analysis program to calculate the significance of the differences between groups of mice receiving an experimental compound and those receiving saline controls where p

Based on the anti inflammatory properties of apoE protein we developed COG133 which is a peptide derived from amino acid residues 133 149 located in the receptor binding region of the 299 amino acid apoE holoprotein Laskowitz D T et al. 2001 . We demonstrated that COG133 retains the anti inflammatory properties of the apoE holoprotein using cultured macrophages Laskowitz D T et al. 2001 and C57Bl 6 mice Lynch J. R. et al. 2003 . Inflammation was elicited in na ve mice by LPS injection COG133 and serum harvested at 0 1 3 and 24 hours after injection and B . Using cytokine ELISA kits Pierce COG133 treated animals had significantly less serum TNF and significantly less serum IL 6 compared to saline controls Lynch J. R. et al. 2003 . We also reported in Lynch et al. that brain levels of TNF and IL 6 were significantly less in COG133 treated animals compared to saline controls by measurement of either protein levels or of mRNA levels by quantitative RT PCR. LPS stimulation of fresh human blood COG133 also showed that COG133 significantly reduced nitric oxide and TNF levels compared to saline treated controls data not shown . These data show that COG133 reduces inflammation in vitro in vivo and ex vivo which supports our idea that COG133 may effectively reduce inflammation in human disease.

MOG induced Experimental Allergic Enchephalomyelitis EAE in mice is one of the most frequently used murine models of the inflammation associated with Multiple Sclerosis MS because the clinical and histopathological features of MS and EAE are regarded as similar in many essential respects. These include clinical manifestations the occurrence of multifocal lesion throughout the CNS demyelinating plaques perivascular inflammation and involvement of invading inflammatory cells that release inflammogens like TNF IL 6 and NO Ransohoff R. M. 1999 . Thus this model was chosen to test our hypothesis that COG133 may ameliorate the impairment of MS through its anti inflammatory property.

Briefly C57BL 6 female mice were first immunized with MOG peptide pMOG MEVGWYRSPFSRV VHLYRNGK SEQ. ID. NO. 64 and starting from day 6 to day 24 after immunization 1 mg kg of COG133 or reverse COG133 or same volume of normal saline was administered by tail vein bolus injection every other day. In total 10 doses of peptides were given. We found that COG133 significantly ameliorates the severity of EAE by showing that the mean maximum clinical score in COG133 treated animals is significantly lower than in saline control animals . COG133 treatment also significantly reduced the mortality from 4 of 15 in saline group and 5 of 15 in reverse peptide group to 0 of 15 in COG133 treated group p0.05 but there is a statistically significant improvement in the COG133 group when compared to either control group p

To show pathological changes including invading inflammatory cells the animals were sacrificed on day 30 whole spinal cords were dissected out and 5 m thick sections were made from cervical thoracic and lumbar segments of spinal cords of COG133 treated animals and saline treated controls. These sections were stained with Luxol fast blue for myelin stained in blue and then counterstained with eosin showing peripheral infiltrates in red purple . As shown in B and C massive demyelination loss of blue staining and enhanced infiltrates shown in red purple particles can be observed in white matter throughout spinal cord in control animals. Consistent with behavioral changes COG133 reduced demyelination and reduced inflammatory infiltrates in MOG treated animals E F H .

Using COG133 as a template we continue to generate new analogs with enhanced and desirable pharmaceutical properties. As shown in COG1410 is a analog that contains non natural amino acids and is able to suppress NO release in LPS stimulated BV2 microglia cells better than the COG133 parent compound. Similarly COG4502 is another analog that contains a prefix of extra amino acids followed by the COG133 sequence and is able to suppress NO release in this system much better than the COG133 parent. To further validate the utility of COG4502 in a more physiological system we isolated mouse peritoneal macrophages and stimulated them with LPS in the presence or absence of COG4502. As shown in COG4502 produces a dose dependent inhibition of TNFa release and a dose dependent inhibition of IL6 release. These results strongly indicate that COG compounds are potent anti inflammatory molecules on cell lines on peritoneal macrophages and in whole animals as detailed above .

Inflammation underlies the progression and symptoms of Crohn s Disease and ulcerative colitis in some cases this can progress to complications of stricture formation fistulas obstruction and perforation. Part of this inflammatory response in IBD is the stimulation of NO release which has been generally linked to worsening of disease activity. NO is generated by NO synthases NOS from arginine as a substrate and the inducible form of this enzyme iNOS is the major player implicated in IBD. Arginine however can also be used by an alternative pathway to generate polyamines. This sets up a competition between the two pathways for a limiting arginine substrate.

The Wilson Lab has been focusing on the competing activities of the iNOS and the arginase ODC pathways in mucosal immunology Cross R K et al. 2003 Gobert A P et al. 2004 Chaturvedi R. et al. 2004 Xu H. et al. 2004 Bussiere F I et al. 2005 Gobert A P et al. 2001 2002 Cheng Y. et al. 2005 . Mouse models of colitis have been used to discover that the alternative arginase ornithine decarboxylase ODC pathway leads to the formation of polyamines in the colon which play an important role in the amelioration of colitis Gobert et al. 2004 . It has been shown that either iNOS deficient mice lacking the enzyme to make high levels of NO or wild type mice administered supplemental arginine to increase the amount of arginine entering the alternative pathway demonstrate improved colitis induced by or dextran sulfate sodium DSS . Furthermore treatment of iNOS deficient mice with arginine resulted in dramatic improvement of disease and reversal of pro inflammatory cytokine production. In contrast treatment of mice with inhibitors of arginase or ODC causes a dramatic worsening of colitis. These data suggest that there is a competition for arginine at the site of disease where arginine metabolism to NO makes matters worse while arginine metabolism to polyamines ameliorates the disease. Based on this indication therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing NO production and or increasing polyamine synthesis should be effective treatments for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.

Induction of arginase I and iNOS. When we studied the expression of the arginase and iNOS enzymes in colitis tissues we found that arginase I mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased while arginase II was not induced and B . These data were confirmed by real time PCR where we found a 9.7 2.5 fold increase for arginase I but no increase for arginase II. iNOS mRNA was also consistently increased by RT PCR and this was confirmed by real time PCR as well. By immunohistochemistry we found focally intense staining for arginase I in colonic tissues of infected mice as shown in and 29H. Staining was present in epithelial cells and C but was also found throughout the mucosa in severe colitis with staining of infiltrating inflammatory cells. In serial sections from the same tissues iNOS localized to the epithelium and the lamina propria and submucosal inflammatory cells and 291 . Staining was absent in uninfected tissues with Ab to arginase I or iNOS or in infected tissues incubated with an isotype Ig control . iNOS staining was completely absent in tissues from iNOS mice data not shown .

We were able to confirm that arginase activity was increased by 2.4 fold in infected vs. control mice . A significant increase in NO concentration was observed in the serum of infected mice compared to control mice . A concomitant marked decrease of L Arg concentration was observed in the serum of infected mice . These data indicate that under conditions of significant intestinal inflammation as in the model there was a near complete depletion of systemic arginine.

Contrasting Role of iNOS and Arginase Amelioration of Clinical Parameters by L Ar Supplementation and iNOS Deletion

Since arginase I and iNOS were both abundantly expressed in the colitis tissues and L Arg was completely metabolized we investigated the effect of administration of 1 L Arg in the drinking water. In wild type WT mice colitis induced a high level of mortality that began on day 9 post infection . In WT animals treated with L Arg mortality was inhibited by 42 and 62 compared to mice receiving water alone after 12 and 14 days of infection respectively . By Cox regression analysis WT mice treated with L Arg had only a 31 hazard of death compared with mice receiving water alone p

Induction of Pro Inflammatory Cytokines in Colitis Tissues is Attenuated by L Arg Treatment or iNOS Deletion

Because colitis has been strongly associated with activation of the Th1 cytokine IFN and the associated pro inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL 1 30 46 we sought to determine the relationship between the clinical and histologic effects we observed with these immunologic parameters. Real time PCR analysis demonstrated a marked increase in IFN TNF and IL 1 in colitis tissues compared to normal tissues and a significant attenuation of these increases with either iNOS deletion or L Arg treatment.

Since ornithine the product of arginase is metabolized by ODC to form polyamaines we investigated ODC expression in the colon of infected WT mice. By real time PCR we found a 2.5 0.5 fold increase of mRNA level in infected n 13 compared to control mice n 4 not shown . However a 40 fold increase in ODC activity was measured in the colon of either infected WT or infected WT mice treated with L Arg . This increase was not likely to be due to ODC activity from itself since we measured bacterial ODC activity and determined that it represented no more than 1 of the total ODC activity in the tissue. There was a 1.8 0.1 fold increase in colonic polyamines in infected WT mice and a significant further increase of 2.7 0.2 fold with L Arg treatment indicating that arginase activity was an important determinant of polyamine synthesis. The modest increase in polyamines vs. the larger increase in ODC activity most likely reflects the fact that polyamines are rapidly acetylated leading to efflux out of cells and excretion 31 .

To further demonstrate the beneficial effect of arginase and polyamine formation mice were given S 2 boronoethyl L cysteine BEC or difluoromethylornithine DFMO inhibitors of arginase and ODC respectively in the drinking water. In uninfected control mice BEC or DFMO had no effect Table I . However there was significant loss of survival in infected mice treated with BEC or DFMO Table 9 . In fact experiments had to be terminated early at 10 days post infection because of deaths and severe disease at this point. Colons of BEC and DFMO groups had a greater increase in weight and histologic injury than those of the water group Table 9 .

When compared with the infected WT mice treated with water alone the colons of both the BEC and DFMO treated mice showed marked transmural inflammation and mucin depletion Gobert A P et al. 2004 . The BEC treated mice had substantial submucosal abscess formation and the DFMO treated mice exhibited mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage both indicative of severe acute inflammation. When BEC was given to iNOS infected mice colitis increased compared to iNOS

This model was selected because it has become commonly accepted as a mouse model of colitis and is quite practical to employ since it simply involves adding DSS to the drinking water Moteau O. et al. 2000 Williams K L et al. 2001 Andres P G et al. 2000 Mahler M. et al. 1998 Tesser T G et al. 1998 . In initial experiments we tested a variety of doses in the reported range from the literature of 2.5 to 5 Moteau O. et al. 2000 Williams K L et al. 2001 Andres P G et al. 2000 Mahler M. et al. 1998 Tesser T G et al. 1998 and found that we obtained the most reliable response with 4 DSS. Additionally we found that including DSS in the water for 6 days and then removing it provided us with sufficient surviving mice when the DSS was left in the water for longer consecutive days rates of mortality were too high to have enough mice surviving the procedure that one could reliably analyze the survivors.

Once established we assessed arginase and iNOS expression in mice at day 10 in this model. As shown in as in the model there was up regulation of arginase I but not arginase II mRNA expression and increased iNOS levels. We confirmed that arginase I expression at the protein level by Western blotting and by immunohistochemistry .

Consistent with these data we detected a parallel increase in arginase I mRNA by real time PCR and of arginase enzymatic activity in the colitis tissues data not shown . Similarly there was an increase in ODC mRNA and enzyme activity data not shown .

Consistent with the results above in our model there was again a reduction in clinical parameters of colitis in the DSS model with either iNOS deletion or L Arg administration and when L Arg was given to the iNOS mice there was a further improvement in survival body weight and colon weight . These data were paralleled by an amelioration of colon histopathology .

Levels of the pro inflammatory cytokines IFN TNF and IL 1 were also induced in DSS colitis tissues and similar to our findings in the model levels were decreased in the mice with reduction of colitis indicating that they are useful markers of disease severity. It is notable that the levels in the iNOS mice were not as reduced as in the L Arg treated mice which parallels the findings of day 10 body weight colon weight and histology in . Taken together these findings suggest that in the DSS model arginine supplementation acting through the arginase pathway is beneficial.

Intriguingly when polyamine levels were assessed there was a consistent increase in those groups with clinical improvement . As in the model addition of L Arg enhanced polyamine levels. However in contrast to there was not an increase in polyamines in the WT mice without L Arg we speculate that this is due to the induction of the polyamine metabolizing enzymes spermine oxidase and spermidine spermine N acetyltransferase SSAT that we have observed in these tissues data not shown .

Consistent with the protective role of arginase in the DSS model when the arginase inhibitor BEC was administered we observed an exacerbation of clinical and histologic parameters of colitis in both WT and iNOS mice data not shown . Finally in human IBD tissues from both ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease we have observed an increase in arginase I and ODC mRNA levels . Unlike the mice there was also an increase in arginase II suggesting that the mitochondrial enzyme is also induced in these tissues.

To initiate studies to verify the likely relevance of the apo E mimetic COG peptides to models of IBD we have tested them in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages activated with . We used bacterial lysates to more closely mimic the bacterial products to which lamina propria macrophages are likely to be exposed. In fact we have observed bacterial aggregates in the subepithelial mucosa in infected mice with regularity see high power view .

Excitingly we have found that with both peptides tested namely COG1410 and COG4502 the antennapedia linked form of COG133 there was inhibition of NO production as measured by nitrite NO levels in macrophage supernatants . For COG1410 cell toxicity was noted at concentrations of 5 M and above so only data at 2 M is shown for COG4502 toxicity was noted at 10 M by the XTT cell viability assay so data in the 0.1 5 M range is shown where toxicity did not occur. Additionally when mRNA levels were assessed with the COG4502 treatment there was a significant concentration dependent inhibition of iNOS mRNA expression.
