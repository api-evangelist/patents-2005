title: System and method for controlling the opacity of multiple windows while browsing
abstract: A method referred to as x-ray browsing for allowing a user to browse through windows on their desktop is provided. Aspects of the invention include responsive to a command, making a first window the window in focus on the display screen and changing the relative opacities between a content portion of the first window and a content portion of the second window. By controlling the opacities a single window can be made opaque while the remaining windows can be made transparent to allow a user to successively navigate among open windows.

Aspects of the present invention are directed generally to window arrangements in an operating system. More particularly aspects of the present invention are directed to a method and system for browsing multiple windows in an operating system where the window in focus is opaque and the windows not in focus are at least partially transparent.

As the use of computers in both the workforce and personal life has increased so has the desire to allow for easier use of them. Many operating systems today utilize a windows based configuration of application programs. Information is displayed on a display screen in what appears to be several sheets of paper.

When multiple windows are open at the same time switching quickly to the desired window can be difficult. For example the desired window may be partially or fully occluded by other open windows. Also the desired window may be minimized or hidden.

Window selection interfaces have been proposed to minimize the necessity to sort through the various open windows. Current versions of the Windows brand operating system by Microsoft Corporation include the Alt Tab key combination Task List and Taskbar which when selected presents a list of open windows in a representation different from the primary window. Similar user interfaces exist in MAC OS X brand operating system by Apple Computing Inc. of Cupertino Calif. including Apple Tab and the Dock in which a list of windows in are provided in a representation different from the primary window. Each of the aforementioned user interfaces restate or reformulate the open windows into a type of list. These interfaces however do not allow the user to view content of a window without the window being selected.

Recently Apple Computing Inc. introduced Expos in the MAC OS X brand operating system. Expos provides a user with the ability to display all open windows as thumbnails on the desktop. In operation when the user types the F9 key Expos tiles all the open windows. Namely Expos scales the windows down to a size such that all the open windows are displayed in a non overlapping form. In another aspect Expos provides a user with the ability to display view all open windows in a particular application in a non overlapping manner. Specifically when the user types the F10 key Expos tiles all of the open windows for the current application in a non overlapping form while fading to a gray all of the open windows associated with other applications.

While Expos allows the user to view open windows simultaneously multiple windows are tiled on the screen which can still lead to some confusion. It would be helpful to provide an interface which allows a user to scan quickly through open windows one at a time where the current window being viewed can maintain its size.

There is therefore a need for a method to allow users to quickly scan through open windows one at a time. According to one aspect of the invention all but one of the open windows is made transparent. The remaining window which is in focus is made opaque and therefore clearly visible. In response to a command windows can be navigated through where each input causes a window previously not in focus to be in focus and become opaque and causes the window in focus at the time of the command to become transparent. Thus at all times during navigation a single window is opaque and the other windows are transparent. This can be referred to as x ray browsing.

According to one aspect a method for concurrently displaying a plurality of windows on a display screen is provided the method includes responsive to a command making a first window the window in focus on the display screen and changing the relative opacities between a content portion of the first window and a content portion of the second window. The opacity of the content portion of the first window is greater than the opacity of the content portion of the second window.

Any of various conventional web browsers can be used to display and manipulate data on web pages.

A programming interface or more simply interface may be viewed as any mechanism process protocol for enabling one or more segment s of code to communicate with or access the functionality provided by one or more other segment s of code. Alternatively a programming interface may be viewed as one or more mechanism s method s function call s module s object s etc. of a component of a system capable of communicative coupling to one or more mechanism s method s function call s module s etc. of other component s . The term segment of code in the preceding sentence is intended to include one or more instructions or lines of code and includes e.g. code modules objects subroutines functions and so on regardless of the terminology applied or whether the code segments are separately compiled or whether the code segments are provided as source intermediate or object code whether the code segments are utilized in a runtime system or process or whether they are located on the same or different machines or distributed across multiple machines or whether the functionality represented by the segments of code are implemented wholly in software wholly in hardware or a combination of hardware and software.

Notionally a programming interface may be viewed generically as shown in or . illustrates an interface Interface as a conduit through which first and second code segments communicate. illustrates an interface as comprising interface objects I and I which may or may not be part of the first and second code segments which enable first and second code segments of a system to communicate via medium M. In the view of one may consider interface objects I and I as separate interfaces of the same system and one may also consider that objects I and I plus medium M comprise the interface. Although show bi directional flow and interfaces on each side of the flow certain implementations may only have information flow in one direction or no information flow as described below or may only have an interface object on one side. By way of example and not limitation terms such as application programming interface API entry point method function subroutine remote procedure call and component object model COM interface are encompassed within the definition of programming interface.

Aspects of such a programming interface may include the method whereby the first code segment transmits information where information is used in its broadest sense and includes data commands requests etc. to the second code segment the method whereby the second code segment receives the information and the structure sequence syntax organization schema timing and content of the information. In this regard the underlying transport medium itself may be unimportant to the operation of the interface whether the medium be wired or wireless or a combination of both as long as the information is transported in the manner defined by the interface. In certain situations information may not be passed in one or both directions in the conventional sense as the information transfer may be either via another mechanism e.g. information placed in a buffer file etc. separate from information flow between the code segments or non existent as when one code segment simply accesses functionality performed by a second code segment. Any or all of these aspects may be important in a given situation e.g. depending on whether the code segments are part of a system in a loosely coupled or tightly coupled configuration and so this list should be considered illustrative and non limiting.

This notion of a programming interface is known to those skilled in the art and is clear from the foregoing detailed description of the invention. There are however other ways to implement a programming interface and unless expressly excluded these too are intended to be encompassed by the claims set forth at the end of this specification. Such other ways may appear to be more sophisticated or complex than the simplistic view of but they nonetheless perform a similar function to accomplish the same overall result. We will now briefly describe some illustrative alternative implementations of a programming interface.

A communication from one code segment to another may be accomplished indirectly by breaking the communication into multiple discrete communications. This is depicted schematically in . As shown some interfaces can be described in terms of divisible sets of functionality. Thus the interface functionality of may be factored to achieve the same result just as one may mathematically provide 24 or 2 times 2 times 3 times 2. Accordingly as illustrated in the function provided by interface Interface may be subdivided to convert the communications of the interface into multiple interfaces InterfaceA InterfaceB InterfaceC etc. while achieving the same result. As illustrated in the function provided by interface I may be subdivided into multiple interfaces I I I etc. while achieving the same result. Similarly interface I of the second code segment which receives information from the first code segment may be factored into multiple interfaces I I I etc. When factoring the number of interfaces included with the 1st code segment need not match the number of interfaces included with the 2nd code segment. In either of the cases of the functional spirit of interfaces Interface and I remain the same as with respectively. The factoring of interfaces may also follow associative commutative and other mathematical properties such that the factoring may be difficult to recognize. For instance ordering of operations may be unimportant and consequently a function carried out by an interface may be carried out well in advance of reaching the interface by another piece of code or interface or performed by a separate component of the system. Moreover one of ordinary skill in the programming arts can appreciate that there are a variety of ways of making different function calls that achieve the same result.

In some cases it may be possible to ignore add or redefine certain aspects e.g. parameters of a programming interface while still accomplishing the intended result. This is illustrated in . For example assume interface Interface of includes a function call Square input precision output a call that includes three parameters input precision and output and which is issued from the 1st Code Segment to the 2nd Code Segment. If the middle parameter precision is of no concern in a given scenario as shown in it could just as well be ignored or even replaced with a meaningless in this situation parameter. One may also add an additional parameter of no concern. In either event the functionality of square can be achieved so long as output is returned after input is squared by the second code segment. Precision may very well be a meaningful parameter to some downstream or other portion of the computing system however once it is recognized that precision is not necessary for the narrow purpose of calculating the square it may be replaced or ignored. For example instead of passing a valid precision value a meaningless value such as a birth date could be passed without adversely affecting the result. Similarly as shown in interface I is replaced by interface I redefined to ignore or add parameters to the interface. Interface I may similarly be redefined as interface I redefined to ignore unnecessary parameters or parameters that may be processed elsewhere. The point here is that in some cases a programming interface may include aspects such as parameters which are not needed for some purpose and so they may be ignored or redefined or processed elsewhere for other purposes.

It may also be feasible to merge some or all of the functionality of two separate code modules such that the interface between them changes form. For example the functionality of may be converted to the functionality of respectively. In the previous 1st and 2nd Code Segments of are merged into a module containing both of them. In this case the code segments may still be communicating with each other but the interface may be adapted to a form which is more suitable to the single module. Thus for example formal Call and Return statements may no longer be necessary but similar processing or response s pursuant to interface Interface may still be in effect. Similarly shown in part or all of interface I from may be written inline into interface I to form interface I . As illustrated interface I is divided into Iand I and interface portion Ihas been coded in line with interface I to form interface I . For a concrete example consider that the interface I from performs a function call square input output which is received by interface I which after processing the value passed with input to square it by the second code segment passes back the squared result with output. In such a case the processing performed by the second code segment squaring input can be performed by the first code segment without a call to the interface.

A communication from one code segment to another may be accomplished indirectly by breaking the communication into multiple discrete communications. This is depicted schematically in . As shown in one or more piece s of middleware Divorce Interface s since they divorce functionality and or interface functions from the original interface are provided to convert the communications on the first interface Interface to conform them to a different interface in this case interfaces InterfaceA InterfaceB and InterfaceC. This might be done e.g. where there is an installed base of applications designed to communicate with say an operating system in accordance with an Interface protocol but then the operating system is changed to use a different interface in this case interfaces InterfaceA InterfaceB and InterfaceC. The point is that the original interface used by the 2nd Code Segment is changed such that it is no longer compatible with the interface used by the 1st Code Segment and so an intermediary is used to make the old and new interfaces compatible. Similarly as shown in a third code segment can be introduced with divorce interface DI to receive the communications from interface I and with divorce interface DI to transmit the interface functionality to for example interfaces Iand I redesigned to work with DI but to provide the same functional result. Similarly DI and DI may work together to translate the functionality of interfaces I and I of to a new operating system while providing the same or similar functional result.

Yet another possible variant is to dynamically rewrite the code to replace the interface functionality with something else but which achieves the same overall result. For example there may be a system in which a code segment presented in an intermediate language e.g. Microsoft IL Java ByteCode etc. is provided to a Just in Time JIT compiler or interpreter in an execution environment such as that provided by the .Net framework the Java runtime environment or other similar runtime type environments . The JIT compiler may be written so as to dynamically convert the communications from the 1st Code Segment to the 2nd Code Segment i.e. to conform them to a different interface as may be required by the 2nd Code Segment either the original or a different 2nd Code Segment . This is depicted in . As can be seen in this approach is similar to the Divorce scenario described above. It might be done e.g. where an installed base of applications are designed to communicate with an operating system in accordance with an Interface protocol but then the operating system is changed to use a different interface. The JIT Compiler could be used to conform the communications on the fly from the installed base applications to the new interface of the operating system. As depicted in this approach of dynamically rewriting the interface s may be applied to dynamically factor or otherwise alter the interface s as well.

It is also noted that the above described scenarios for achieving the same or similar result as an interface via alternative embodiments may also be combined in various ways serially and or in parallel or with other intervening code. Thus the alternative embodiments presented above are not mutually exclusive and may be mixed matched and combined to produce the same or equivalent scenarios to the generic scenarios presented in . It is also noted that as with most programming constructs there are other similar ways of achieving the same or similar functionality of an interface which may not be described herein but nonetheless are represented by the spirit and scope of the invention i.e. it is noted that it is at least partly the functionality represented by and the advantageous results enabled by an interface that underlie the value of an interface.

Desktop space is an area of a display that allows for the display of windows corresponding to application programs. The taskbar at the bottom indicates which windows are currently in use which may be visible or minimized. A taskbar is a specific implementation of an on screen window remote control used to list and enable manipulation of windows such as activating moving hiding and minimizing. Window may be represented by taskbar button . Window may be represented by taskbar button . Window may be represented by taskbar button . Window may be represented by taskbar button . Window may be represented by taskbar button . Window may be represented by taskbar button . As shown in this example all six of the windows are shown open. Although only six windows are shown it should be understood that more or fewer windows may be open. The taskbar button order may indicate the order in which the corresponding windows were first opened. For example window is the third window from the top of the Z order as shown by its corresponding taskbar button while window was the least recent window opened in comparison to the other five windows.

Each of windows and includes an indicium respectively corresponding to the application program using the window. Each window in is shown to include an indicium. For example windows and respectively include indicium . It should be understood by those skilled in the art that any particular window may or may not include a corresponding indicium.

For the windows and shown in it is difficult to easily determine the different windows that are open and where any particular window is in the Z order. In some orientations one or more windows may completely obscure an underlying window in the Z order. In such a case a user will not be able to see the underlying window. Further in some cases the taskbar area may be hidden when not in use. As such a user would not even be able to quickly see the taskbar buttons without activating the taskbar area.

To initiate x ray window browsing according to an illustrative aspect of the present invention the user inputs a command in the form of a keyboard shortcut a mouse action a voice input or the like. These inputs might include a shortcut sequence like Windows Tab or pushing the mouse pointer to a corner of the screen. In response to the command each of the windows in except one has their opacities changed to be substantially or wholly transparent. The resulting display screen is shown in where each of the windows and except window becomes nearly transparent. The window which is opaque becomes the window in focus. In the example when the x ray browsing function is initiated the window which was at the top of the Z order becomes in focus and remains opaque. It will be understood that responsive to the command to initiate browsing the window at the top of the Z order does not necessarily take focus. Other mechanisms can be used to decide which window should initially take focus. For example the default selection could instead be the second topmost the rearmost or the window in which the cursor or mouse pointer is located when the x ray browsing command is received. Alternatively a user by way of a dialog menu or other user interface could define this functionality to control which window should be in focus first and the actual order of navigation.

To browse to another of the windows currently transparent the user can issue another command by performing an action such as pressing the Tab key while continuing to hold the Windows key spinning the mouse wheel one click or providing another input. In this example shown in issuance of the command causes the bottommost window in the Z order to become opaque and in focus while the other windows including window are set to be substantially transparent. It will be appreciated that browsing to another window may be implemented in response to a further user input or it may occur automatically following a passage of time e.g. five seconds for example in much the same way a scan operation functions with respect to a radio. In both instances a browsing command is initiated one by a user and the other automatically.

In the illustrative implementation shown only one window is ever fully opaque and the user navigates through the open windows in a linear order. One illustrative order is Z order closest to farthest . However many other orders are possible like distance from an edge or corner of the screen alphabetical by title of the window alphabetical by application and title etc. A user interface may be provided in a configuration mode to allow the user to pre select the order in which windows would be navigated.

Continued browsing will cause other individual windows to be put in focus and have their opacities increased to be substantially opaque successively while the opacity of the remaining windows not in focus will be to be substantially transparent. In this implementation at any one time the window in focus has a substantially greater opacity than the windows not in focus. Upon completion of browsing for example in response to a command the Z order can change where the window in focus moves to the top of the Z order and the opacity of all the windows returns to the opacity shown in .

In certain illustrative implementations of browsing according to the present invention all open windows maintain their horizontal and vertical position and size as well as their position in the Z order while being browsed. While not required maintaining these parameters as described can minimize the impact of the browsing action on the user s mental model of their workspace. As such the user will more easily be able to remember the window size window position and the period in which a specific window was browsed relative to other windows to find the desired window more quickly.

While the example of the invention described with respect to discloses a system which uses all the open and visible windows one skilled in the art will appreciate that minimized or hidden windows could also be represented by thumbnails or full sized restored versions in the desktop space and thus could be browsed to by applying the x ray browsing method described. That is in response to a command all minimized and hidden windows could be included on the display screen as thumbnails or in restored versions.

Alternatively a subset of the open visible or hidden windows could be browsed through. In one implementation browsing could be set to occur based on all windows associated with a word processing application or all windows with other common characteristics. In these scenarios the windows on the desktop could be segmented into a particular group and the browsing would only be carried out among those windows in the particular group. The screen real estate could be used entirely for the browsing action or could be subdivided as needed.

In a further implementation of x ray browsing as shown in the titlebar of the windows out of focus may remain opaque to allow the user to easily identify other windows which can be navigated to. For example the titlebars and of windows and respectively are shown as being opaque in . In this implementation the content portion of the windows not in focus would still have their opacities reduced relative to the opacities of the content portion of the window in focus. Also the opacity of the title portion of the window in focus could also be set to be substantially transparent to allow a user to see more of the underlying windows. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the opacities of the windows or portions of windows may be manipulated as appropriate to aid a user in browsing through open windows. While the present invention does not require any specific window opacity to achieve the benefits of x ray browsing the opacity of the window in focus needs to be of a nature which delineates it from the windows out of focus. Stated differently the relative opacity between a window in focus and a window out of focus should be sufficient to allow a user to visually differentiate with relative ease which window is in focus and which is not.

It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that aspects of the invention described above may be applied to any view of a collection of objects which are typically identified by their visual attributes i.e. size shape position content . For example a collection of photographs in a folder container may be presented as piles or stacks grouped by a common attribute or explicitly by the user. Because these stacks also maintain a z order aspects of the invention could be used to browse the stack of photos to locate retrieve a specific photo without having to resort to opening or flattening the stack.

Most existing operating systems have functionality to control the opacities of windows and third party software exists that allows users to manually change the opacity of a single window. In another implementation of the present invention various aspects of the present invention may be performed by an application programming interface API . For example public APIs may interface with an operating system to allow an operating system to provide the various features of the present invention. In one aspect a software architecture for processing data representative of a first window in focus and a second window out of focus on a computer display may include a component configured to set the opacity of a first window and a second window wherein the opacity of the first window is set to be substantially opaque relative to the opacity of the second window and an application program interface to access the component. An API may receive a request to put one window in focus and other windows out of focus access the necessary function s to perform the operation and then send the results back to an operating system. The operating system may use the data provided from the API to perform the various features of the present invention.

In another implementation a programming interface operable with an operating system can perform the steps including intercepting an instruction to a destination module from the operating system to place one window in focus and other windows out of focus and providing to the destination module an instruction to set the opacity of the one window and the other windows wherein the instruction sets the opacity of the one window to be substantially opaque relative to the opacities of the other windows.

While illustrative systems and methods as described herein embodying various aspects of the present invention are shown it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to these embodiments. Modifications may be made by those skilled in the art particularly in light of the foregoing teachings. For example each of the elements of the aforementioned embodiments may be utilized alone or in combination or subcombination with elements of the other embodiments. It will also be appreciated and understood that modifications may be made without departing from the true spirit and scope of the present invention. The description is thus to be regarded as illustrative instead of restrictive on the present invention.
