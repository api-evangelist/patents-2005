title: Method, apparatus and article for evaluating card games, such as blackjack
abstract: A system reads an identifier from a hand of cards to identify the cards. For example, the system can read an identifier from a pair of cards forming the initial hand in blackjack, where the one card is face up and the other card is face down. The system determines the value of a hand of cards form the read identifiers. For example, the system can determine a value of an initial hand of two cards in blackjack, while only one card is face up. The system can inform a dealer of the value, or status based on value, of the hand. The system can determine whether cards forming a hand of cards are authenticate by validating the cards based on the read identifier. The system can determine if the cards forming the hand of cards are in an expected sequence based on a knowledge of the initial sequence of cards in a deck.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 756 044 filed Jan. 13 2004 now pending which is a division of U.S. Pat. No. 6 685 568 issued Feb. 3 2004.

Card games are a well known form of recreation and entertainment. Games are typically played with one or more decks of cards where each deck typically includes 52 cards. Each deck of cards will typically include four suits of cards including hearts diamonds clubs and spades each suit including fourteen cards having rank 2 10 Jack Queen King and Ace. Card games may or may not include wagering based on the game s outcome.

One popular card game is known as blackjack. In blackjack one or more players each compete against a dealer. The players attempt to collect a hand having a total value equal to or as close to twenty one without going over. The value of the hand is determined by the rank of the card. Thus cards having rank 2 10 have the value 2 10 respectively. Face cards i.e. Jack Queen King have the value 10 while Aces can have the value 1 or 10 at the player s discretion. An initial hand of two cards having the value of twenty one i.e. an Ace plus a ten or a face card is referred to as a natural 21 or blackjack and beats other hands with the value of twenty one. Suits have no bearing on the game of blackjack.

In blackjack the dealer will initially deal two cards to each of the players and the dealer. The dealer deals in two passes around the table starting with players at the dealer s far left i.e. first base and extending through players at the dealer s far right i.e. third base and finally to them self. The players cards are dealt face up in games where the cards are dealt from a shoe and face down in hand held games i.e. games dealt by hand . The rules of play for the dealer are strictly dictated leaving no decisions up to the dealer. Therefore there is not a problem with the dealer or any of the other players at the table seeing the cards in a player s hand.

The dealer turns over or is dealt one of the dealer s first two cards face up such that the value of the card is visible to the players at the table. This card is commonly referred to as the top card. The dealer leaves or is dealt the second card face down such that the value of the card is not visible to the players at the table. The face down card is commonly referred to as the hole card. In some variations of blackjack the dealer will immediately determine the value of the hole card while in other variations of the game the dealer waits until all players have played their hands before checking the value of the hole card.

The dealer then offers each player in succession from the dealer s left to right the opportunity to accept additional cards from the deck. Each player s hand is completed before the dealer offers the next player the opportunity to receive additional cards. Accepting cards is commonly referred to as hitting or taking a hit. At each player s turn the player may accept cards one at a time trying to build a hand with a value as close to twenty one as possible without going over twenty one. The player may decline further cards at anytime which is commonly referred to as standing. The player must terminate play if the value of the player s hand exceeds twenty one. A hand with a value exceeding twenty one is commonly referred to as a bust or busted. If the player busts or has a natural twenty one i.e. blackjack the dealer must complete the player s hand and place that player s cards into a discard holder. Before receiving a third card after the initial hands are dealt a player can split the player s initial hand. This is commonly referred to as splitting. The player uses one of the initial cards to form a new hand placing a wager for the new hand and retains the other of the initial cards as a part of the original hand.

After each player in turn has declined to accept further cards the dealer may accept further cards from the deck with goal of obtaining a hand having a value as close to twenty one as possible without exceeding twenty one. Casinos have rules based on the value of the dealer s hand that dictate when the dealer must take an additional card from the deck i.e. hit and when the player must decline further additional cards i.e. stand . For example many casinos require the dealer to stand if the dealer s hand has a value of seventeen or more. Some casinos permit the dealer to take an additional card if the value of the dealer s hand is a soft seventeen that is if the value of the dealer s hand is seventeen by counting an Ace held by the dealer as eleven.

If the dealer busts players who have not also busted win. If the dealer does not bust all remaining players and the dealer must display their hands to allow the dealer to compare each of the player s hands to the dealer s hand. Those players having a hand with a higher value than the dealer s hand and who have not exceed twenty one win. The winning players are paid based oh the size of their wager and the odds. Blackjack includes additional rules such as doubling down and insurance bets and other variations that are commonly known by those who play blackjack and will not be further described in the interest of brevity.

Blackjack is particularly popular in casinos and other gaming establishments. Players wager large sums of money while playing blackjack. Thus it is important to ensure that those playing the game are not cheating. It is also important to monitor the game in a relatively unobtrusive manner to allow casino customers to feel comfortable in their surroundings.

In one aspect a system reads an identifier from a hand of cards to identify the cards. For example the system can read an identifier from a pair of cards forming the initial hand in blackjack where one card of the pair is face up and the other card is face down.

In another aspect a system determines the value of a hand of cards. For example the system can determine a value of an initial hand of two cards in blackjack while only one card is face up. In another aspect the system can inform a dealer of the value or status based on value of the hand.

In a further aspect a system can determine whether cards forming a hand of cards are authentic by validating the cards based on an identifier read from each of the cards forming the hand. In yet a further aspect a system can determine if the cards forming a hand of cards are in an expected sequence based on a knowledge of the initial sequence of cards in a deck.

In the following description certain specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of various embodiments of the invention. However one skilled in the art will understand that the invention may be practiced without these details. In other instances well known structures associated with cameras optics computers computer networks data structures databases and networks such as the Internet have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the descriptions of the embodiments of the invention.

Unless the context requires otherwise throughout the specification and claims which follow the word comprise and variations thereof such as comprises and comprising are to be construed in an open inclusive sense that is as including but not limited to. 

The client computing systems each include a display screen cabinet keyboard and mouse . The mouse can have one or more user selectable buttons for interacting with a graphical user interface GUI displayed on the screen . The cabinet includes a slot for receiving computer readable media such as a CD ROM disk . Although the computer readable media is represented as a CD ROM disk the card game evaluation system can employ other computer readable media including but not limited to floppy disks tape flash memory system memory and hard drives. The CD ROM disk can hold software applications discussed in detail below.

The server computing system includes a cabinet having a slot for receiving computer readable media such as a CD ROM disk similar to the CD ROM disk . The server computing system can optionally include a display screen keyboard and or mouse as described above. The server computing system also includes a server database . The server database is shown as being external to the cabinet for ease of representation in the drawings although in many embodiments the server database can be located within the cabinet .

The card hand reader has a slot sized and dimensioned for receiving a hand of cards such as the dealer s initial hand which consists of the face up top card and the face down hole card . An indicator light is placed on the card hand reader such that it is visible to the dealer. As described in detail in commonly assigned U.S. patent application 60 259 658 filed Jan. 4 2001 and entitled Method Apparatus And Article for Verifying Card Games Such As Blackjack the card hand reader is capable of reading an identifier associated with each of the cards . The identifier can be encoded for example in a machine readable symbol such as a bar code or in a magnetic strip carried by the card . The identifier may take the form of a unique identifier such as a serial number that uniquely identifies each card in the deck of cards and or the rank and or suit of the cards . As illustrated the card hand reader can be directly connected to one of the client computing systems or can be coupled to a client computing system via the network .

The card deck reader can take a hand held form A for games dealt by hand or can take a card shoe form B for games dealt from a card shoe. The hand held card deck reader A includes a slot sized and dimensioned to receive one or more decks of playing cards . The dealer can insert the deck into the slot prior to beginning a game. The shoe card deck reader B contains one or more decks of playing cards and includes a slot sized and dimensioned to allow the dealer to remove one card at a time. The card deck reader A B is capable of reading a unique identifier such as a serial number identifying each card in the deck of cards and or the rank and suit of the cards in the deck of cards . A similar reader is described in commonly assigned patent applications Ser. No. 60 130 368 filed Apr. 21 1999 and Ser. No. 09 474 858 filed Dec. 30 1999 and entitled Method and Apparatus For Monitoring Casino Gaming. Thus the sequence of the cards in the deck is known to the card game evaluation system at the start of the game. As illustrated the card deck reader A B can be directly connected to one of the client computing systems or can be coupled to a client computing system via the network .

The discard shoe A B includes a slot for receiving cards collected by the dealer after the hands are completed. The discard shoe includes suitable electronics and or optics for identifying the cards placed in the slot for example by reading a unique identifier such as a serial number or the rank and suit of each card as described in detail below.

The network can take the form of any conventional network such as one or more local area networks LANs wide area networks WANs and or extranets intranets or the Internet.

The client computing systems can take any of a variety of forms such as a micro or personal computer a mini computer a workstation or a palm top or hand held computing appliance. The processor can take the form of any suitable microprocessor for example a PENTIUM II PENTIUM III PENTIUM IV POWER PC 603 or POWER PC 604 processor. The system memory can take the form of random access memory RAM or other dynamic storage that temporarily stores instructions and data for execution by the processor . The fixed persistent memory can take the form of a hard drive or other nonvolatile computer readable media. The media drive can take the form of a CD ROM reader a DVD reader an optical disk reader floppy disk reader or other similar device that reads instructions and or data from computer readable media.

While not shown in detail the server computing system can have a similar structure to the client computing systems as shown in . In practice the server computing system will typically take the form of a network server the details of which are commonly understood by those skilled in the art.

The computing systems are illustrative of the numerous computing systems suitable for use with the present invention. Other suitable configurations of computing systems will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Other configurations can include additional subsystems or fewer subsystems as is suitable for the particular application. For example a suitable computing system can include more than one processor i.e. a multiprocessor system and or a cache memory. The arrows are illustrative of any interconnection scheme serving to link the subsystems. Other suitable interconnection schemes will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art. For example a local bus could be utilized to connect the processor to the system memory and the display adapter .

The machine readable symbol can be printed on an end of a face of the cards . The machine readable symbol is preferably printed such that it is not visually perceptible to humans. For example the machine readable symbol can be printed in an ink that is visible only under a particular wavelength of light such as ultraviolet. Alternatively the machine readable symbol can be incorporated into the design on the face of the card such that the symbol blends in with the design. In a further alternative the machine readable symbol can be printed in a magnetic ink. The identifier is preferably printed on a back face i.e. face without rank or suit of the cards . The dealer can pick up the initial hand with the hole card on top of the top card such that the front faces i.e. faces bearing the card s rank and suit are adjacent one another. Thus only the back faces of the cards are visible when the dealer places the dealer s hand into the card hand reader . This reduces the chance of one of the players seeing the rank of the dealer s hole card.

A frame of the card hand reader includes a card guide having a slot sized and dimensioned for receiving the hand of cards . The card guide ensures that the cards in the initial hand are properly positioned with respect to a set of optical components described below.

An optical switch detects the presence of the cards when the cards are properly positioned to be imaged. The optical switch can take the form of a light source such as a light emitting diode LED and a light sensor opposed to the light source across the slot in the card guide . The insertion of the cards between the light source and light sensor interrupts the reception of light by the light sensor which acts as the switch. The hand card reader can alternatively employ other switching devices such as mechanical switches for detecting when the cards are properly positioned for imaging.

The optics include a prism assembly an optical lens assembly and an imager aligned along an optical axis. The optical lens assembly can include one or more optical lenses. A 9.9 FL lens assembly available from Sunex Inc. Carlsbad Calif. part number DSL900C can serve as a suitable optical lens assembly . The imager includes photo sensitive elements such as charged coupled devices CCDs and suitable electronics for producing a digital representation of a captured image. A CMOS color sensor such as the CMOS color sensor available from Photobit Corporation Pasadena Calif. part number PB300 can serve as a suitable imager . The card hand reader can include additional optical components such as reflectors defractors splitters polarizers filters and lenses where such would be suitable to the particular application. The optical axis is defined by the optical properties and position of the optical components and is not necessarily a straight path. Many of the components can be housed in an arm formed from a pair of molded plastic halves.

The optical path of the image of the top card is illustrated by broken line arrow while the optical path of the image of the bottom card is illustrated by the broken line arrow . In each case the image reflects from the hypotenuse of the respective prism portion onto the mirror surface of the reflector which directs the image toward the optical lens assembly and imager . The geometry of the optical system ensures that the image from each of the cards is properly focused on the imager via the top and bottom prism portions .

The base is mounted to a bottom that allows the frame to rotate about an axis with respect to the arm . Each of the base printed circuit board and bottom as well as the group of illumination sources has a central opening for providing an unobstructed optical path between the prism portions and the imager . The illumination sources produce light suitable to the particular embodiment. For example the card hand reader employs illumination sources that produce predominately UV where the machine readable symbols are only visible under UV illumination.

The card hand reader is coupled to the network or host computer by way of a connector such as a FIREWIRE connector or Universal Serial Bus USB connector. For example a FIREWIRE connector available from Molex Electronics Ltd. of Canada part number 52462 0611 can serve as a suitable connector . The connector can deliver the digital representation of the captured image to the appropriate client computing system for image processing and card validation.

The machine readable symbol can be printed on an end of a face of the cards shown in . The machine readable symbol is preferably printed such that it is not visually perceptible to humans. For example the machine readable symbol can be printed in an ink that is visible only under a particular wavelength of light such as ultraviolet. Alternatively the machine readable symbol can be incorporated into the design on the face of the card such that the symbol blends in with the design. In a further alternative the machine readable symbol can be printed in a magnetic ink. The identifier is preferably printed on a front face i.e. face with rank and suit indicia of the cards .

A card guide holds the cards and ensures that the cards are properly positioned with respect to a set of reading components such as electronics and optical components described below. The card guide includes a card support surface . The card support surface is sloped with respect to a base of the discard shoe to hold the cards in the discard shoe such that the cards are slightly shifted or staggered with respect to adjacent cards as shown in when the discard shoe is on the horizontal playing surface of the gaming table not shown . A bottom end wall supports the cards on the sloped card support surface and forms an acute angle therewith. An angle of approximately 45 degrees is suitable. A top end wall is transparent or has a window formed therein to expose the ends of the faces of the cards in the card guide . Side walls help ensure the cards are properly aligned to form a stack within the card guide .

The reading electronics and optics can include an optical lens assembly a reflector and an imager aligned along an optical path illustrated by broken line arrow . The optical lens assembly can include one or more optical lenses and filters. For example a 9.9 FL lens assembly available from Sunex Inc. Carlsbad Calif. part number DSL900 can serve as a suitable optical lens. Also for example the optical lens assembly can include a narrow band pass filter that passes light having a wavelength of approximately 450 nanometers while stopping other light such as light coming directly from an illumination source . A suitable filter is available from Edmond Scientific of Barrington N.J. as part number 00151 11859.

The imager includes photo sensitive elements such as charged coupled devices CCDs and suitable electronics for producing a digital representation of a captured image. A CMOS color sensor such as the CMOS color sensor available from Photobit Corporation Pasadena Calif. part number PB300 can serve as a suitable imager .

The reflector can be positioned at an angle such as a 45 degree angle to the top end wall and the imager to pass an image of the ends of the cards to the imager . The discard card reader can include additional optical components such as reflectors defractors splitters polarizers filters and lenses where such would be suitable to the particular application. For example the discard card reader can include an aperture between the reflector and the top end wall which can improve the field of depth of the imager . The optical path is defined by the optical properties and position of the optical components and thus does not necessarily have to be a straight line. Many of the components can be housed in an arm formed from a pair of molded plastic halves.

The discard card reader includes an illumination system having one or more illumination sources that provide low intensity illumination for the cards . The illumination sources can take the form of one or more lamps. The illumination sources produce light suitable to the particular embodiment. For example the discard card reader can employ illumination sources that produce predominately UV light where the machine readable symbols are only visible under UV illumination. Suitable lamps can include ultraviolet UV lamps available from JKL Components Corporation of Pacoima Calif. as part number BF350 UV1 having a diameter of 3 millimeters and a length of 50 millimeters. The illumination sources are located proximate the top end wall of the card guide . The illumination sources receive power from a high voltage power inverter via a printed circuit board that receives power from a 5V power source . A suitable high voltage power inverter is available from JKL Components Corporation as part number BXA 501A.

The discard card reader is coupled to the network or host computer by way of a connector such as a FIREWIRE connector or Universal Serial Bus USB connector. For example a FIREWIRE connector available from Molex Electronics Ltd. of Canada part number 52462 0611 can serve as a suitable connector . The connector can deliver the digital representation of the captured image to the appropriate client computing system for image processing and card validation.

The embodiment shown in is particularly suited for reading up to two decks of cards the imager typically having a field of view encompassing up to two decks. The embodiment of has a similar field of view and moves field of view relative to the cards to incrementally read all of the cards in the discard shoe .

The discard card reader employs an actuator such as a jack screw or a hydraulic actuator to incrementally move the cards past the field of view of the imager . The actuator moves the card support surface to incrementally pass the cards by the aperture . The card support surface is slidably mounted with respect to the bottom end wall top end wall and side walls . The card support surface can include a number of tabs which fit in grooves formed in the side walls to guide the card support surface as it advances upward and downward in the card guide . The tops and bottoms of the grooves can serve as stops to limit the travel of the card support surface . The discard card reader can of course employ other guide mechanisms or may function without such a mechanism. While the illustrated embodiment shows the actuator moving the cards other embodiments can move the reflector imager and or one or more of these components to sweep the field of view of the imager across all of the cards in the card guide .

The hydraulic actuator includes a cylinder and piston which is moved relative to the cylinder by controlling the pressure within the cylinder via a reservoir valve and conduit . The discard card reader can of course employ other types of actuators The valve is operated by a solenoid that is controlled via a processor such as a microprocessor mounted on the circuit board .

The discard card reader includes one or more position sensors that detect the position of the card support surface the piston or the cards to determine the height of cards in the card guide . This allows the microprocessor to activate the solenoid to adjust the level of the card support surface so that the cards are properly positioned with respect to the aperture to be imaged. The position sensors can take the form of optical switches mechanical switches or magnetic switches. For example an optical switch can take the form of a light source such as a light emitting diode LED and a light sensor opposed to the light source across the card guide . The insertion of the cards between the light source and light sensor interrupts the reception of light by the light sensor that acts as the switch. Also for example a conductor mounted on or forming a part of the card support surface can contact one of a number of conductors on the side walls to close a circuit providing an indication of the position of the card support surface and hence the position of the cards . Similarly a magnet mounted on the card support surface or piston can pass one of a number of magnetic sensors such as a reed switch to provide position information to the microprocessor .

The discard card reader incrementally reads groups of cards. The microprocessor can be programmed to advanced the cards in set increments for example inch increments past the aperture . The microprocessor employs the position of the cards as a trigger for advancing the cards. For example a signal from a single position sensor positioned above the aperture can indicate that there are cards in the card guide that have not been read. The microprocessor advances the cards by activating the solenoid to open and close the value to the reservoir thereby controlling the flow of a fluid such as air into the cylinder . The discard card reader can employ other methods of positioning the cards for example turning a jack screw coupled to the card support surface .

As shown in the system memory of the client computing system and server computing system contain instructions and data for execution by the respective processors for implementing the illustrated embodiments. For example the system memory includes an operating system OS to provide instructions and data for operating the respective computing systems . In the case of the client computing systems the OS 95 can take the form of conventional operating systems such as WINDOWS 95 WINDOWS 98 WINDOWS NT 4.0 and or WINDOWS 2000 available from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. In the case of the server computing system the OS 96 can take the form of conventional server operating systems such as WINDOWS NT 4.0 Server and or WINDOWS 2000 Server also available from Microsoft Corporation. The OS 95 96 can include application programming interfaces APIs not shown for interfacing with the various subsystems and peripheral components of the computing systems as is conventional in the art. For example the OS 95 96 can include APIs for interfacing with a display subsystem keyboard sound subsystem and communications or network subsystem .

The system memory of the client and server computing systems can also include additional communications or networking software not shown for wired and or wireless communications on networks such as local area networks LANs wide area networks WANs or the Internet. For example the client computing system can include a Web client or browser for communicating across the World Wide Web portion of the Internet using standard protocol e.g. Transportation Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP User Datagram Protocol UDP . A number of Web browsers are commercially available such as NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR from America Online and INTERNET EXPLORER available from Microsoft of Redmond Wash. The server computing system can include a Web server such as any of the many commercially available Web server applications.

The system memory of the client computing system includes instructions and or data in the form of a decoding application for resolving the digital image into machine readable symbols and converting the machine readable symbols into their respective identifiers and or ranks and suits. Software for resolving digital images into machine readable symbols and converting the machine readable symbols into identifiers is commonly known in the automatic data collection ADC arts. The system can additional or alternatively include other software for reading and converting other types of identifiers such a magnetic strips.

The system memory of the client computing system also includes instructions and or data in the form of an evaluation application for determining the value and or status of the hand e.g. blackjack or not . The evaluation application also can authenticate the cards in the hand i.e. determine that the cards belong to the deck being played and validate the sequence of the cards comprising the hand with respect to a known sequence of cards for the deck i.e. no cards missing or inserted .

The method starts at step for example in response to the insertion of a deck of cards into the deck reader. In step the card game evaluation system determines the original sequence of cards in the deck. In step the card game evaluation system determines the identity of the cards in the dealer s initial hand. In step the card game evaluation system determines the number of active player positions i.e. hands being played . In step the card game evaluation system determines the identity of the cards in the initial hand for each of the active positions. In step the card game evaluation system determines the identity of the hit cards for the dealer. In step the card game evaluation system determines the value of the dealer s complete hand. In step the card game evaluation system determines the identity of the hit cards for each active position. In step the card game evaluation system determines the value of the completed hands for each active position. It is noted that step can follow step and or step . In step the card game evaluation system determines the outcome of the game for each active position. In step the card game evaluation system verifies the dealer s completed hand against the original deck sequence. In step the card game evaluation system verifies the completed hand against the original deck sequence for each of the active positions. It is noted that steps and or step can follow steps and or step . In step the card game evaluation system notifies the dealer and or other casino personnel of the outcome of the games for each of the active positions and of the outcome of the verification if any. The method terminates at step .

In step the card deck reader A B reads identifiers from each of the cards composing the deck of cards. A suitable deck reader is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 474 858 filed Dec. 30 1999 entitled Method and Apparatus For Monitoring Casino Gaming. In step the card game evaluation system determines the initial sequence of the cards in the deck of cards based on the identifiers read by the card deck reader A B.

In step the dealer deals a first card to each player. As explained above the dealer may deal by hand or may deal from a card shoe. The dealer deals to each player starting from the dealer s left i.e. first base to the dealer s right i.e. third base . In step the dealer deals herself a top card. In step the dealer deals a second card to each player again from first base to third base. In step the dealer deals herself a hole card.

In step the dealer places the dealer s initial hand i.e. top card and hole card into the card hand reader for reading. In step the card hand reader reads the dealer s initial hand as explained in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 60 130 368. In step the card game evaluation system determines the identity of cards in the dealer s initial hand. As explained above the card game evaluation system can rely on a machine readable symbol such as a bar code or magnetic strip encoding a serial number of the suit and rank of the card read by the card hand reader .

In step the card game evaluation system compares the dealer s initial hand to the card sequence in the deck.

In step the card game evaluation system determines the number of cards between the top and hole cards. The card game evaluation system determines the number of active positions in step from the number of cards between the top and hole cards. In step the card game evaluation system can determine the active positions at the gaming table for example by detecting the location of cards and or chips as described in commonly assigned patent application.

In step the card game evaluation system determines the rank and suit for cards i.e. players initial hands at each of the active positions based on the knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck and the number of active positions.

In step the dealer selects a first player. The first player is the player at the first base position. In step the dealer determines whether the player s hand is complete. The player s hand will only be complete if the player has a total value of twenty one or a blackjack i.e. initial hand with value of twenty one .

If the player s hand is complete i.e. blackjack the dealer may immediately pay the player in step or may wait to perform the step until all hands have been played. The dealer then places the player s hand into the discard shoe in step .

If the player s hand is not complete the dealer offers the player an additional card in step . In step the dealer determines whether the player stands. If the player does not stand the dealer deals another card to the player in step and returns to step to repeat the process for the player. If the player stands the dealer determines whether there are additional players in step . If there are additional players the dealer selects the next player in step and repeats the process for the next player. This repeats until the dealer determines that there are no more additional players.

If the dealer s hand is complete control passes to step . If the dealer s hand is not complete the dealer determines whether the dealer stands in step . The house rules typically determine whether the dealer stands or takes another card. For example the rule may require the dealer to stand if the value of the dealer s is 17 or more. Under some rules the dealer may take another card if the value of the dealer s hand is a soft i.e. Ace counted as eleven . If the dealer does not stand the dealer takes an additional card in step and returns to step repeating the process until the dealer s hand is complete or the dealer stands. If the dealer stands control passes to step .

In step the dealer compares the dealer s hand to the players hands starting with the player on the dealer s far right i.e. third base . In step the dealer determines whether the player wins. If the player wins the dealer pays the player in step . If the player does not win the dealer collects the player s wager in step . In step the dealer takes the player s hand and places the hand in the discard shoe. In step the dealer determines if there are more players. If there are more players the dealer selects the next player in step and returns to step . The dealer selects players from the dealer s right to left until the cards from the last player have been collected and placed in the discard shoe. The method terminates in step and a new round of blackjack can be played.

In step the dealer positions the cards in the discard shoe . In step the discard card reader reads the identifiers from the cards in the discard shoe . The discard card reader may employ an incremental process successively adjusting the field of view of the discard card reader to read the identifiers from successive sets of discarded cards.

In step the card game evaluation system identifies the location of the initial hands in the read sequence of discarded cards. The card game evaluation system knows the identity of the cards composing the initial hands from previously determining the initial hands based on a knowledge of the original sequence of the deck of cards and a knowledge of the dealer s initial hand as explained above .

In step the card game evaluation system determines the number of active hands. For example the number of cards between the dealer s initial hand and the first card in the first successive player s initial hand. The card game evaluation system may employ the previously determined number of active hands if splits are not permitted or have not occurred. In step the card game evaluation system determines the dealer s hit cards. In step the card game evaluation system determines the value of the dealer s hand based on the value of the cards in the dealer s initial hand and the value of the dealer s hit cards.

In step the card game evaluation system determines whether a split hand has occurred. The method branches based on the determination.

If a split hand has occurred the method follows a first branch . In step the card game evaluation system determines the hit cards for a player s first hand i.e. cards between first initial card and next successive initial hand . The card game evaluation system can employ its knowledge of the identity and sequence of cards collected from the dealer and players which comes from reading the identifiers from each of the cards by the discard card reader . The hit cards are typically the cards preceding the cards in the subject player s or dealer s initial hand that are not part of another player s or dealer s initial hand which is most clearly illustrated in below. In step the card game evaluation system determines the value of the player s hand. In step the card game evaluation system compares the value of the dealer s and player s hands. In step the card game evaluation system determines whether the player wins and records the outcome in step . In step the card game evaluation system determines whether there are additional player s hands to analyze. If there are additional player s hands to analyze the card game evaluation system determines the hit cards for the player s additional hand in step and returns to step .

If a split hand has not occurred the method follows a second branch . In step the card game evaluation system determines the hit cards for a player s hand i.e. cards between successive initial hands . In step the card game evaluation system then determines the value of the player s hand. In step the card game evaluation system compares the value of the dealer s and player s hands. In step the card game evaluation system determines whether the player wins and records the outcome in step .

In step the card game evaluation system determines whether there are hands to analyze for additional players. If there are additional players the card game evaluation system selects the next player s hand in step and returns control to step . If there are no additional players the method terminates at step .

The card game evaluation system can determine the initial hands for each of the players based on a knowledge of the initial sequence of cards in the deck and the identity of cards in the dealer s initial hand . The card game evaluation system determines the number of active players from the number of cards appearing between the dealer s top card and hole card in the sequence of cards . In this case there are three cards between the Ace of spades and the eight of hearts i.e. the eight of clubs ten of spades and seven of spades and thus three active players.

Knowing that there are three active players in addition to the dealer the card game evaluation system can map the original sequence of cards to each of the players. From the first base to the third base position each of the three players received a first card i.e. two of hearts nine of spades and seven of clubs respectively before the dealer s top card i.e. Ace of spades . From the first base to the third base position each of the three players received a second card i.e. eight of clubs ten of spades and seven of spades respectively before the dealer s hole card i.e. eight of hearts . Thus for players i from 1 through n where i is the player position from the dealer s left to right and n is the total number of players the player s i initial hand is composed of a first card corresponding to the i card in the sequence of the deck and a second card corresponding the n 1 i card in the sequence of the deck. The initial hand of the dealer is composed of a first card corresponding to the n 1 position in the sequence of the deck and a second card corresponding to the 2n 2 position. The initial hands of the players and dealer in this example are shown in table 1 below.

The second player s initial hand i.e. nine of spades ten of clubs immediately follows the dealer s initial hand i.e. Ace of spades eight of hearts . Thus since there are no intervening cards it is clear that the second player did not have any hit cards. One card i.e. queen of hearts immediately precedes the first player s initial hand i.e. two of hearts eight of clubs and follows the second player s hand. Thus the first player had one hit card a queen having a value equal to 10. The third player has two cards immediately preceding the third player s initial hand i.e. seven of clubs seven of spades and following the second player s hand. Thus the third player received two hit cards a ten of diamonds followed by an Ace of clubs. The hit cards for a hand are found in a successive number of locations in the deck starting at a position given by the formula 2n 2 the total number of hit cards taken by all previous positions where n corresponds to the total number of player hands. This is dictated by the way blackjack is played successively dealing two cards around the table to form the initial hands including the dealer i.e. 2n 2 . Then each player is given an opportunity to take cards until the player s hand is complete i.e. total number of hit cards taken by all previous positions .

The card game evaluation system can automatically determine the value of the player s and dealer s hands and can determine the outcome of the games between the various players and the dealer. The outcome of the games in this example are shown in table 2 below.

The dealer has an Ace and an eight for a total value of nineteen. The first player has a two an eight and a queen for a total value twenty which beats the dealer s nineteen. The second player has a nine and ten for a total value of nineteen which ties the dealer s total of nineteen. The third player has a pair of sevens an Ace valued as one and a ten for a total value of twenty five. Twenty five exceeds twenty one the so third player busted on the final card i.e. ten of diamonds .

The example is only slightly more complicated when one or more split hands occur but the card game evaluation system can employ the same general process to validate the game.

In block the dealer deals the initial hand i.e. two cards to each of the players and to the dealer as generally described in the Background section. In block the dealer places the dealer s own cards e.g. initial hand into the slot in the card hand reader A B. The back faces of the cards each face a respective one of the prism portions .

In block the insertion of the cards trigger the optical switch when the cards are properly positioned within the card hand reader to be imaged. In block the optical switch activates the illumination sources . The optical switch can rapidly turn the illumination sources ON and OFF causing the imager to capture a momentary image of the machine readable symbols on the cards . Alternatively the illumination sources may remain in the ON state and the optical switch can activate the imager to capture the desired image.

In block the imager captures a digitized image of the respective machine readable symbol on each of the cards . In block the card hand reader transmits the digitized image to the client computing system either directly or over the network .

In block the client computing system resolves the digitized image into machine readable symbols. In block the client computing system converts the machine readable symbols into respective serial numbers and or rank. Since the method is only directed to determining the value of the dealer s hand the card s suits do not need to be determined.

In block the client computing system determines the value of the dealer s initial hand . The value can be determined based on the serial number that uniquely identifies each card for example by way of a lookup table or database search of data in the database or other database not shown associated with one of the client computing systems . For example the serial numbers for each deck can be maintained in a central database associated with the server computing system or with the client computing system . Alternatively the value of the cards can be directly encoded into the machine readable symbols carried by each card. The client computing system can total the values of the two cards to determine the value of the dealer s initial hand . Knowledge of the value of the dealer s initial hand can effect the play of the game. For example the dealer may be able to immediately pay players having blackjack if it is known that the dealer s hand is not also a blackjack. The dealer may also be able to offer the player s the opportunity to surrender.

In block the client computing system notifies the dealer of the value of the dealer s initial hand and or status of the dealer s initial hand such a blackjack or not blackjack. The notification can come via an indicator at the gaming table not shown for example a digital display such as an LCD touch screen or a light positioned on the card hand reader or elsewhere on the gaming table. The visual display or light is placed such that it is visible to the dealer but not visible to the players.

In block the dealer deals the initial hand i.e. two cards to each of the players and to the dealer as generally described in the Background section. In block the dealer places the dealer s own cards into the slot in the card hand reader such that an identifier on each of the cards is facing a respective one of the prism portions .

In block the insertion of the cards trigger the optical switch when the cards are properly positioned with the card hand reader to be imaged. In block the optical switch activates the illumination sources . As discussed above the optical switch operates the illumination sources and or the imager to capture the desired image of the identifiers on the cards .

In block the imager captures a digitized image of the respective machine readable symbol on each of the cards . In block the card hand reader transmits the digitized image to the client computing system either directly or over the network .

In block the client computing system resolves the digitized image into machine readable symbols. In block the client computing system converts the machine readable symbols into respective serial numbers and or ranks and suits. Since the method is directed to uniquely identifying the cards with respect to the entire deck and not just the value of the dealer s hand the rank and suit would need to be determined if the client computing system was not relying on the serial number.

In block the client computing system compares the serial number of the cards in the dealer s initial hand with the known serial number of cards in the deck . If the serial number of the cards in the dealer s initial hand do not match the serial number of cards in the deck the client computing system notifies the dealer and or a manager e.g. pit boss of the discrepancy in block and may even terminate the game. The notification can come via an indicator at the gaming table for example a digital display or a light . The visual display or light is placed such that it is visible to the dealer but not visible to the players. If the serial number of the cards in the dealer s initial hand does match the serial number of cards in the deck the client computing system passes control to block .

In block the client computing system compares the identity of the cards in the dealer s hand with the expected sequence of cards in the deck . In a simple scenario this takes the form of comparing the order of the top and bottom cards with the order in the deck to ensure that the cards were dealt in the correct order. In more complicated analysis a knowledge of the number of players and or hands dealt and the initial deck sequence allows the client computing system to ensure that the dealer s hand is composed of the correct cards.

If the identity of the cards in the dealer s hand does not correspond with the expected sequence of cards in the deck the client computing device notifies the dealer and or a manager e.g. pit boss of the discrepancy in block and may even terminate the game. The notification can again come via an indicator at the gaming table for example a digital display or a light . If the identity of the cards in the dealer s hand does correspond with the expected sequence of cards in the deck the client computing device can notify the dealer and or manager in block allowing the game to continue.
