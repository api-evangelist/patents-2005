title: Two-stage implementation for phonetic recognition using a bi-directional target-filtering model of speech coarticulation and reduction
abstract: A structured generative model of a speech coarticulation and reduction is described with a novel two-stage implementation. At the first stage, the dynamics of formants or vocal tract resonance (VTR) are generated using prior information of resonance targets in the phone sequence. Bi-directional temporal filtering with finite impulse response (FIR) is applied to the segmental target sequence as the FIR filter's input. At the second stage the dynamics of speech cepstra are predicted analytically based on the FIR filtered VTR targets. The combined system of these two stages thus generates correlated and causally related VTR and cepstral dynamics where phonetic reduction is represented explicitly in the hidden resonance space and implicitly in the observed cepstral space. The combined system also gives the acoustic observation probability given a phone sequence. Using this probability, different phone sequences can be compared and ranked in terms of their respective probability values. This then permits the use of the model for phonetic recognition.

The present application is based on and claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60 625 222 filed Nov. 5 2004 the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Reference is made to co pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 071 904 filed Mar. 1 2005 entitled ACOUSTIC MODELS WITH STRUCTURED HIDDEN DYNAMICS WITH INTEGRATION OVER MANY POSSIBLE HIDDEN TRAJECTORIES the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to models of speech. In particular the present invention relates to vocal tract resonance VTR models of structured speech and integrating the VTR models into cepstra prediction.

Human speech contains spectral prominences or VTRs. These VTRs carry a significant amount of the information contained in human speech.

In the past attempts have been made to model the VTRs associated with particular phonetic units such as phonemes using discrete state models such as a Hidden Markov Model. Such models have been less than ideal however because they do not perform well when the speaking rate increases or the articulation effort of the speaker decreases.

Research into the behavior of VTRs during speech indicates that one possible reason for the difficulty of conventional Hidden Markov Model based systems in handling fluent speech is that during fluent speech the static VTR values and hence the static acoustic information for different classes of phonetic units become very similar as the speaking rate increases or the articulation effort decreases.

Although this phenomenon known as reduction has been observed in human speech an adequate and quantitative model for predicting such behavior in VTR tracts has not been developed. As such a model is needed that predicts the observed dynamic patterns of the VTRs based on the interaction between phonetic context speaking rate and speaking style.

A structured generative model of a speech coarticulation and reduction is described with a novel two stage implementation. At the first stage the dynamics of formants or vocal tract resonance VTR are generated using prior information of resonance targets in the phone sequence. Bi directional temporal filtering with finite impulse response FIR is applied to the segmental target sequence as the FIR filter s input. At the second stage the dynamics of speech cepstra are predicted analytically based on the FIR filtered VTR targets. The combined system of these two stages thus generates correlated and causally related VTR and cepstral dynamics where phonetic reduction is represented explicitly in the hidden resonance space and implicitly in the observed cepstral space. The combined system also gives the acoustic observation probability given a phone sequence. Using this probability different phone sequences can be compared and ranked in terms of their respective probability values. This then permits the use of the model for phonetic recognition.

In the past the failure of Hidden Markov Models to perform well on speech signals with high speaking rates or with low speaking effort has often been attributed to a lack of training data for these types of speech. The present inventors however have discovered that it is likely that even with more training data for these types of speech Hidden Markov Models will still not be able to recognize speech with the desired amount of accuracy. The reason for this is that at high speaking rates the static VTR patterns and hence the static acoustic information e.g. cepstra for different vowel sounds begin to converge if only isolated or static portions of the speech signal are examined when making a recognition decision.

This convergence of the VTR values for different vowel sounds is referred to as static confusion. provides a diagram showing that as the speaking rate increases VTRs for two different vowel sounds begin to converge. In particular in the speaking rate is shown on horizontal axis and the frequency of the first and second VTRs is shown on vertical axis . In speaking rate increases from left to right and frequency increases from the bottom to the top. The value of the first VTR and the second VTR for the vowel sound a are shown by lines and respectively. The values of the first and second VTR for the vowel sound e are shown by lines and respectively.

As can be seen in the first and second VTRs for the vowel sounds a and e are much more separated at lower speaking rates than at higher speaking rates. Because of this at higher speaking rates it is more difficult for the speech recognition system to distinguish between the a sound and the e sound.

The present invention provides a model for VTRs which accurately predicts the static confusion represented by the data of . This model is a result of an interaction between phonetic context speaking rate duration and spectral rate of changes related to the speaking style.

Under the model a sequence of VTR targets modeled as step functions are passed through a finite impulse response FIR filter to produce a smooth continuous VTR pattern.

In equation 1 k 0 represents a current time point k less than zero represents past time points and k greater than zero represents future time points.

Thus in the impulse response of Equation 1 it is assumed for simplicity that the impulse response is symmetric such that the extent of coarticulation in the forward direction is equal to the extent of coarticulation in the backward direction. In other words the impulse response is symmetric with respect to past time points and future time points. In other embodiments the impulse response is not symmetrical. In particular for languages other than English it is sometimes beneficial to have a nonsymmetrical impulse response for the FIR filter.

In Equation 1 C is a normalization constraint that is used to ensure that the sum of the filter weights adds up to one. This is essential for the model to produce target undershoot instead of overshoot. To compute C it is first assumed that the stiffness parameter stays approximately constant across the temporal span of the finite impulse response such that Equation 2

Under the model of the present invention the target for the VTRs is modeled as a sequence of step wise functions with variable durations and heights which can be defined as 

The boundaries for the segments must be known in order to generate the target sequence. This information can be determined using a recognizer s forced alignment results or can be learned automatically using algorithms such as those described in J. Ma and L. Deng Efficient Decoding Strategies for Conversational Speech Recognition Using a Constrained Non Linear State Space Model for Vocal Tract Resonance Dynamics IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing Volume 11 203 pages 590 602.

Given the FIR filter and the target sequence the VTR trajectories can be determined by convolving the filter response with the target sequence. This produces a VTR trajectory of 

Note that a separate computation of Equation 6 is performed for each VTR frequency resulting in separate VTR trajectories.

The parameters of the filter as well as the duration of the targets for each phone can be modified to produce many kinds of target undershooting effects in a contextually assimilated manner.

Because of the shorter duration of each segment the predicted VTR trajectories do not come as close to the target values in as they did in . Thus as the duration of a speech segment shortens there is an increase in the reduction of the VTR trajectories predicted by the present model. This agrees well with the observed reductions in VTR trajectories as speech segments shorten.

The predicted VTR trajectories under the present invention also predict the static confusion between phonemes that is found in the observation data of . In particular as shown in the FIR filter model of the present invention predicts that as speaking rates increase the values of the first and second VTRs for two different phonetic units will begin to approach each other. As in in speaking rate is shown along horizontal axis and VTR frequency values are shown along vertical axis .

In lines and show the values predicted by the model of the present invention for the first and second VTRs respectively of the phonetic unit e as a function of speaking rate. Lines and show the values predicted by the model for the first and second VTRs respectively of the phonetic unit a .

As shown by the predicted values for the first and second VTRs of phonetic units e and a converge towards each other as the speaking rate increases. Thus the FIR filter model of the present invention generates VTR trajectories that agree well with the observed data and that suggest that static confusion between phonetic units is caused by convergence of the VTR values as speaking rates increase.

The VTR trajectory model of the present invention may be used in a speech synthesis system such as speech synthesizer of . In a text is provided to a parser and a semantic analysis component . Parser parses the text into phonetic units that are provided to a VTR target selection unit and an excitation control . Semantic analysis component identifies semantic features of text and provides these features to a prosody calculator . Prosody calculator identifies the duration pitch and loudness of different portions of text based on the semantic identifiers provided by semantic analysis . Typically the result of prosody calculator is a set of prosody marks that are provided to excitation control and VTR target selection .

Using the prosody marks which indicate the duration of different sounds and the identities of the phonetic units provided by parser VTR target selection generates a target sequence using a set of predefined targets . Typically there is a separate set of targets for each phonetic unit that can be produced by parser where each set targets includes a separate target for each of four VTRs.

The output of VTR target selection is a sequence of targets similar to target sequence of which is provided to a finite impulse response filter . The impulse response of finite impulse response filter is defined according to Equation 1 above. Under some embodiments the response is dependent on the particular phonetic units identified by parser . In such cases the response of the filter is set by an FIR parameter selection unit which selects the parameters from a set of stored finite impulse response parameters based on the phonetic units identified by parser .

The output of FIR filter is a set of VTR trajectories which in one embodiment includes trajectories for four separate VTRs. These VTR trajectories are provided to a second order filter .

Excitation control uses the phonetic units from parser and the prosody marks from prosody calculator to generate an excitation signal which in one embodiment is formed by concatenating excitation samples from a set of excitation samples . The excitation signal produced by excitation control is passed through second order filter which filters the excitation signal based on the VTR trajectories identified by FIR filter . This results in synthesized speech .

As noted earlier the model for VTRs described by Equations 4 through 6 relatively accurately predicts the static confusion represented by the data of for example and therefore is useful in speech synthesis systems such as the system shown in . However the above model for VTRs hereinafter referred to as the first model does not take into account randomness or variability in the VTR targets. Thus when used in speech recognition systems for example it is best suited to help recognize speech from a fixed speaker.

A second model for VTR dynamics described below by Equations 7 through 10 removes the above noted assumption and instead treats VTR targets as random variables. The development of the second model begins with the characterization of the VTR randomness in terms of its statistical distribution. For simplification equations included below utilize Gaussian distributions to characterize VTR randomness. However any suitable distribution may be utilized to characterize randomness in the VTR without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. In the second model for each gender not denoted here for simplicity and for each segment s a separate Gaussian distribution for the target is assumed and defined as Equation 7 where is a mean of the target T and is a variance of the target T.

Given a sampled target sequence T in a form defined by Equation 7 and the FIR filter the corresponding random VTR trajectory z k can be determined in a form similar to that described by Equation 5 by convolving the FIR filter response with the target sequence. Hence a Gaussian distribution gender specific for VTR trajectory z k is 

In the second model individual distributions of the VTR trajectory are sequentially concatenated together in a manner similar to that described above in connection with Equation 6 of the first model.

As mentioned above the parameters of the filter as well as the duration of the targets for each phone can be modified to produce many kinds of target undershooting effects in a contextually assimilated manner.

Trajectory distribution has a time varying variance such that the variance shown as the vertical spread of trajectory distribution in is different at different points in time. As shown by Equation 10 the value of the variance of the trajectory at any point in time is a function of the variance of past targets and the variance of future targets in the sequence of targets as well as the stiffness parameters associated with the segments.

As mentioned above because of the shorter duration of each segment the predicted VTR trajectories do not come as close to the target values in as they did in . Thus as the duration of a speech segment shortens there is an increase in the reduction of the VTR trajectories predicted by the second model. This agrees well with the observed reductions in VTR trajectories as speech segments shorten. Also the variance of the trajectory does not change as much for the shorter speech segments but instead stays within a smaller range of variances.

In the second model VTR target means and variances are estimated using sample statistics for empirically estimated VTR targets for each of multiple speakers in a training set.

The second VTR model can be utilized in a speech synthesis system in a manner similar to the first model. However when the second model is utilized speech excitation system will employ targets defined by Equation 7 instead of by Equation 4.

Further the embodiments described above for both VTR models are useful in developing speech recognition systems. It should be noted the first VTR model defined by Equations 4 through 6 and the second VTR model defined by Equations 7 through 10 constitute two different embodiments of a first stage Stage I of a two stage hidden trajectory model HTM for structured speech. Two alternative approaches for implementing a second stage Stage II of the two stage HTM one using the output provided by the first VTR model a cascaded approach and the other an extension of the second VTR model an integrated approach .

In the first implementation of the second stage of the HTM the VTR vector z k at each time frame k is converted into a corresponding vector of linear predictive coding LPC cepstra o k . Thus the smooth dynamic pattern of z k output from the first VTR model is mapped to a dynamic pattern of o k which is typically less smooth reflecting quantal properties in speech production. The mapping as has been implemented is in a memory less fashion i.e. no temporal smoothing and is statistical rather than deterministic.

To describe this mapping function the VTR vector has been decomposed into a set of K resonant frequencies f f f . . . f and bandwidths b b b . . . b and z f b . Then the statistical mapping from VTR to cepstrum which constitutes one approach for implementing the second stage of the HTM is represented by Equation 11 where v k is a sub segment dependent for notational simplicity the label s is used to denote a segment as well as for a sub segment zero mean Gaussian random vector v N v 0 and is a subsegment dependent bias vector for the nonlinear predictive function F z . A subsegment of a phone is defined to be a consecutive temporal portion of the phone segment. Linear concatenation of several subsegments constitutes a phone segment. In Equation 11 the output of the mapping function F z has the following parameter free analytical form for its n th vector component i.e. n th order cepstrum 

As described above in connection with Equations 11 and 12 the first approach for implementing the second stage of the HTM involves converting the VTR trajectory output by the first VTR model defined by Equations 4 through 6 into cepstra. However the second approach defined by Equations 7 through 10 utilizes outputs from the second VTR model and therefore needs to account for uncertainty in VTR dynamics. Thus in the second approach there is a need to characterize cepstrum uncertainty in terms of its conditional distribution on the VTR and to simplify the distribution to a computationally tractable form. That is there is a need to specify and approximate p o z s . The first approach is described below in connection with which are discussed together.

First a waveform representative of speech is received by the recognizer. This is illustrated at step . The waveform may be generated from human speech or may be provided from a data file such as a TIMIT Texas Instruments Massachusetts Institute of Technology database or other databases can be used.

This speech signal is sampled by analog to digital converter and converted into digital values. For example the received waveform can be representative of the utterance He has never himself done anything for which to be hated which of us has The digital values are provided to a frame constructor which groups the digital values into overlapping windows. The frames of digital values are provided to LPC Cepstral Generator which generates a LPC cepstral feature vector for each frame of the speech waveform using any known technique typically involving identifying peaks in the spectrum of the frame of speech. This is illustrated at step .

The LPC cepstral feature vectors are provided to HMM recognition unit which applies an acoustic Hidden Markov Model to the sequence of feature vectors to identify N Best hypotheses for phonetic sequences that can be represented by the speech signal. Each hypothesis includes an alignment between the frames and the phonetic units of the hypothesis.

For each hypothesized sequence of phonetic units VTR trajectory generator generates a VTR trajectory using the sequence of VTR targets associated with the hypothesized sequence of phonetic units. To begin this process any compound phones in the sequence are broken into their constituents. Initial target values for the individual phones are then retrieved based on limited context dependency by table lookup. Next automatic and iterative target adaptation is performed for each phone like unit based on the difference between the results of a VTR tracker and the VTR prediction from the FIR filter model. This is illustrated at step .

In this embodiment a single target value for each segment is used and the VTR trajectory is calculated using equations 1 6 above. The VTR trajectory or distribution of VTR trajectories produced by VTR trajectory generator is provided to LPC cepstral prediction generator which generates predictions of the LPC cepstral feature vectors based upon the trajectories or distributions of trajectories generated by the trajectory generator . This is illustrated at step . A single VTR trajectory is provided to LPC cepstral prediction generator a single LPC cepstral feature vector is produced using Equations 11 and 12 above. illustrates the predicted LPC cepstra for the example input. For purposes of clarity only LPC cepstra with orders one two and three are illustrated. These orders are represented by reference numbers and respectively. Dashed lines and represent the cepstral data computed directly from the waveform at step .

Following the generation of the LPC cepstra for the VTR trajectory the recognizer identifies the relative closeness or probability of the predicted LPC cepstra with the LPC cepstra generated from the waveform. This is illustrated at step . The recognizer according to one embodiment of the present invention is based on the N best re scoring paradigm. At this step the recognizer subtracts the nonlinear prediction of LPC cepstra according Equation 12 from the LPC cepstral data generated from the original waveform.

Scoring module receives the predicted LPC cepstral feature vectors or the distribution parameters for the LPC cepstral feature vectors from the generator and the LPC cepstral feature vectors for the speech waveform from the generator and generates a score based on the amount of similarity between the speech signal s feature vector and the predictions for the LPC feature vector produced by generator . In particular for embodiments where a single predicted LPC cepstral feature vector is provided a cascade scoring technique is used.

In the cascaded implementation it is assumed that given segment s there is no variability in the VTR targets for a fixed speaker and consequently there is no variability in the VTR variable z in each frame within the segment. Such variability is absorbed into the random component in the first implementation of the second stage of the HTM Equations 10 and 11 . That is both z and T are treated as deterministic instead of random variables. Hence it follows that p z s 1 for z zas generated from the FIR filter and p z s 0 otherwise. Segment dependent and speaker specific targets Tin the training data are obtained by an iterative adaptative algorithm that adjusts Tso that the FIR output from Equation 5 matches with minimal errors the automatically tracked VTR produced from the algorithm described in L. Deng I. Bazzi and A. Acero. Tracking Vocal Tract Resonances Using an Analytical Nonlinear Predictor and a Target Guided Temporal Constraint Proc. Eurospeech 2003 pp. 73 76. For the test data targets are estimated using an algorithm similar to vocal tract length normalization techniques.

To compute the acoustic likelihood required for scoring in recognition the above stage I output z zas the deterministic signal is passed to LPC generator to produce the cepstral prediction F z k on a frame by frame basis where each component of F z k is calculated using equation 12 above. For each frame of the observed cepstral vector o k within each segment s or subsegment the approximate likelihood score is defined as 

In the embodiment that calculates the difference this difference is calculated separately for each of the N best hypotheses computed from a state of the art triphone Hidden Markov Model and forms the residual sequence that follows a monophone Hidden Markov Model. In one embodiment the recognizer uses an HTK tool Hvite to directly compute the likelihood for the residual sequence. However other tools can be used. The results of this set of computations are re ranked as the recognizer s final output.

One aspect of the recognizer design of the present invention is to naturally incorporate the delta and acceleration features into the recognizer. One feature of the present invention is to decompose LPC cepstral feature differentials delta and acceleration into a component that can be predicted from the VTR according to Equation 12 and a component that cannot be predicted i.e. the residuals k of Equation 11. For the predictable component the present invention directly computes the frame differentials of the predicted LPC cepstral values. For the unpredictable component the present invention trains the delta and acceleration parameters of means and variances for the residuals using the corresponding frame differential LPC cepstral training data. One advantage of this technique for treating delta and acceleration features is that in the degenerative case where the predictive model component of equation 12 is removed by setting it to zero the recognizer automatically becomes a conventional monophone Hidden Markov Model system.

To compute the residual likelihood at step the present invention requires that residual means and variances of each substate of each phone in the N best hypotheses are known. The training of recognizer follows a similar process as that used for recognition and disclosed above with respect to except that the step of rescoring the results is omitted. In one embodiment the parameters are trained from the TIMIT training set. However other training sets can be used. In this embodiment a two stage acoustic model using a standard 61 label set which are folded into 48 classes is used in training the residual means and variances for each subsegment of each class. VTR targets are trained and then adapted for each phone segment instead of sub segment. For diphthongs and affricates two separate targets are trained assuming one target following another. Again as in given the training script including both phone sequences and phone boundaries trajectory generator generates deterministic VTR trajectories and LPC cepstral predictor generates predicted cepstral trajectories from the VTR trajectories. The scoring module subtracts the predicted cepstral trajectories from the cepstral training data on a frame by frame basis giving residuals for the training set. Treating these residuals as the training data an HTK tool is applied to train a set of residual monophones Hidden Markov Models. The mean and variance parameters of these models are then used for N best rescoring.

As described above the cascaded implementation assumes that for a given segment s there is no variability uncertainty in the VTR targets for a fixed speaker and consequently there is no variability uncertainty in the VTR variable z in each frame within the segment. However the integrated implementation described below takes into consideration variability uncertainty in the VTR targets and the VTR variable z. This variability makes it impossible to know the trajectory with any certainty given the segment. As such the trajectories must be integrated marginalized out of the likelihood calculation.

For embodiments where a distribution of VTR trajectories is provided parameters representing a distribution of LPC Cepstral feature vectors are produced using the following equation N Equation 14

For computational tractability in marginalization there is a need to linearize the nonlinear mean function of F z k in Equation 14. This can be carried out by using the following first order Taylor series approximation to the nonlinear mean function Equation 15 where the components of the Jacobian above n th order cepstrum s derivative with respect to the pth component of VTR z are 

Substituting Equation 15 into Equation 14 the approximate conditional acoustic observation probability is obtained where the mean is expressed as a linear function of the VTR variable z 

Give the above results the integration marginalization over the random VTR variable z in computing the acoustic likelihood can be proceeded analytically as follows 

A speech signal is sampled by analog to digital converter and converted into digital values. The digital values are provided to a frame constructor which groups the digital values into overlapping windows. The frames of digital values are provided to LPC Cepstral Generator which generates a LPC cepstral feature vector for each frame of the speech waveform using any known technique typically involving identifying peaks in the spectrum of the frame of speech. It should be noted that embodiments of the integrated approach use a distribution of target values for each segment a distribution of VTR trajectories is calculated using equations 8 10 above. Computations are carried out by the components of in a manner similar to those carried out by the components of . However the components of carry out these computations based on Equations 14 22.

As mentioned above in the cascaded implementation the parameters of the cepstral prediction residuals and are trained using the standard Baum Welch algorithm HTK tool for monophones on the prediction residual signals. It can be easily shown that this gives maximum likelihood ML parameter estimates for the likelihood function of Equation 11. However in the integrated implementation where the likelihood function is in the form of Equation 21 a new training technique is required which has been developed by the inventors and is described below.

The following is an example of phonetic recognition results which can be used to evaluate the bi directional target filtering HTM for both the cascaded and integrated approaches. This example is based on the widely used TIMIT database and no language model is used in this example. The acoustic models are based on HTMs using the standard TIMIT label set with slight expansion for diphthongs and affricates in training the residual means and variances.

Phonetic recognition errors are tabulated using the 39 labels adopted by many researchers to report recognition results. The results are reported on the standard core test set with a total of 192 utterances by 24 speakers. An N best rescoring paradigm is used to evaluate the HTM. For each of the core test utterances A standard triphone Hidden Markov Model with a decision tree is used to generate a very large N best list list of plausible hypotheses where N 1000. The average number over the 192 utterances of distinct phone sequences in this N 1000 list is 788 the remaining being due to variations in the phone segmentation in the same phone sequence. With the use of a flat phone language model and of the LPC cepstra as features the same conditions as the HTM the phone recognition accuracy for the HTK implemented standard triphone Hidden Markov Model in N best list rescoring with N 1001 and without N 1000 adding reference hypotheses is 64.04 . The sentence recognition accuracy is 0.0 for Hidden Markov Model even with references included. That is the Hidden Markov Model system does not score the reference phone sequence higher than the N best candidates for any of the 192 test sentences. The HTM systems dramatically increase both phone and sentence recognition accuracies as shown in Table 1 further below. The HTM performances for two types of cascaded Cascaded Stage I and Cascaded Stage II and integrated Integrated Stage I and Integrated Stage II implementations are evaluated. First the HTM with Cascaded Stage I implementation uses Equation 11 for likelihood scoring with the residual parameters circumflex over circumflex over trained by HTK based on the residual features computed as the difference between cepstral data and cepstral prediction. Second a Cascaded Stage II implementation uses Equation 11 for scoring also but with the parameters circumflex over and circumflex over trained using Equations 26 and 30. A noticeable performance improvement is obtained after the new training. Third an Integrated Stage I implementation uses Equation 21 for scoring with the parameters circumflex over and circumflex over trained by HTK in the same way as for the Cascaded Stage I implementation. Rather poor performance is observed. Finally an Integrated Stage II implementation uses Equation 16 for scoring with the parameters circumflex over and circumflex over trained using Equations 26 and 30. The best performance both in sentence and phone recognition accuracies is achieved the Integrated Stage II implementation. The improvement is the greatest when references are added into the N best list. Table 1 below includes a comparison of test results for the above described four types of HTM implementations and for a triphone Hidden Markov Model HMM baseline with context dependent parameters .

In the above experiments performance is measured by percent sentence sent and phone phn recognition accuracies in the core test set defined in the TIMIT database.

Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
