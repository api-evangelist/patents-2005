title: Hardware acceleration system for logic simulation using shift register as local cache
abstract: A logic simulation processor stores in a shift register intermediate values generated during the logic simulation. The simulation processor includes multiple processor units and an interconnect system that communicatively couples the processor units to each other. Each of the processor units includes a processor element configurable to simulate at least a logic gate, and a shift register associated with the processor element. The shift register includes multiple entries to store the intermediate values, and is coupled to receive the output of the processor element. Each of the processor units further includes one or more multiplexers for selecting one of the entries of the shift register as outputs to be coupled to the interconnect system. Each of the processor units may further include a local memory for storing data from, and loading the data to, the simulation processor.
