Models that provide a prior probability of clean speech are often used in speech recognition and speech enhancement. These models indicate the probability of a clean speech feature vector without reference to an observed noisy feature vector. These prior models are typically trained by collecting speech signals in a noise free environment from a small set of people.

Because only a small number of people are used to form the prior models of clean speech differences between the speech of the people who train the model and the speech of the end users can be a source of error during recognition or enhancement. In particular variations in the loudness of the speech signals due to variations in the speaker s voice or variations in the microphones that are used can cause errors in recognition and enhancement.

To reduce errors due to changes in loudness and changes in the gains of recording devices while at the same time maintaining information about the phase of the speech signal the claimed embodiments use energy normalized complex spectra as features for a speech model. In particular the spectral components of a frame of the speech signal are normalized with the energy of the frame as 

Thus all tilde over X are unit vectors and distribute on a unit hypersphere. It can be easily seen that forming the energy normalized complex spectra reduces the variance because instead of attempting to capture the variations in an N dimensional space a region on a unit hypershpere is modeled.

In step of a speech signal from a speaker is received by a microphone sensor which converts the speech signal into an electrical analog signal. The analog signal is converted into a digital signal at step by an analog to digital converter . In one embodiment A to D converter samples the analog signal at 16 kilohertz and 16 bits per sample thereby creating 256 kilobits of speech data per second. The digital values are provided to a frame constructor which constructs frames at step . Under one embodiment a new frame is constructed for every 10 milliseconds of data and includes 20 milliseconds worth of data. Such frames can include square windowing or other types of known windowing.

At step a Fast Fourier Transform is performed on each frame of data. Under one embodiment this Fast Fourier Transform involves converting N digital samples into N 2 1 frequency components where each frequency component has a magnitude and a phase. At step the DC frequency component and the Nyquist frequency component are removed from the Fast Fourier Transform by filter to produce a filtered spectral domain feature vector. This helps to add robustness to the final model but is optional and may be omitted.

The filtered spectral domain feature vector is provided to a spectral energy calculator which uses Equation 2 above to calculate the energy for the frame at step . At step the filtered spectral domain feature vector is normalized by normalization unit using the energy value for the frame and Equation 1 above. This forms an energy normalized spectral domain feature vector. The steps described above for forming an energy normalized spectral domain feature vector are repeated for a set of frames resulting in a set of energy normalized spectral domain feature vectors that represent a plurality of utterances in a training speech signal.

At step the set of energy normalized spectral domain feature vectors generated from the frames of the training speech signal are applied to a training algorithm to form an acoustic model . Any desired technique for training acoustic models from feature vectors may be used to train the model from the energy normalized feature vectors. Under one embodiment a mixture of Gaussians model is formed as acoustic model using a k means clustering algorithm with random initialization. This algorithm clusters the energy normalized vectors into mixture components based on a distance measure and produces a separate Gaussian model for each mixture component. Under one embodiment the distance between two energy normalized vectors is defined as 

The clustering algorithm can be used to form mixture components for separate states. In particular by using a speech detector two states can be identified in the training signal one for speech and one for non speech also referred to as silence. Energy normalized vectors that fall within the speech state are then clustered into one set of mixture components and energy normalized vectors that fall within the silence state are clustered into a separate set of mixture components. Under one embodiment a single mixture component is provided for the silence state while a plurality of mixture components are provided for the speech state.

After the models have been formed they may be used at step for speech enhancement or speech recognition. When acoustic model is used for speech recognition the feature vectors applied to the model must match the feature vectors used to train the model. As such the same Fast Fourier Transform filtering and energy normalization operations steps are performed on the feature vectors that are to be applied to the model. Once input energy normalized feature vectors have been produced from the input signal they are applied to the models to determine a probability of the input energy normalized feature vectors.

The energy normalization of the vectors used to form the model and the vectors applied to the model helps remove variations in the loudness of the speech used to train the model as well as differences in loudness between the speech used to train the model and the speech used during recognition. Further because the model is trained in the spectral domain phase information is retained within the model. This would not be true if the model had been trained using cepstral vectors instead of spectral domain vectors since phase information is lost during the transform from the spectral domain to the cepstral domain.

Energy normalization in the spectral domain may also be used to enhance one or more noisy signals to produce a clean signal that may be applied to a speech process such as speech recognition or speech coding. provides one example of a system in which energy normalization can be used for speech enhancement.

In a speaker generates a speech signal X that is detected by an air conduction microphone and an alternative sensor . Examples of alternative sensors include a throat microphone that measures the user s throat vibrations a bone conduction sensor that is located on or adjacent to a facial or skull bone of the user such as the jaw bone or in the ear of the user and that senses vibrations of the skull and jaw that correspond to speech generated by the user. Air conduction microphone is the type of microphone that is used commonly to convert audio air waves into electrical signals.

Air conduction microphone receives ambient noise V generated by one or more noise sources and generates its own sensor noise U . Depending on the type of ambient noise and the level of the ambient noise ambient noise may also be detected by alternative sensor . However under some embodiments alternative sensor is typically less sensitive to ambient noise than air conduction microphone . Thus the alternative sensor signal B generated by alternative sensor generally includes less noise than air conduction microphone signal Y generated by air conduction microphone . Although alternative sensor is less sensitive to ambient noise it does generate some sensor noise W .

The path from speaker to alternative sensor signal can be modeled as a channel having a channel response H. The path from ambient noise to alternative sensor signal can be modeled as a channel having a channel response G.

Alternative sensor signal B and air conduction microphone signal Y are provided to a clean signal estimator which estimates a clean signal . Clean signal estimate is provided to a speech process . Clean signal estimate may either be a time domain signal or a spectral domain vector. If clean signal estimate is a time domain signal speech process may take the form of a listener a speech coding system or a speech recognition system. If clean signal estimate is a spectral domain vector speech process will typically be a speech recognition system or contain an Inverse Fourier Transform to convert the spectral domain vector into waveforms.

Within clean signal estimator alternative sensor signal and microphone signal are converted into the domain being used to estimate the clean speech. As shown in the embodiment of alternative sensor signal and air conduction microphone signal are provided to analog to digital converters and respectively to generate a sequence of digital values which are grouped into frames of values by frame constructors and respectively. In one embodiment A to D converters and sample the analog signals at 16 kHz and 16 bits per sample thereby creating 32 kilobytes of speech data per second and frame constructors and create a new respective frame every 10 milliseconds that includes 20 milliseconds worth of data.

Each respective frame of data provided by frame constructors and is converted into the spectral domain using Fast Fourier Transforms FFT and respectively.

The spectral domain values for the alternative sensor signal and the air conduction microphone signal are provided to clean signal estimator which uses the spectral domain values to estimate clean speech signal .

Under some embodiments clean speech signal is converted back to the time domain using Inverse Fast Fourier Transforms . This creates a time domain version of clean speech signal .

In the model of clean speech X is based upon energy normalized speech tilde over X as applied to a gain g such that X gtilde over X . Energy normalized speech is dependent on state S and mixture component M which is also dependent on state . Air conduction microphone signal Y is dependent on sensor noise U ambient noise V and clean speech signal . Alternative sensor signal B is dependent on sensor noise W clean speech signal as it passes through a channel response H and ambient noise V as it passes through a channel response G .

The model of is used in speech enhancement to estimate a clean speech signal Xfrom noisy observations Yand B.

Under one embodiment the clean speech signal estimate and the likelihoods of the states for the clean speech signal estimate are formed by first assuming Gaussian distributions for the noise components in the system model. Thus V N 0 EQ. 4 U N 0 EQ. 5 W N 0 EQ. 6 where each noise component is modeled as a zero mean Gaussian having respective variances and V is the ambient noise U is the sensor noise in the air conduction microphone and W is the sensor noise in the alternative sensor.

In the description of the equations below for determining the estimate of the clean speech signal all of the variables are modeled in the complex spectral domain. Each frequency component is treated independently of the other frequency components except for variables Sand M. Sand Mare global for each frame. For ease of notation the method is described below for a single frequency component. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the computations are performed for each frequency component in the spectral version of the input signals. For variables that vary with time a subscript t is added to the variable.

To estimate the clean speech signal Xfrom the noisy observations Yand B some embodiments use the conditional probability p tilde over X Y B which is the probability of the energy normalized clean speech signal given the noisy air conduction microphone signal and the noisy alternative sensor signal. Since the estimate of the energy normalized clean speech signal depends on the speech state Sand the mixture component Munder the model this conditional probability is determined as 

In some embodiments two states s are provided one for speech and one for silence. Any number of mixture components may be used including mixture components for voiced sounds fricatives nasal sounds and back vowel sounds. In some embodiments a separate mixture component is provided for each of a set of phonetic units such as phonemes. Under one particular embodiment four mixture components are provided for the speech state and one mixture component is provided for the silence state.

Under one embodiment the probability p tilde over X Y B M m S s is estimated as a Gaussian distribution N tilde over X A with mean Aand variance where 

Under one embodiment the mixture component m and the state s are shared across all frequency components. As noted above the computations to this point are performed separately for each frequency component. However since the mixture component and state are shared across frequency components the posterior probabilities p M m S s Y B and p S s Y B are approximated by aggregating the likelihoods due to each frequency component. This results in 

Under some embodiments the conditional probabilities of the mixture components for each state are evenly divided among the components associated with the state. Thus in embodiments where there is a single mixture component for the silence state the conditional probability is silence component silence 1 Eq. 24 and where there are M mixture components for the speech state the probability of each component is determined as speech 1 Eq. 25 Under some embodiments the prior probability for the states are divided evenly between speech and silence. In other embodiments smoothness of the states between frames is introduced by basing the prior probability of each state on the posterior probability of the state in the preceding frame such that 

At step noisy input speech signals are received and at step frames of the input speech signals are identified where the user is not speaking. These frames are then used to determine the variance for the ambient noise the variance for the alternative sensor noise and the variance for the air conduction microphone noise .

To identify frames where the user is not speaking the alternative sensor signal can be examined. Since the alternative sensor signal will produce much smaller signal values for background speech than for noise when the energy of the alternative sensor signal is low it can initially be assumed that the speaker is not speaking. The values of the air conduction microphone signal and the alternative sensor signal for frames that do not contain speech are stored in a buffer and are used to compute variances of the noise as 

Under some embodiments the technique of identifying non speech frames based on low energy levels in the alternative sensor signal is only performed during the initial frames of training. After initial values have been formed for the noise variances they may be used to determine which frames contain speech and which frames do not contain speech using a likelihood ratio discussed below.

The variance of the noise for the air conduction microphone is estimated based on the observation that the air conduction microphone is less prone to sensor noise than the alternative sensor. As such the variance of the air conduction microphone can be calculated as 1e EQ. 32

At step the next frame of the air microphone signal Yand alternative sensor signal Bis selected. At step the prior probabilities of the states are determined using equations 26 and 27 above. These prior probabilities are then used at step to determine the likelihood for each state given the current frame of the air microphone signal Yand alternative sensor signal Busing equations 19 27 above. The likelihoods for each state are used to classify the current frame as speech or silence by forming a ratio 

At step the alternative sensor s channel response G for background noise and the alternative sensor s channel response H for speech are estimated from the signals of the air microphone Y and of the alternative sensor B. In particular channel response G is estimated using the last D frames of Y and B in which the user is not speaking as identified using equation 33. Specifically G is determined as 

The alternative sensor s channel response H for the clean speech signal is estimated from the signals of the air microphone Y and of the alternative sensor B across the last T frames in which the user is speaking. Specifically H is determined as 

At step an iteration is started in which the gain gand an estimate of the energy normalized clean speech value tilde over X are iteratively determined. Under one embodiment the gain is calculated in step as 

At step tilde over X is estimated using equations 8 19 above to determine the expected value of tilde over X . At step the estimate of the energy normalized clean speech value tilde over X is examined to determine if it has converged. If it has not converged the process returns to step to update the gain. Steps and are repeated until the energy normalized clean speech value converges.

Once the energy normalized clean speech value converges it is multiplied by the gain at step to form the estimate of the clean speech value as X gtilde over X Eq. 38

At step the method determines if this is the last frame of the input signals. If this is not the last frame the process returns to step to select the next frame. Steps through are then performed to identify a clean speech signal from the noisy input signals for the selected frame. When the last frame of the noisy input signals is reached at step the process ends at step .
