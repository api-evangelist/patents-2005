This application is a Divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 10 660 386 filed on Sep. 11 2003 still pending.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by the U.S. Government for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

The invention relates to footwear and is directed more particularly to an article of footwear with temperature regulation means.

Footwear provided with means for circulating cooling or ventilation air through the footwear is generally known. For example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 000 566 issued Jan. 4 1977 in the name of Joseph P. Famolare there is shown footwear having air channels in the sole. The channels open at air ports in the edges of the sole. The air ports and channels provide for circulation of air through the channels.

In U.S. Pat. No. 5 996 250 issued Dec. 7 1999 in the name of Rusty A. Reed et al there is disclosed an air ventilation system in the sole the system including pressure operated pumps for forcing ventilating air through the system.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 799 319 issued Jan. 24 1989 in the name of Max Zellweger discloses a foot warming system in the insole of footwear. The warming system includes elongated tubular members which are closed and have flow restrictions therein. Walking in the footwear causes the liquid in the tubular members to flow back and forth through the restrictors which thereby heat the liquid and thereby the insole.

In U.S. Pat. No. 6 041 518 issued Mar. 28 2000 in the name of Phito Polycarpe there is shown and described footwear having a battery heater and fan in the sole to heat and circulate warm air in the sole and through an insole and insert to warm a foot in the footwear.

In spite of advances as illustrated in the above referred to references there remains a need for footwear which can selectively heat and cool the foot of a wearer. In particular there is a need for an article of footwear which is able to provide robust and appropriate relief in both the arctic and in Equatorial zones.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide an article of footwear having facility for providing substantial heating or cooling of the foot of a wearer of the footwear.

With the above and other objects in view a feature of the invention is the provision of footwear with temperature regulation means. The footwear comprises a sole forming a bottom of the footwear an insole overlying the sole and in contact with the sole the insole having in an upper surface thereof opposite from the sole a groove having an inlet and an outlet in an edge of the insole the groove winding substantially throughout the length and width of the insole upper surface with a plurality of generally 180 turns in the insole. A tube is disposed in the groove and extends throughout the length of the groove and is provided with an inlet portion extending from the groove inlet at the edge of the insole and an outlet portion extending from the groove outlet at the edge of the insole. An upper is fixed to the sole and is provided with apertures therethrough through which extend the tube inlet and outlet portions. A holding member is fixed to the upper and covers the tube inlet and outlet portions. A liquid reservoir is provided having temperature influencing means therewith and connected to remote ends of the tube inlet and outlet portions. In operation temperature conditioned liquid is flowed from the liquid reservoir through the tube to provide a selected temperature to the insole and flowed back to the liquid reservoir for a further cycle.

In accordance with a further feature of the invention there is provided footwear with temperature regulation means. The footwear comprises a sole forming a bottom of the footwear an upper fixed to the sole an insole fixed to overlie an upper surface of the sole and overlie inwardly extending edge portions of the upper. The footwear includes an insert for selective insertion and removal from the interior of the footwear and adapted upon insertion to overlie the insole the insert having in a selected surface thereof a groove having an inlet and an outlet in an edge of the insert the groove winding substantially throughout the length and width of the insert selected surface with a plurality of generally 180 turns in the insert. A tube is disposed in the groove and extends throughout the length of the groove and is provided with an inlet portion extending from the groove inlet at the edge of the insert and an outlet portion extending from the groove outlet at the edge of the insert. The footwear is further provided with first and second tubes mounted on the upper and having first ends proximate the apertures and adapted for engagement with the tube inlet and outlet portions and having second ends remote from the insert. A liquid reservoir is provided having temperature influencing means therewith and connected to remote ends of the first and second tubes. In operation temperature conditioned liquid is flowed from the liquid reservoir through the first tube to provide a selected temperature to the insert and flowed back through the second tube to the liquid reservoir for a further cycle.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular devices embodying the invention are shown by way of illustration only and not as limitations of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that an illustrative article of footwear includes a sole forming a bottom of the footwear. An insole overlies the sole . The insole is provided with a groove in one surface thereof . The groove includes an inlet and outlet in an edge of the insole .

As shown in the groove winds substantially throughout the length and width of the insole surface with several generally 180 turns therein.

The insole preferably is of a breathable urethane foam sufficiently flexible to serve as a footwear insole material and sufficiently rigid to render the groove non compressible under typical human weight load conditions.

Referring to it will be seen that into the groove in the surface of the insole there is placed a tube which extends throughout the length f the groove and having an inlet portion extending from the groove inlet at the edge of the insole and an outlet portion extending from the groove outlet at the edge of the insole. The tube preferably is of a heat conducting polymer such as PVC.

An upper is fixed to the sole and is provided with apertures therethrough through which extend the tube inlet and outlet portions .

In a preferred embodiment the groove is about 5 32 inch wide and 5 32 inch deep and the tube is provided with a diameter of about 5 32 inch and an inside diameter of about 3 32 inch. The tube may be provided with a thin coating of thermally activatable material on the exterior of the tube.

The footwear is provided with a holding member which serves as a protective covering fixed to the footwear upper . The tube inlet and outlet portions extend through the holding member and are protected thereby.

When the footwear takes the form of a boot the tube inlet and outlet portions extend from the upper apertures proximate a heel portion of the boot up the back of a bootleg portion to proximate the top of the bootleg portion.

A thermoelectric cooler heater unit may be fastened to the top of the bootleg portion or may be mountable on the clothing of the wearer. In either case the tube portions are connected to the unit . A sock lining may be placed over the insole as shown in .

In an alternative embodiment shown in the sole and upper are substantially as shown and described relative to the embodiment shown in . However the insole is a traditional insole and there is provided an insert made and structured as described hereinabove with respect to the insole of the embodiment of .

Accordingly the insert is provided with the above described groove and tube . In this embodiment the tube inlet and outlet portions are fed through the apertures in the upper the holding member and plugged into the thermoelectric cooler heater unit . The insert is then slid into position overlying the insole . In footwear of a shoe configuration rather than a boot configuration the cooler heater unit is generally carried on the person of the shoe wearer.

In the insert is shown with the groove and tube disposed on the undersurface of the insert. Alternatively the groove and tube may be provided on the upper surface of the insert. In such instances the sock lining may be placed so as to overlie the insert .

In manufacture the groove may be formed in the urethane insole and inset by a heated die under pressure . In a preferred method of manufacture an aluminum die is heated to about 400 F. and applied to the insole material under pressure of about 500 p.s.i. Partial heating of the insole is an optional aid in the process. The die includes upstanding ridges which form the grooves .

In either embodiment the cooling or heating is regenerative in nature with water or other liquid continuously flowed through the tube for control of foot temperature.

In addition to being useful in hot or cold climates the footwear described herein finds utility in serving the needs of foundry workers police and fire personnel hunters miners and people suffering from certain medical conditions. Further the above described manufacturing process may be used for producing other sheets of material for beneficially providing a cooled or heated surface such as sleeping bag mats tent floors and the like which typically undergo stresses produced by people walking lying or sitting thereon.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.

The foregoing describes the invention in terms of embodiments foreseen by the inventors and for which an enabling description is available. Insubstantial modifications of the invention not presently foreseen may nonetheless represent equivalents.
