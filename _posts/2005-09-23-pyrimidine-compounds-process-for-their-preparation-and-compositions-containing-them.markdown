This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 612 374 filed Sep. 23 2004 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to substituted pyrimidine compounds methods and compositions for making and using substituted pyrimidine compounds and methods for preventing or treating diseases in humans or animals employing such compounds and compositions.

Novel compounds for new therapeutic interventions are needed for many areas of medicine and disease treatment. For example chronic and acute inflammatory conditions form the basis for diseases affecting all organ systems including but not limited to asthma acute inflammatory diseases vascular inflammatory disease chronic inflammation atherosclerosis angiopathy myocarditis nephritis Crohn s disease arthritis type I and II diabetes and associated vascular pathologies. The incidence of these inflammatory conditions is on the rise in the population as a whole with diabetes alone affecting 16 million people. Therefore synthesis of novel compounds leads to new possibilities for discovery of novel therapeutic interventions.

While inflammation in and of itself is a normal immune response chronic inflammation leads to complications and ongoing system damage due to the interactions of unknown cellular factors. In particular chronic inflammation can cause endothelial damage resulting in vascular complications. Coronary artery cerbrovascular and peripheral vascular disease resulting from atherosclerotic and thromboembolic macroangiopathy are the primary causes of mortality in chronic inflammatory diseases.

Many humans and animals have limited lifespans and lifestyles because of conditions relating to lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise or because of genetic predispositions to develop a disease. For example vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation is a common consequence of endothelial injury and is believed to be an early pathogenetic event in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques or complications related to vascular injury or as a result surgical interventions. Abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell SMC proliferation is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular occlusive lesions including arteriosclerosis atherosclerosis restenosis and graft atherosclerosis after organ transplantation.

One disease that rapidly growing in the industrialized countries is the occurrence of diabetes and all of its attendant sequellae. One of the factors important in the damage associated with diabetes is the presence of glycated proteins. Glycated proteins and advanced glycation end products AGE contribute to cellular damage particularly diabetic tissue injury. One potential mechanism by which hyperglycemia can be linked to microangiopathies is through the process of non enzymatic glycation of critical proteins. These are a highly reactive group of molecules whose interaction with specific receptors on the cell surface which are thought to lead to pathogenic outcomes.

Another major area of unwanted cellular growth that is unchecked by the body s regulatory systems is cancer or oncological conditions. Many therapies have been used and are being used in an effort to restore health or at least stop the unwanted cell growth. Many times therapeutic agents can have an effect individually but often therapeutic regimes require combinations of different pharmacological agents with treatments such as surgery or radiation.

There is a present need for treatments of chronic or acute diseases such as atherosclerosis unwanted cellular growth or cellular proliferation diabetes inflammatory conditions and vascular occlusive pathologic conditions. Because of occurrence is frequent the currently available treatments are costly and the conditions are refractory to many pharmacological therapies. The mechanisms involved in the control or prevention of such diseases are not clear and there exists a need for preventive and therapeutic treatments of these and other diseases. Thus what is presently needed are novel compounds that find utility in methods and compositions for treatment and prevention of chronic and acute diseases to which the present invention is directed.

One aspect of the present invention relates to methods and compositions for the treatment and prevention of SMC proliferation preferably comprising compositions and compounds having cellular antiproliferative activity. These compounds as described herein and compositions comprising such compounds are referred to as antiproliferative compounds or compositions. At least one activity of one or more of these compounds is that the compound has the activity of affecting the synthesis of proteoglycans including induction and synthesis of proteoglycans and active fragments of proteoglycans. Thus one aspect of the activity of one or more of the compounds and compositions of the present invention comprise molecules that induce HSPG production and that regulate SMC proliferation.

Compounds of the present invention that have at least the activity of affecting cellular proliferation are shown in Table 4.

Methods for identifying the activity and screening for one or more of these compounds or molecules that induce synthesis of proteoglycans such as HSPG are taught in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 091 357 which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Assays of effects of compounds in vivo are also taught in the incorporated references and are known to those skilled in the art. In general methods comprise the addition of such compounds to assays and measurement of HSPG synthesis including but not limited to the production of syndecans glypicans and perlecans for example syndecans 1 2 and 4 and glypican 1. Other assays that can be used to determine the activity of the compounds of the present invention include other methods for measuring the induction of perlecan synthesis. For example in one assay perlecan is induced in cells by certain inducers and the response is measured. Compounds of the present invention are then added to a replicate assay and the effect on perlecan induction is determined. Using such methods compounds are determined that can either inhibit perlecan elevate induction of perlecan or that have no effect at all. Those compounds that are effective as therapeutic agents can then be used in animals humans or patients with cellular proliferation disease aspects such as vascular associated diseases or SMC smooth muscle cell proliferation pathologies.

Another assay for determining compounds having SMC effects comprises adding a composition suspected of effecting SMC proliferation to smooth muscle cells in growth medium or serum free medium. The change in cell proliferation can be measured by methods known to those skilled in the art such as incorporation of labeled nucleotides into dividing cells DNA and compared to the proliferation of cells which are not treated with the compound. Other measurements include directly determining levels of HSPG synthesis by measuring the amount or change in amount of HSPG such as with ELISA for HSPGs and compared to the amount of HSPG synthesis in untreated cells. Other indirect or direct measurements are contemplated by the present invention and are known to those skilled in the art. For example such methods include but are not limited to measurement of RNA levels RT PCR Northern blotting Western blotting promoter based assays to identify compounds that affect one or more proteoglycans and assays for proteoglycan biological activity shown by recombinant proteins partially purified proteins or lysates from cells expressing proteoglycans in the presence or absence of compounds of interest.

An assay for identifying and determining an activity of one or more of the compounds of the present invention comprises identifying compounds that interact with the promoter regions of a gene or interact and affect proteins that interact with the promoter region and are important in the transcriptional regulation of the protein s expression. For example if perlecan were the protein in general the method comprises a vector comprising regulatory sequences of the perlecan gene and an indicator region controlled by the regulatory sequences such as an enzyme in a promoter reporter construct. The protein product of the indicator region is referred to herein as a reporter enzyme or reporter protein. The regulatory region of the sequence of perlecan comprises a range of nucleotides from approximately 4000 to 2000 wherein the transcription initiation site is 1 more preferably from 2500 to 1200 most preferably from 1500 to 800 relative to the transcription initiation site.

Cells are transfected with a vector comprising the promoter reporter construct and then treated with one or more compositions comprising at least one compound of the present invention. For example the transfected cells are treated with a composition comprising a compound suspected of affecting the transcription of perlecan and the level of activity of the perlecan regulatory sequences are compared to the level of activity in cells that were not treated with the compound. The levels of activity of the perlecan regulatory sequences are determined by measuring the amount of the reporter protein or determining the activity of the reporter enzyme controlled by the regulatory sequences. An increase in the amount of the reporter protein or the reporter enzyme activity shows a stimulatory effect on perlecan by positively effecting the promoter whereas a decrease in the amount or the reporter protein or the reporter enzyme activity shows a negative effect on the promoter and thus on perlecan.

Additionally the present invention comprises methods and compositions that can be used with gene therapy methods and composition such as those gene therapy methods comprising administering compositions comprising nucleic acids that affect the synthesis or expression of HSPGs particularly perlecan.

The following Tables 7 10 provide disclosure and references that relate the various physiological parameters and assays disclosed herein to general and specific diseases disease states and conditions. Among other things the references and citations provided in these tables support the specification as fully enabled for treating or modulating all the diseases or conditions encompassed herein based on the inhibiting activity of the compounds provided in the specification and the predictive nature of the tests provided of the disclosed uses. In particular Tables 7 10 provide specific references that link the parameters measured in the key assays disclosed in the application with a specific physiology pathophysiology or medical condition.

Table 7 provides scientific references that demonstrate among other things the connection between TNF and IL 6 in rheumatoid arthritis vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. For example these references demonstrate the importance of TNF inhibition in preventing rheumatoid arthritis the therapeutic benefit of IL 6 inhibition in rheumatoid arthritis as well as its importance in preventing rheumatoid arthritis the role of AGE in different diabetic vascular diseases and AGE inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for vascular complications.

Further Table 8 provides scientific references that demonstrate among other things the importance of HSPG in the prevention of atherosclerosis and diabetic vascular disease. For example these references demonstrate that atherosclerotic vessels have reduced HSPG and that cholesterol deposition is inversely correlated to HSPG content in the vessel.

Table 9 also provides scientific references that demonstrate among other things the connection between smooth muscle cell SMC proliferation in contributing to restenosis and atherosclerosis. For example these references demonstrate that smooth muscle proliferation contributes to unstable angina and restenosis inhibition of SMC proliferation by LRP is important for atherosclerosis prevention and the function of the SMC inhibitor rapamycin in preventing restenosis and vein graft disease.

Table 10 provides scientific references that demonstrate among other things the role of heparanase and TNF in promoting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis as well as the use of inhibitors of heparanase and TNF in treating cancer. For example these references demonstrate the role of heparanase inhibitors in treating tumor angiogenesis and metastasis the role of TNF as a tumor promoting agent and the use of TNF inhibitors in the treatment of cancer.

The key assays described herein for screening the compounds in the present invention include but are not limited to a the inhibition of smooth muscle cell SMC proliferation that was used to identify for example compounds in Table 4 b the induction of HSPG in smooth muscle cells c the induction of heparanase in endothelial cells d the inhibition of AGE induced inflammatory response in endothelial cells as measured by IL 6 or other inflammatory cytokines that was used to identify for example compounds in Table 6 and e cytotoxicity effects of the disclosed compounds. By using these disclosed assays the present disclosure is fully enabled for identification of compounds for the treatment of the diseases disclosed generically and specifically.

Accordingly this evidence along with the references of Tables 7 10 demonstrate that the parameters measured in the key assays above are associated with and predictive of the specific physiology pathophysiology or medical conditions disclosed herein. The physiology pathophysiology or medical conditions disclosed include generically disclosed conditions and diseases such as but are not limited to unwanted cellular proliferation inflammation mediated diseases hyperproliferative diseases and diseases involving a glycosidase. Specifically disclosed diseases include but are not limited to restenosis vascular occlusive diseases arthritis cancer and the like. Therefore methods of treating diseases disease states or conditions disclosed in the specification or methods of modulating for example the production or uptake of a biologically active chemical are disclosed in such as way as to allow the skilled artisan to make and use the invention the tests provided are predictive of the claimed uses and therefore are fully enabled for all the diseases or conditions encompassed therein.

The compounds of the present invention may be used alone in various combinations with one another and or in combination with other agents along with delivery devices to effectively prevent and treat the diseases described herein though particular applications are found in vascular disease and in particular vascular disease caused by injury and or by transplantation. Though this example focuses on vascular disease provision of the compounds of the present invention with medical devices for treatment of the diseases and conditions capable of being treated with the compounds is contemplated by the present invention.

Various medical treatment devices utilized in the treatment of vascular disease may ultimately induce further complications. For example balloon angioplasty is a procedure utilized to increase blood flow through an artery and is the predominant treatment for coronary vessel stenosis. However the procedure typically causes a certain degree of damage to the vessel wall thereby creating new problems or exacerbating the original problem at a point later in time. Although other procedures and diseases may cause similar injury exemplary aspects of the present invention will be described with respect to the treatment of restenosis and related complications following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and other similar arterial venous procedures including the joining of arteries veins and other fluid carrying conduits in other organs or sites of the body such as the liver lung bladder kidney brain prostate neck and legs.

The local delivery of a compound of the present invention and in some aspects along with other therapeutic agents from a stent prevents vessel recoil and remodeling through the scaffolding action of the stent. The activity of compound provided with or without other therapeutic agents helps determine for which application to treat which disease the coated medical device is being administered. For example compound coated stents can prevent multiple components of neointimal hyperplasia or restenosis as well as reduce inflammation and thrombosis. Local administration of a compound of the present invention and other therapeutic agents to stented coronary arteries may also have additional therapeutic benefit. For example higher tissue concentrations of the compounds of the present invention and other therapeutic agents may be achieved utilizing local delivery rather than systemic administration. In addition reduced systemic toxicity may be achieved utilizing local delivery rather than systemic administration while maintaining higher tissue concentrations. In utilizing local delivery from a stent rather than systemic administration a single procedure may suffice with better patient compliance. An additional benefit of combination therapeutic agent and or compound therapy may be to reduce the dose of each of the therapeutic agents thereby limiting toxicity while still achieving a reduction in restenosis inflammation and thrombosis. Local stent based therapy is therefore a means of improving the therapeutic ratio efficacy toxicity of anti restenosis anti inflammatory and anti thrombotic therapeutic agents.

Although exemplary aspects of the invention will be described with respect to the treatment of restenosis and other related complications it is important to note that the local delivery of a compound of the present invention alone or as part of a therapeutic agent combination may be utilized to treat a wide variety of conditions utilizing any number of medical devices or to enhance the function and or life of the device. For example intraocular lenses placed to restore vision after cataract surgery are often compromised by the formation of a secondary cataract. The latter is often a result of cellular overgrowth on the lens surface and can be potentially minimized by combining one or more compounds of the present invention having activity that is effective in preventing unwanted cellular growth with the device. Other medical devices that often fail due to tissue in growth or accumulation of proteinaceous material in on and around the device such as shunts for hydrocephalus dialysis grafts colostomy bag attachment devices ear drainage tubes leads for pace makers and implantable defibrillators can also benefit from the combinations of the compounds of the present invention possibly other pharmaceutical agents and the devices. Other surgical devices sutures staples anastomosis devices vertebral disks bone pins suture anchors hemostatic barriers clamps screws plates clips vascular implants tissue adhesives and sealants tissue scaffolds various types of dressings bone substitutes intraluminal devices and vascular supports could also provide enhanced patient benefit using this compound device combination approach. Essentially any type of medical device may be coated in some fashion with at least one compound of the present invention alone or as part of a therapeutic agent combination which enhances treatment over the use of the device or therapeutic agent without combination with the compound.

Although any number of stents may be utilized in accordance with the present invention for simplicity a limited number of stents will be described in exemplary aspects of the present invention. The skilled artisan will recognize that any number of stents may be utilized in connection with the present invention. In addition as stated above other medical devices may be utilized. For example though stents are described sleeves outside the vessels are also contemplated as are other medical devices that can provide a substrate for administration for at least one of the compounds of the present invention.

A stent is commonly used as a tubular structure left inside the lumen of a duct to relieve an obstruction. Typically stents are inserted into the lumen in a non expanded form and are then expanded autonomously or with the aid of a second device in situ. A common method of expansion occurs through the use of a catheter mounted angioplasty balloon that is inflated within the stenosed vessel or body passageway in order to shear and disrupt the obstructions associated with the wall components of the vessel and to obtain an enlarged lumen.

A stent may resemble an expandable cylinder and may comprise a fenestrated structure for placement in a blood vessel duct or lumen to hold the vessel duct or lumen open more particularly for protecting a segment of artery from restenosis after angioplasty. The stent may be expanded circumferentially and maintained in an expanded configuration that is circumferentially or radially rigid. The stent may be axially flexible and when flexed at a band for example the stent avoids any externally protruding component parts.

The stent may be fabricated utilizing any number of methods. For example the stent may be fabricated from a hollow or formed stainless steel tube that may be machined using lasers electric discharge milling chemical etching or other means. The stent is inserted into the body and placed at the desired site in an unexpanded form. In one aspect expansion may be effected in a blood vessel by a balloon catheter where the final diameter of the stent is a function of the diameter of the balloon catheter used. It should be appreciated that a stent in accordance with the present invention may be embodied in a shape memory material including for example an appropriate alloy of nickel and titanium or stainless steel.

Structures formed from stainless steel may be made self expanding by configuring the stainless steel in a predetermined manner for example by twisting it into a braided configuration. In this aspect after the stent has been formed it may be compressed so as to occupy a space sufficiently small as to permit its insertion in a blood vessel or other tissue by insertion means wherein the insertion means include a suitable catheter or flexible rod. Upon emerging from the catheter the stent may be configured to expand into the desired configuration where the expansion is automatic or triggered by a change in pressure temperature or electrical stimulation.

Furthermore a stent may be modified to comprise one or more reservoirs. Each of the reservoirs may be opened or closed as desired. These reservoirs may be specifically designed to hold the compound or compound therapeutic agent combination to be delivered. Regardless of the design of the stent it is preferable to have the compound or compound therapeutic agent combination dosage applied with enough specificity and a sufficient concentration to provide an effective dosage in the affected area. In this regard the reservoir size in the bands is preferably sized to adequately apply the compound or compound therapeutic agent combination dosage at the desired location and in the desired amount.

In an alternative aspect the entire inner and outer surface of the stent may be coated with the compound or compound therapeutic agent combination in therapeutic dosage amounts. The coating techniques may vary depending on the compound or compound therapeutic agent combination. Also the coating techniques may vary depending on the material comprising the stent or other intraluminal medical device.

One or more compounds of the present invention and in some instances other therapeutic agents as a combination may be incorporated onto or affixed to the stent in a number of ways. In one aspect the compound is directly incorporated into a polymeric matrix and sprayed onto the outer surface of the stent. The compound elutes from the polymeric matrix over time and enters the surrounding tissue. The compound preferably remains on the stent for at least three days up to approximately six months and more preferably between seven and thirty days.

Any number of non erodible polymers may be utilized in conjunction with the compound and such polymeric compositions are well known in the art. In one aspect the polymeric matrix comprises two layers. The base layer comprises a solution of poly ethylene co vinylacetate and polybutylmethacrylate. The compound is incorporated into this base layer. The outer layer comprises only polybutylmethacrylate and acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent the compound from eluting too quickly. The thickness of the outer layer or topcoat determines the rate at which the compound elutes from the matrix. Essentially the compound elutes from the matrix by diffusion through the polymer matrix. Polymers are permeable thereby allowing solids liquids and gases to escape therefrom. The total thickness of the polymeric matrix is in the range from about one micron to about twenty microns or greater. It is important to note that primer layers and metal surface treatments may be utilized before the polymeric matrix is affixed to the medical device. For example acid cleaning alkaline base cleaning salinization and parylene deposition may be used as part of the overall process described above.

The poly ethylene co vinylacetate polybutylmethacrylate and compound solution may be incorporated into or onto the stent in a number of ways. For example the solution may be sprayed onto the stent or the stent may be dipped into the solution. Other methods include spin coating and plasma polymerization. In one aspect the solution is sprayed onto the stent and then allowed to dry. In another aspect the solution may be electrically charged to one polarity and the stent electrically charged to the opposite polarity. In this manner the solution and stent will be attracted to one another. In using this type of spraying process waste may be reduced and more precise control over the thickness of the coat may be achieved.

Cook Group Incorporated Bloomington Ind. Abbott Labs. Inc. Abbott Park Ill. and Boston Scientific Corp. Natick Mass. . See e.g. U.S. Pat.
