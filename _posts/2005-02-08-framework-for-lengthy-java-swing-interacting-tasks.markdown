The method may include the steps of providing the process. The process and the event dispatch thread executing independent of one another and the process generating a first method call during execution of the process and a final result upon completion of execution, where the first method call includes a partial result generated by the executing process. The method may further include sending the first method call, storing the first method, including coalescing the first method call with an existing method call, retrieving the partial result from the first method call, and outputting the retrieved first method call on the event dispatch thread such that the partial result is displayed to a user.
