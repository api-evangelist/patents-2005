The backs of loose chairs or fixed seating used in group settings such as arenas stadiums convention meeting rooms theaters restaurants and the like are ideal surfaces for attaching informational placards for advertising seat assignment instructions entertainment and the like to an audience that will be present long enough to read and digest the information presented. Since such an audience may also have time on their hands become bored etc the placard must be contained in a reasonably vandal resistant holder and be replaceable at low cost both for refreshing the message and replacing vandalized holders.

Because the seat backs in many installations lean backwards a few degrees a sign on the back should be offset to be at least vertical or preferably slightly upwardly facing to provide a more normal view for reading.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 174 082 by Miles Pelky et al describes a satchel having an open pocket for retaining an advertising panel FIGS. 6 61 and Col 3 L38 51 and a second pocket 42 for slipping over the back of a chair. The overall function and purpose of Mr. Pelky s invention differs from the present invention. The present invention is intended to have a greater permanence and Mr. Pelky s display pocket is totally unprotected from being tampered with as his application needs no such protection.

Mr. Pelky s invention is not intended to remain on the chair after occupation. It is to be removed and used as a carrying case satchel or briefcase like for convention handouts.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 248 536 by Eugene Du Katz is a laminated structure designed for adhesively attaching to a flat surface for relatively long periods of time. It is suitable only for flat surfaces unless special assembly procedures are employed. Even then it is not suitable for compound curved surfaces. Mr Du Katz placard is laminated using adhesives that permit disassembly. Such adhesives may need refreshing prior to re assembly. That would be unwieldy high labor to do in the stands of an arena so re placing the indicia may require removal to a work shop area. Furthermore Mr Du Katz placard is glued to the mounting surface. Again there is the problem of residual glue on the mounting surface and refreshment of the adhesive. Removing any residual glue may require solvents which would be unsatisfactory in the quantity needed for arena seat washing. Furthermore the solvent may attack the paint on the seat. Mr. Du Katz intends his invention to be used on restaurant counter tops and similar places. Solvents might be needed to clean up the residual adhesives but seldom and in small quantities. Also counter tops are usually made of extremely durable non painted surfaces such as Formica glass or ceramics which are resistant to common solvents and gentle scraping.

For arena and stadium use his placard is a ready target for vandalism and may also pick up ugly dirt around the exposed glue at the perimeter.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a holder for a replaceable placard viewable to the person seated behind a chair or seat in a stadium arena or other group setting.

It is another object of the present invention to have the placard as vandal resistant as is practical in view of economic constraints on its construction and installation.

It is another object of the present invention to permit economical changing of the informational placard.

It is another object of the present invention to have alternative embodiments in the details of the construction and use of the disclosed invention also be included within the scope of the claims.

It is another object of the present invention to be capable of holding placards of substantial thickness thereby permitting the use of holographic dual image displays and diffraction displays in which the viewed image changes with the angle of viewing or the quality of ambient lighting.

A placard displaying system comprising a windowed panel with a placard holding part is integrally assembled with a means to affix a placard display to a seat of the kinds commonly found in stadiums arenas and meeting places is disclosed herein. The seat may be either fixed to the floor or portable.

Since some of the intended venues have seats in rows with people seated behind in close proximity the display system must also include reasonable protection from vandalism and be both replaceable and changeable with minimal labor and material costs.

Accordingly the disclosed invention is comprising a bag like sleeve that fits over the back of a seat. One side of the bag has a paned window behind which an informational placard is placed. An internal second panel is secured behind the window thus forming a pocket into which an information containing placard is placed. Other areas of the bag surface including the front and sides may be inscribed with permanent logos art work or information.

One use for the opposite side seat side of the bag from the window is to have a solid color to be used as pixels for large scale decoration. Zones of seating would be fitted with various colors so that from across the arena the seat colors blend to form an image.

A second color of fluorescent paint could be used to cause the image to change under illumination with UV light and or be visible in a darkened arena.

A reflective material could be used to cause the seats to light up on command of the master of ceremonies.

Referring to a sheath or bag like structure is adapted to fit over the back of a chair or arena seat . The back of the sheath is a back panel which has a window opening covered by a placard protecting transparent panel. A panel of clear plastic is preferred but a screen or mesh panel will suffice for use in some venues. A second interior panel is installed behind the window panel. The bottom and sides are closed to form a pocket to receive an informational placard. The pocket panel is shown as extending over almost all of the window. Because the placard will be supported by the seat back the pocket may be much smaller just covering a portion of the lower area of the window. Just enough to keep the placard from shifting or falling out of place.

The bag like sheath is preferably constructed of flexible materials such as cloth flexible plastic or the like.

The areas around the perimeter of the window the side panels and the front side may be emblazoned with permanent inscription.

The chair shown in has a significant thickness Thus a portion of the sheath requires side and top panels which may be distinct parts as illustrated. When the chair back is comprised of thinner material the panels may be merely the small portions of the front and back panels that are turned around the seat back edge. The large panels shown may be separate pieces have separate properties such as being elastic or may also be extensions of the front and back panels.

The embodiment shown in are flat against the seat back. Since many theater and arena seats have tilted back seat backs and are mounted on rising floors the placard inclosed in the present invention will be viewed at an oblique angle which may be significant with some seat designs. show a variation of the present embodiment where the placard holder is a box like bracket structure with an upwardly facing viewing front to overcome the effects of the tilted seat back. Bracket front panel may be hinged along one side to permit opening for access to the placard holding pocket inside. Locking Hold down fasteners secure the placard holding panel to the mounting bracket . The bracket may be fixed to the seat back or may be attached to a hard base panel shaped to conform the curvature of the seat back. It is not necessary that the box be closed on all 6 sides. Spring loading may be included so that the box collapses against the chair back when bumped by people passing along the row of seats.

The display panel is locked in place by one or more locking devices such as a cam lock or threaded fastener having a turning means that is not likely to be operated by whatever tools are likely to be in the pocket of a sports fan especially pocket knives small screwdrivers keys nail clippers and the like. The turning means may be recessed hex Allen head 3 winged recessed drive spline drives or unique 5 or 7 sided recessed heads etc. Recessing blocks access to larger items such as keys and most knife blades. 3 wing drives in particular do not offer purchase to a simple flat blade screwdriver. Hex heads and splines can be turned by a common screwdriver of appropriate dimensions to fit snugly within the recess.

The side panels of may be replaced with hooks or hook like structures attached to the back panel and hooking around onto or into the side edges of the seat. Elastic bands or an elastic back panel would supply the force to keep the hooks in place.

Instead of hooks the placard holding panel may be held in place by loops of cord or fabric over bollards under buttons or screw heads attached to chair sides or even the back of chair wherever they may be unobtrusive to the occupant and others in the venue. These are illustrated in .

The characteristics in common between buttons screws and bollards is that the cord passes around and is held by a shaft and accidental release is prevented by an enlarged head portion.

Loop cords or the fabric of the panel itself are elastic to provide the tension to hold the panel snugly against the seat back.

For chair backs having a significant curvature the seat side of the bag embodiment can be a firm panel curved to fit the seat back. This eliminates the cloth panel stretched across the chord of the seat back arc. Similarly the box embodiment shown in may be attached to a similar hard form fitting back panel.

The hinge described above for the embodiment illustrated in may be replaced by any practical means of removably holding the display panel to the body of the box. Suggested are pins or tabs and co operating holes folded lip over the edge and additional locks of the type already described. The principal advantages of using alternative hinging is possibly lower cost to construct and that the display panel may be removed to a shop for refurbishing such as for fixing damage repainting re logoing or even reloading the message placard holder.

The bag like embodiment shown in is constructed to co operatively fit over the back of a chair. Because the subject chairs are constructed in various dimensions the dimensions of the bag may be customized to fit the target chair. In use the informational placard is placed within the internal pocket and the placard holding bag is slipped over the chair back. To change the placard inside it is usual to remove the bag remove the old placard and insert the new placard then re slip the bag onto the chair. Similarly the box structure of is opened with the cooperating tool and the placard replaced.

The magnetic embodiment of is intended primarily for use on metal seat backs and on machinery etc. Not all venues for gathering have participants with time on their hands or inclination to vandalize the facilities thus a simpler version of the placard holder is a viable optional embodiment.
