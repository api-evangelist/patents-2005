This invention relates in general to improved dielectric resonators wherein the spurious frequency modes are highly subsided.

Microwave filters and dielectric resonator oscillators are widely used in the field of communication electronics especially in microwave telecom systems for Satellite telecom as well as terrestrial links and cellular mobile handsets. Dielectric resonators DRs are key microwave passive components finding wide applications in miniature microwave filters and oscillators for generating resonating frequencies for communication. The resonance mode spectrum of a DR is so dense that the spurious undesirable HE HEor TM01 modes may interfere with the dominant desirable usually TE mode. Thus it is valuable to attenuate the spurious modes for efficient transmission of the dominant desirable mode.

There have been several studies to improve the spurious free response of a DR configuration while providing limited or no influence on the Q factor for the DR.

The mode separation in frequency of the dominant f desirable and the nearest the undesirable mode has been found to be 0.58 ffor a case of a ring DR shielded in a circular metal cavity. The comparative separation however tends to reduce for the DR in MIC configuration to 0.35 to 0.38 f.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 706 052 describes a design of dielectric resonator with TE mode being the primary mode used. The design is provided with a dielectric resonator having a plurality of dielectric resonator units which are combined into one unit by a connecting means with a boundary being formed between adjacent dielectric resonator units. The dielectric resonator units are accommodated in a metallic conductive case with input and output members for electrical connection of said dielectric resonator with an external circuit. The design shifts a resonant frequency of spurious mode into a frequency zone higher than a resonant point by causing said spurious mode to pass through boundary surfaces or layers.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 059 929 provides a design of dielectric resonator which is constructed by piling a plurality of plate shaped dielectrics one on the other under pressure or adhering respective dielectrics with an adhesive to each other so that faces thereof to which pressure is applied or faces thereof adhered to each other are parallel with an electric field in the dominant resonance mode of the dielectric resonator. The dielectric constant in the spaces to which pressure is applied or in the spaces in which the adhesive exists is low making it difficult for an electric field in a resonance mode other than a dominant resonance mode to pass through the spaces between the faces of the dielectrics to which pressure is applied or the faces thereof adhered to each. The spurious response is thus suppressed.

The disadvantages of the resonators of the said patents is that the mode separation changes with the change in the substrate thickness which does not provide versatility for choosing the substrate. Further the mode separation degrades while tuning the device.

Thus there is still no dielectric resonator available in the art which efficiently generates the dominant desirable mode by subsiding the spurious modes. To fulfill this need the present invention provides an improved dielectric resonator which overcomes all the above limitations.

Some inventive aspects described herein discuss an improved design for a configuration resulting in an improved mode separation in microwave integrated circuit MIC environment. The obtained mode separation in some embodiments is the best ever reported for shielded ring DR placed on a substrate. The dominant interested mode is TE and the nearest spurious mode is the TM or the hybrid modes. To get a better mode separation we may influence the resonance frequencies of TM and hybrid modes by influencing their resonance fields respectively. Accordingly when some material from the ring DR is removed as proposed here in the hybrid fields can be influenced more and better spurious free response could be obtained. Some embodiments of the improved DR show no deterioration Q factor of fundamental mode as comparing to a ring DR in MIC environment. Some embodiments give mode separation that is higher over the ring DR even after changing the substrate thickness and the ratio of Q factor of fundamental to nearest mode is also better over ring DR. Some embodiments also exhibit much lower degradation of mode separation than the conventional ring resonator while tuning and offers versatility in choosing the substrate thickness which is limited in a ring resonator.

In still another embodiment of the present invention the 1layer 2layer and 3layer are cylindrical in nature.

In still another embodiment of the present invention the 2layer has a radius smaller than 1and 3layers.

Certain embodiments show an improved design of a dielectric resonator wherein the spurious free response of the proposed dielectric resonator is about 6 better as compared to the conventional devices.

To get a better mode separation we need to influence the resonance frequencies of TM and hybrid modes by influencing their resonance fields respectively. The electric field of TE fundamental mode is basically confined near the perimeter of dielectric resonator but three other modes undesirable HE HEor TM are basically confined at the central region of the DR. By removing the plug from the central region in axial direction we disturb the electric fields of only undesirable modes HE HEor TM and influence the resonant frequencies. The resonant frequency of TE does not change because at the central region of DR there in no electric field due to TE mode.

In the modified ring resonator of some dielectric is removed from the central region of the top and some from the bottom of the ring resonator in axial direction. Thus by influencing the resonance fields of this central region of top layer the hybrid mode fields can be influenced more with lesser influence on the TE mode. Accordingly when some material from the ring DR is removed as proposed here in the hybrid fields can be influenced more.

For the given configurations in the dominant interested mode is TE and the nearest spurious mode is the TM or the hybrid modes.

Thus the structure of comprises three layers and as shown in having a hole in axial direction but only the radius of top and bottom holes are same d and the sandwiched layer having a different hole radius c . The depth p of top and bottom layer is the same as shown in . The resonator dielectric has a radius a and is on substrate having ground plane which encloses the DR. The substrate could be any material with permittivity in the range of 2.2 to 9.3. In one embodiment the permittivity is about 2.2. The material used in the present invention is RT Duride.

A comparative study was done on the dominant and nearest resonance modes as well as their Q factors for the ring resonator of and the modified ring resonator of . The DR characteristic and other structural parameters for the configurations are provided in . The substrate ground plane and the metal enclosure could be of any metal having high conductivity. In some embodiments the metal enclosure is gold plated 4.1 10mhos cm to avoid corrosion. The unloaded Q factor of all three resonator configurations takes into consideration the loss of the ground plane the substrate the dielectric resonator the side of metal enclosure and the top and bottom cover plate. The mode separation between the dominant TE mode and the nearest adjacent hybrid or TM type is defined by the following 

The resonant frequencies and Q factors obtained in the simulations have been used for the analysis of the ring and modified ring structure. The shows the separation of TE with the nearest mode of the modified ring resonator for the various values of the c d ratio for the c a range between 0.3 to 0.5. The chosen c a range is according to the past studies of the ring resonator where the best mode separations have been observed at c a 0.25 to 0.5. Other c a ratios may also be used. It is seen from that for various c a ratios the maximum separation occurs at different c d values. At c d 1 the modified ring resonator of becomes the ring resonator of . Hence in the plot in the maximum separation of the modified ring is being compared with ring resonator c d 1 . The modified ring resonator always shows a better mode separation over the conventional ring resonator with improvement of 6 .

In the MIC environment the thickness of the substrate is an important design issue. Hence the analysis has been carried out for various thickness t of the substrate. The influence of substrate thickness on mode separation for the three configurations is shown in . Substrate thickness is expressed here by t l where t is the thickness of the substrate and l is the height of the dielectric. It is evident that i the mode separations monotonically increase with the thickness of the substrate for all the three configurations and ii the modified ring DR always gives the best mode separation compared to ring DR and circular rod for various t l ratios. shows a simultaneous evaluation of a Q factor for these configurations at the chosen parameters as in . This reveals that the Q factor for TE mode do not degrade for any of the configurations. However a more remarkable observation is about the Q factors of the nearest higher and potentially interfering mode with the dominant modes. Qfor modified ring DR do not vary with substrate thickness but for the ring it undergoes a peak at t l 0.4 while for a rod DR it monotonically increases. This behavior for various substrate thickness implies that the energy filling factor for the interfering modes i increases undesirably for a rod resonator ii needs to be optimized for a ring resonator and iii does not influence the modified ring resonator. This result renders versatility to the modified ring DR configuration in respect to choice of substrate thickness and may be interest in optimized filter designs.

The proposed modified ring resonator provides an improved mode separation to an extent of 6 over a corresponding ring DR configuration in a MIC environment. A further advantage of the proposed modified ring DR is its versatility in respect to substrate thickness for an optimized mode separation design which for a circular rod or ring DR is not available.

A tuning element is an advantageous structure in a DR configuration to compensate the shift in resonance frequencies which appear due to the allowed fabrication tolerances operating temperature variations and also to accommodate for the inevitable errors due to the theoretical predictions. The tunability performance for the various configurations has been examined not alone for the range of resonant frequencies the tuning can provide but also for its influence on the mode separations. This is considered advantageous since a tuning metal screw tends to degrade the spurious free response. The tuning structure for the ring DR and the modified ring DR are presented in . The diameter of tuning screw is kept at Ds a or Ds 2a. Evaluations for the resonant frequencies and Q factors for the TE mode with the gap dimension g were done. The tunability is determined from where the frequency without tuner corresponds to maximum g value.

The tuning range with the larger diameter screw Ds 2a is higher for all the configurations. Significantly for the case of the modified ring DR configuration where a maximum mode separation improvement had been observed the tuning range 6.079 is maintained close to comparative ring DR tuning range 6.335 . This advantageous aspect ensures that mode separation improvement obtained in the proposed modified ring DR is not at the cost of tunability. On considering results of the studies done with respect to tuning effects it was observed that while tuning ranges are generally higher for larger diameter screw the degradation in Q factors is also higher. However the Q factors in general remain higher for the modified ring case over the comparative ring DR configuration and more so when Ds a.

Another important object of this tunability study is regarding the behavior of mode separation with tuning. The plots show that in general the mode separations reduce with tuning for all the configurations though to a lesser extent for the smaller diameter screw Ds a . Further in it may be seen that degradation in mode separation with reducing g or increasing tuning is far lesser for the modified ring DR than a comparative ring DR. The extent of degradation in mode separation for the available tuning range has been determined from these plots using a following definition

Sis maximum mode separation at max value of g without tuning screw and Sis minimum mode separation at min value of available g .

Obviously a smaller Ssignifies a lower degradation and hence a better spurious free response over the tunability range as may be provided in a given configuration. The modified ring DR provides a lesser degradation in mode separation than a comparative ring DR. The degradation is found to be least 0.285 for the modified ring DR configuration for Ds a where tunability is 1.622 . In a comparative ring DR the degradation SD increases twofold 0.56 with only a slightly higher tuning range 2.27 . It may also be noted that a higher tunability range can be obtained though at the cost of higher degradation of mode separation for the case when screw Ds 2a.

The principle used can also be applied for designing alternative designs of the dielectric resonator to provide better spurious free response. shows an arc shaped modified ring resonator and shows a cone shaped modified ring resonator. The following Table 1 shows the mode separations of TE mode with the nearest modes for the ring DR and modified ring DR of arc and cone shapes. For c a 0.40 and k 0.75 and k 0.075. It can be easily seen that the modified ring resonator of the arc and cone types provide better mode separation.

The mode separation obtained for these embodiments is the best ever reported for shielded ring DR placed on a substrate.
