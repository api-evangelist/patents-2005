Other technical advantages of certain embodiments of the present invention include the ability to use existing device hardware or software to play the call indicator and the ability to generate the call indicator based on a variety of different types of caller identifying information. Other technical advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the following figures descriptions and claims. Moreover while specific advantages have been enumerated above various embodiments may include all some or none of the enumerated advantages.

Communication devices may each represent any suitable combination of hardware and or software to provide communication services to users. For example communication devices may represent telephones computers running telephony software video monitors cameras or any other devices that support the communication of voice video text or other suitable forms of data using communication system . In the illustrated embodiment communication devices and represent Internet Protocol IP telephones and communication devices and represent telephony enabled personal computers PCs . Additionally communication device represents a mobile phone coupled to communication system through PSTN . Although illustrates a particular number and configuration of communication devices communication system contemplates any number and or arrangement of such components.

Gateways comprise any suitable combination of hardware and or software for performing translation functions to facilitate seamless communication between PSTN and LANs . These functions may include translation between transmission formats and between communication procedures. In addition gateways may also translate between audio and video CODECs and perform call setup and clearing on both the LAN side and the PSTN side. For example gateway may interface call manager with PSTN . As a result when a call is placed by any of communication devices using PSTN gateway translates the call format associated with PSTN to a call format associated with call manager such as for example SIP or another suitable packet based communication protocol.

Call managers comprise any suitable combination of hardware and or software operable to establish a connection between two or more components such as for example connecting a call between multiple communication devices or between a particular communication device and voicemail server . In a particular embodiment call manager comprises a Voice Over Internet Protocol VoIP server that performs the functions of signaling and session management within a packet telephony network. The signaling functionality of call manager allows call information to be carried across network boundaries. The session management functionality of call manager provides the ability to control the attributes of an end to end call across multiple networks in communication system . In a particular embodiment the VoIP protocol supported by call manager comprises Session Initiation Protocol SIP which is a standard for multimedia conferencing over internet protocol. In this embodiment call managers comprise SIP proxy servers that handle call processing SIP requests and SIP responses. Although the following description of call managers is detailed with respect to SIP it should be understood that call managers may support other IP telephony protocols instead such as the H.323 protocol. In particular embodiments call managers may also provide a number of telephony services for communication devices and other devices located in LAN including but not limited to call forwarding teleconferencing network monitoring and CODEC translation.

Voicemail servers support voicemail services for communication devices . More specifically voicemail servers may each generate voicemails receive voicemails generated by other voicemail servers store received or generated voicemails and or provide users access to stored voicemails. Voicemail servers may include any appropriate combination of hardware and or software suitable to provide the described voicemail functionality.

In particular embodiments voicemail servers each include a processor operable to execute instructions associated with voicemail services and a memory operable to store processor instructions and other appropriate information to be used by voicemail servers during operation. Processor may represent any suitable processing device capable of processing and communicating electronic information including but not limited to application specific integrated circuits ASICs field programmable gate arrays FPGAs digital signal processors DSPs and any other suitable specific or general purpose processors. Memory may represent any collection and arrangement of volatile or non volatile local or remote devices suitable for storing data including but not limited to random access memory RAM devices read only memory ROM devices magnetic storage devices optical storage devices or any other suitable data storage devices.

Additionally particular embodiments of voicemail server may include a voice announce module VA and a text to speech TTS module that perform specialized tasks as described in greater detail below. VA module and TTS module may each represent any appropriate hardware and or software to provide the described tasks. Although shown as separate discrete components within voicemail server VA module and TTS module may represent or include in part or in whole shared components of voicemail server . In particular embodiments VA module and TTS module represent software modules running on processor .

LANs and PSTN provide connectivity between components coupled to them using any appropriate communication protocols. In particular embodiments LANs each represent all or a portion of an Ethernet network connecting the communication devices of a particular entity such as a company or a university campus. Furthermore in particular embodiments PSTN represents all or a portion of the publicly switched telephone network. Although illustrates a particular embodiment of communication system that includes particular types of networks specifically LANs and PSTN coupling particular components of communication system communication system may include any appropriate types and numbers of networks.

In operation a particular voicemail server initiates a communication link with call manager to monitor call signaling messages and or other types of messages that are transmitted to or from one or more of the communication devices supported by call manager . In the example illustrated in voicemail server establishes a communication link with call manager to monitor call signaling messages sent to and from one or more communication devices such as communication device . Communication link may represent any appropriate form of link allowing voicemail server to monitor communication associated with particular communication devices supported by call manager and voicemail server may establish communication link in any suitable manner. In particular embodiments communication link comprises a Computer Telephony Integration CTI link that voicemail server establishes using a Java Telephony Application Programming Interface JTAPI interface .

After establishing communication link with call manager voicemail server may begin monitoring messages received by call manager that are to and or from communication device . In particular voicemail server may register with call manager to be notified of incoming calls to communication device . For example in an embodiment of communication system which supports SIP voicemail server may register to be notified of all SIP invitations sent to communication device . As part of this notification voicemail server may receive any appropriate information associated with each incoming call. In particular embodiments call manager may communicate caller identification information associated with the call. Caller identification information may include any appropriate information that identifies the caller making the incoming call and or the communication device the caller is using including but not limited to the caller s name an Internet Protocol IP address associated with the relevant communication device a phone number for the communication device and or an extension number for the communication device .

Additionally voicemail server may also disable a default ringer of communication device and or other call indicators that communication device may use to indicate to a user that communication device is receiving a call. Voicemail server may disable the default ringer and or other call indicators in any appropriate manner based on the configuration and characteristics of voicemail server and communication device . In a particular embodiment voicemail server disables the default ringer of communication device by transmitting a HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP message to communication device that instructs communication device not to use the default ringer to indicate any subsequent incoming calls. Furthermore voicemail server may configure communication device to receive notifications from voicemail server of incoming calls intended for communication device . Voicemail server may configure communication device in any appropriate manner based on the characteristics of communication device . For example in particular embodiments voicemail server may transmit an HTTP request to communication device that instructs communication device to accept notifications from voicemail server on a particular port of communication device

After registration with call manager and any appropriate configuration of communication device voicemail server begins monitoring communication between communication device and other communication devices . As a result of the voicemail server s registration with call manager call manager notifies voicemail server of incoming calls to communication device by transmitting caller identification information to voicemail server . Thus when another user referred to here as the calling party places a call to the user associated with communication device referred to here as the called party voicemail server receives caller identification information from call manager . Voicemail server may then attempt to match all or a portion of the received caller identification information with any of a plurality of identifier messages stored on or accessible by voicemail server . For example in particular embodiments voicemail server stores a table that includes a user record for one or more users having voicemail accounts that are hosted by voicemail server . Each user record may in particular embodiments include a user identifier such as a name social security number or other suitable identifier for a particular user and or a device identifier such as a phone number extension IP address or other suitable identifier for a communication device associated with that user. Each user record may also include a stored identifier message for the relevant user. Voicemail server may match all or a portion of caller identification information to a particular user record in the table and access the stored identifier message included in the matched user record . This matching process is described in greater detail below with respect to .

Stored identifier messages may represent any suitable audio messages that identify the associated user in any appropriate manner and may be stored in any suitable format. In particular embodiments each stored identifier message comprises a digital recording such as a WAV file of the user stating his or her name. Furthermore in particular embodiments of communication system each user records his or her name as part of the process for initializing their voicemail account. Voicemail server then uses these recordings as part of the greeting that is played to callers when they are forwarded to a particular user s voicemail account. In such embodiments of communication system voicemail server may also use these recordings as stored identifier messages for the user who recorded the message saving time and effort in the initialization process.

When voicemail server subsequently receives caller identification information from call manager voicemail server determines whether caller identification information matches one of the stored identifier messages . If voicemail server determines that caller identification information matches one of the stored identifier messages voicemail server transmits the matched identifier message to communication device along with any appropriate additional information. Voicemail server may also transmit additional audio information to communication device such as an introductory phrase and or tone to be generated by communication device in addition to the identifier message . For example when voicemail server detects an incoming call from a John Doe voicemail server may transmit audio data that includes a beep and the phrase Call from . . . along with John Doe s identifier message so that communication device using its speaker generates a beep followed by the message Call from John Doe. Voicemail server may transmit identifier message to communication device in any appropriate manner based on the configuration and capabilities of voicemail server and communication device . In particular embodiments voicemail server transmits identifier message to a predetermined port of communication device as a Real Time Transport Protocol RTP stream .

When communication device receives stored identifier message communication device may play stored identifier message using a speaker or other suitable interface of communication device to indicate that communication device has received an incoming call. As a result the stored identifier message may serve as an indication to the called party that communication device is receiving an incoming call. Moreover because the stored identifier message provides an audio identification of the calling party the called party may be able determine whether to answer the incoming call and or take any other appropriate actions such as forwarding the call to voicemail without approaching or turning to face communication device . In this regard the use of an identifier may replace a traditional ringing of a telephone.

If voicemail server is unable to match caller identification information with any stored identifier messages voicemail server may instead use TTS module to generate audio data representing artificial speech signals from all or a portion of caller identification information for transmission to communication device . As one example this may occur in particular embodiments for incoming calls received from communication devices external to LAN such as communication devices . Under such circumstances TTS module may generate audio data from any appropriate portion of caller identification information .

For example in particular embodiments TTS module of voicemail server first determines whether a name is included in caller identification information . If so TTS module generates speech data based on the name included in caller identification information . If no name is included in caller identification information TTS module generates audio data based on a telephone number included in caller identification information . Moreover if no name or telephone number are included in caller identification information TTS module generates audio data based on any other appropriate portion of caller identification information . After TTS module generates audio data voicemail server transmits this audio data to communication device in any appropriate manner based on the configuration and capabilities of voicemail server and communication device . In particular embodiments voicemail server transmits the audio data to a predetermined port of communication device as a Real Time Transport Protocol RTP stream in a similar manner to that described above with respect to the stored identifier message . When communication device receives the audio data generated by TTS module communication device may play this audio data using a speaker or other suitable interface of communication device to indicate that communication device has received an incoming call.

Although the description above focuses on an example in which the caller and the called party both utilize communication devices coupled to the same LAN particular embodiments of communication system may be configured to provide the same functionality for calls between communication devices coupled to different LANs or between a communication device couple to a particular LAN and a communication device coupled to PSTN . For example in particular embodiments of communication system voicemail server may be configured to attempt to match caller identification information associated with incoming calls from communication devices that are external to LAN in the same manner as voicemail server does for calls from communication devices coupled to LAN . As one example if LAN connects all of a company s communication devices voicemail server in addition to storing office phone numbers for appropriate users may maintain home phone numbers mobile phone numbers or other external phone numbers for one or more users having voicemail accounts hosted by voicemail server . When communication device receives an incoming call from for example communication device voicemail server may be able to match a telephone number included in the received caller identification information to a stored identifier message associated with a particular user and may transmit the matched stored identifier message to communication device as described above. Additionally voicemail server may transmit additional audio information to communication device indicating that the call is coming from an external number. For example voicemail server may precede stored identifier message by audio data that will generate the phrase External call from . . . when played by communication device

Additionally although the above description illustrates an example in which a particular voicemail server monitors incoming calls to a single communication device voicemail servers may be configured to monitor and process incoming calls to any appropriate number of communication devices at one time. For example a particular voicemail server may be configured to monitor incoming calls for all communication devices coupled to the LAN in which voicemail server is located. Additionally the communication devices that a particular voicemail server monitors may be predetermined and fixed or may be determined dynamically during operation as appropriate based on the configuration and characteristics of communication system .

Thus communication system supports the use of a call indicator that provides useful information about the calling party. Moreover particular embodiments of voicemail server may provide robust functionality capable of generating the call indicator based on whatever information is available in caller identification information . Additionally because this call indicator can be generated based on audio data already recorded for use with voicemail services supported by communication system communication system may limit the amount of time and effort needed to configure voicemail server to provide this call indicator. Furthermore in particular embodiments of communication system the call indicator is played using existing hardware of communication device eliminating the need to add to or modify the hardware in communication system . In this regard communication system provides several benefits. Various embodiments of communication system may exhibit some none or all of these benefits.

If caller identification information matches the device identifier in one of user records as is the case in the example illustrated by voicemail server accesses the stored identifier message in the matched user record . Voicemail server may then transmit the relevant stored identifier message to communication device in an appropriate manner based on the configuration and capabilities of voicemail server and communication device

In the example shown in voicemail server matches a phone number in caller identification information to the device identifier in user record . As a result voicemail server accesses the stored identifier message stored in user record . Voicemail server then transmits stored identifier message to communication device . In the illustrated example voicemail server packetizes audio data in stored identifier message and transmits the packetized audio data to communication device as part of an RTP stream .

If instead caller identification information does not match the device identifier in any of the user records stored in table as is the case in the example illustrated by voicemail server generates audio data based on caller identification information using TTS module . As noted above with respect to TTS module may generate audio data based on any appropriate portion of caller identification information . Voicemail server may then transmit the audio data to communication device in an appropriate manner based on the configuration and capabilities of voicemail server and communication device

In the example shown in the phone number received as part of caller identification information does not match the device identifier in any of user records . As a result TTS module generates audio data based on an appropriate portion of caller identification information . In the illustrated example TTS module generates speech data based on a caller name included in caller identification information . Thus audio data represents data describing speech signals generated by TTS module from the text Henry Adams. Voicemail server then transmits audio data to communication device . In the illustrated example voicemail server packetizes audio data and transmits the packetized audio data to communication device as part of an RTP stream .

The described operation begins at step where voicemail server initiates a communication link with call manager to monitor call signaling messages and or other types of messages that are transmitted to or from one or more of the communication devices supported by call manager . In particular embodiments communication link comprises a Computer Telephony Integration CTI link that voicemail server establishes using a Java Telephony Application Programming Interface JTAPI interface . After establishing communication link voicemail server at step registers with call manager to be notified of incoming calls to the called communication device . For example voicemail server may register to be notified of all SIP invitations sent to the called communication device .

Voicemail server disables a default ringer of the called communication device at step . In particular embodiments voicemail server may disable the default ringer by transmitting an HTTP message to the called communication device that instructs the called communication device to deactivate the default ringer and that specifies a port of the called communication device on which voicemail server will transmit call indicator information to the called communication device . After any appropriate configuration of the called communication device voicemail server monitors messages received by call manager that are transmitted to and from the called communication device at step .

At step voicemail server receives notification from call manager that call manger has received a SIP invite for the called communication device . The notification may include caller identification information . Moreover caller identification information may include a name of the caller a phone number for the caller and or any other appropriate information about the caller. Voicemail server determines whether the caller identification information matches any of a plurality of stored identifiers maintained by voicemail server at step . In doing so voicemail server may attempt to match caller identification information to a user identifier a device identifier and or any other appropriate identifier included in a particular user record based on the configuration of voicemail server and the contents of caller identification information .

If voicemail server determines that caller identification information matches one of the stored identifiers voicemail server transmits a stored identifier message associated with the matched stored identifier to the called communication device at step . In particular embodiments voicemail server transmits the associated stored identifier message to a predetermined port of the called communication device as Real Time Transport Protocol RTP stream . Voicemail server may also transmit additional audio information to the called communication device such as an introductory phrase and or tone to be generated by the called communication device in addition to the stored identifier message . When the called communication device receives the selected stored identifier message the called communication device may play this audio data using a speaker or other suitable interface of the called communication device to indicate that the called communication device has received an incoming call.

If voicemail server is unable to match caller identification information with any stored identifier messages as determined at step execution proceeds to step where voicemail server determines whether caller identification information includes a caller name. If so voicemail server generates using TTS module audio data based on the caller name at step . If voicemail server determines no caller name is included in caller identification information voicemail server generates using TTS module audio data based on a telephone number included in caller identification information at step . After generating audio data voicemail server transmits this audio data to the called communication device at step . In particular embodiments voicemail server transmits the audio data to a predetermined port of the called communication device as RTP stream . When the called communication device receives audio data generated by TTS module the called communication device may play this audio data using a speaker or other suitable interface of the called communication device to indicate that the called communication device has received an incoming call.

Although the present invention has been described with several embodiments a myriad of changes variations alterations transformations and modifications may be suggested to one skilled in the art and it is intended that the present invention encompass such changes variations alterations transformations and modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims.
