The present invention relates to vibrating beam force transducers and in particular to micro machined vibrating beam force transducers.

Vibrating beam force transducers are used as force sensing elements in sensor instruments such as accelerometers and pressure sensors. It is often advantageous to design these sensors using two vibrating beam transducers such that the quantity being sensed e.g. acceleration or pressure forces one transducer in tension and the other in compression. The purpose of this arrangement is to reduce errors by canceling common mode errors such as even order nonlinearities bias temperature sensitivity clock sensitivity bias aging drift and pressure sensitivity. However this method of error cancellation is only effective to the extent that the two force sensing elements experience the same force loading by the quantity being sensed. If the two force sensing elements do not share equal and opposite force loading then sensor accuracy is compromised.

A common method of accomplishing this in force transducer systems is a push pull arrangement in which the force sensing elements are subjected to forces in opposite directions. However problems arise when the push pull arrangement is implemented in a physical device. For example to utilize push pull force sensing elements in a pendulous accelerometer two force sensing elements are both connected to a common proof mass. The force sensing elements typically extend either perpendicular to or parallel to the pendulous axis of the accelerometer. However in such a configuration any thermal expansion mismatch between the support proof mass assembly and the force sensing elements creates thermal strains that in turn create large common mode error signals that can only be partially suppressed by signal processing techniques. As a result the force sensing elements should be physically matched in all sensitivities in order to provide a high level of common mode rejection. This close matching is often difficult to achieve.

Therefore devices and methods for overcoming these and other limitations of typical state of the art sensor instruments are desirable.

The present invention is an apparatus and method for monolithic force transducers in which a sensed force is applied across only two ends of a pair of force sensing elements so that the pair of force sensing elements are loaded in series with one in compression and the other in tension whereby the force sensed by each of the two force sensing elements are identically equal in magnitude but opposite in sense. The series loading of the pair of force sensing elements results in substantially complete error cancellation for the sensor output.

Each of the two vibrating beam transducers within the monolithic transducer can be any of the general variety of vibrating beam transducers available in the prior art. For example the vibrating beam transducers may be dual vibrating beams or single vibrating beam or single vibrating beams with dynamic isolation to name three common varieties.

According to one aspect of the invention the monolithic force transducer is fabricated is using either single crystal quartz or single crystal silicon. Fabrication using single crystal quartz permits use of metal electrodes on the beams for driving the vibrating beams and sensing the vibration.

In the Figures like numerals indicate like elements. Axes are shown having directional arrow heads only for clarity of the description and no limitation is intended thereby.

The Figures illustrate the method of the present invention for a monolithic force transducer capable of being attached between different first and second sensor structures. The architecture of the monolithic force transducer of the present invention includes a unitary body formed from a crystalline substrate the unitary body having first and second mounting elements for mounting the force transducer to the first and second sensor structures respectively. First and second force sensing elements are formed with each of the force sensing elements having first and second ends each force sensing element being sensitive along a common force sensing axis to a force exerted thereto in either direction. A coupling frame is structured for interconnecting the mounting elements and force sensing elements such that the first force sensing element has only its first end connected to the first mounting element and its second end connected to the second end of the second force sensing element and such that the second force sensing element has only its first end connected to the second mounting element and its second end connected to the second end of the first sensing element whereby a force exerted on the monolithic force transducer by the first and second sensor structures along the common force sensing axis results in a compression force in one force sensing element and a tension force in the other force sensing element.

Furthermore in contrast prior art devices the architecture of the monolithic force transducer causes only the first ends of the respective first and second force sensing elements to be connected to the first and second sensor structures through respective first and second mounting elements. Therefore the architecture of the monolithic force transducer has only two ends across which the force is applied and the two force sensing elements that make up the monolithic transducer are loaded in series whereby the force sensed by each of the two force sensing elements are identically equal in magnitude but opposite in sense which results in substantially complete error cancellation for the sensor output.

Force sensing element includes first end and second end with a first force sensing axis extending from second end to first end . Force sensing element similarly includes first end and second end with a second force sensing axis extending from second end to first end . The respective force sensing axes are parallel and linearly aligned substantially coincident with one another and with transducer axis whereby transducer axis defines a common force sensing axis of the monolithic force transducer . For both force sensing elements their respective first ends lie closer to mounting element and their second ends lie closer to mounting element . Thus respective force sensing axes and also point in the same direction along the common transducer axis .

With the above nomenclature the present invention can be described as one in which different connectors interconnect the force sensing elements with the mounting elements such that force sensing element has its first end connected to mounting element and its second end connected to mounting element only through force sensing element and such that force sensing element has its first end connected to mounting element and its second end connected to mounting element only through force sensing element . A component of force F exerted on mounting element is therefore coupled to first end of force sensing element and to second end of force sensing element only through force sensing element . Similarly an opposite component of force F exerted on mounting element is coupled to first end of force sensing element and to second end of force sensing element only through force sensing element . As a result of this coupling scheme any force F either tension or compression exerted between mounting elements and along the common force sensing axis generates a compression force in one force sensing element and a tension force in the other force sensing element.

Furthermore only first ends and of respective force sensing elements and are connected to the sensor structures through respective mounting elements . Therefore the architecture of the monolithic force transducer has only two ends across which any force F is exerted and the two force sensing elements that make up the monolithic transducer are loaded in series whereby the force F sensed by each of the two force sensing elements are identically equal in magnitude but opposite in sense which results in substantially complete error cancellation for the sensor output.

The force sensing elements are illustrated as being of the dual vibrating beam type although other types of force transducers such as single vibrating beam transducers single vibrating beams with dynamic isolation surface acoustic wave transducers and piezoresistive strain gauges may be substituted without deviating from the scope and intent of the invention. Force sensing element is connected to mounting element and has a first end a second end and a pair of elongated beams extending between ends and when configured as the dual vibrating beam type as illustrated. Only first end of force sensing element is connected to mounting element . Force sensing element is connected to mounting element and has a first end a second end and a pair of elongated beams connected between ends and when configured as the dual vibrating beam type as illustrated. Only first end of force sensing element is connected to mounting element . The respective beams thus lie along respective force sensing axes of force sensing element which beams are linearly aligned along and substantially coincident with force sensing axis of the monolithic force transducer .

Respective second ends of force sensing elements are connected only to frame that extends therebetween along transducer axis . Frame is connected only to respective second ends of force sensing elements exclusive of first ends .

By example and without limitation frame includes a pair of lengthwise arms that extend on either side of force sensing element parallel with common force sensing axis and a pair of integral crosswise arms that interconnect the pair of lengthwise arms on either end of force sensing element . Crosswise arms are connected only to respective second ends of force sensing elements . Lengthwise arms and crosswise arms of frame are configured longer and wider respectively than force sensing element whereby frame forms a closed rectangle that entirely surrounds and encompasses both force sensing element and mounting element connected to first end thereof. Mounting elements and are attached to sensor structures and respectively such that the monolithic force transducer provides a measurement of the tension or compression force F coupled thereto by these structures.

Force transducer frame is formed in combination with force sensing elements and mounting elements as an integral and unitary structure rather than an assembly of initially separate parts. For example frame may be formed in combination with force sensing elements and mounting elements by etching a substrate of either single crystal quartz or single crystal silicon. Single crystal quartz permits use of metal electrodes on the beams not shown for driving the vibrating beams and sensing the vibration. Accordingly force sensing elements are formed from closely spaced positions in a common material producing a pair of force sensing elements having closely matched sensitivities. This close matching of sensitivities provides good common mode rejection of errors when conventional means are used for combining the force sensing element outputs.

Furthermore only first ends and of respective force sensing elements and are connected to the sensor structures through respective mounting elements . Therefore the architecture of the monolithic force transducer has only two ends and across which any force F is exerted such that the two force sensing elements are loaded in series whereby the force F sensed by each of force sensing elements are identically equal in magnitude but opposite in sense which results in substantially complete error cancellation for the sensor output.

Again only first end of force sensing element is connected to mounting element and only first end of force sensing element is a connected to mounting element . Another frame includes at least one lengthwise arm extended along side force sensing element and being connected between first end of force sensing element and second mounting element .

Respective second ends of force sensing elements are connected only to frame that extends therebetween in parallel orientation with transducer axis . By example and without limitation alternative frame includes at least one lengthwise arm extended along side force sensing element and at least one crosswise arm integral therewith and positioned adjacent to first end of force sensing element . The lengthwise arm is connected to second end of force sensing element and crosswise arm is connected to second end of force sensing element such that first part of alternative frame interconnects respective second ends of force sensing elements exclusive of respective first ends .

Lengthwise arms and of respective frames optionally extend parallel with common force sensing axis on opposite sides of force sensing element . Thus frames combine to form a partial rectangle that substantially surrounds and nearly encompasses force sensing element but excludes mounting element connected to first end thereof.

Mounting elements and are attached to sensor structures and respectively such that the monolithic force transducer provides a measurement of the tension or compression force F coupled thereto by these structures.

Again only first end of force sensing element is connected to mounting element and only first end of force sensing element is a connected to mounting element .

Respective second ends of force sensing elements are only connected to frame that extends therebetween crosswise and substantially perpendicular to transducer axis . By example and without limitation alternative frame includes a single lengthwise arm that is connected only between respective second ends of force sensing elements crosswise and substantially perpendicular to common force sensing axis exclusive of first ends . According to the alternative frame single lengthwise arm includes outriggers that extend from opposite ends thereof crosswise of both force sensing elements and and there beyond.
