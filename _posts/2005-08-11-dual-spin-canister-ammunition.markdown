This application claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. provisional patent application 60 522201 filed on Aug. 31 2004 which application is hereby incorporated by reference.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to gun launched ammunition and in particular to gun launched canister ammunition.

Antipersonnel canister cartridges have been produced for 105 mm caliber and other gun calibers since cannons came into use. The basic principle of antipersonnel canister cartridges is the expulsion of a large number of lethal fragments flechettes or other geometric shape objects. The various objects are accelerated during gun launch or during a detonation of an explosive charge to achieve a lethal velocity or the kinetic energy needed to accomplish suppression of troops targets or material obstacles. Typically a distinction is made between antipersonnel cartridges which implement an explosive fuze for dispersion and canister cartridges that spread via mechanical aerodynamic or inertial forces.

Several types of canister no fuze projectiles have been developed. These canister projectiles employ a cup type design to carry the lethal mechanisms during the cannon launch. This concept has been employed for a number of years in shotgun ammunition 90 mm ammunition and more recently in 120 mm smooth bore ammunition. Upon exit of the gun the lethal mechanisms are dispersed by the resultant gun forces and acted upon by aerodynamic forces so as to disperse the sub projectiles in a pattern. The sub projectiles then travel ballistically until impact with the target of interest.

An important aspect of canister cartridge performance is to deploy the lethal mechanisms in a desired pattern while assuring a density of sub projectiles that produce the desired end effect. U.S. Pat. No. 6 701 848 discloses a 105 mm canister cartridge that disperses a payload of sub projectiles via gun launch and aerodynamic forces. However the single dispersion cone angle that is produced does not provide sufficient density across all required ranges to fulfill the current lethality need. The present invention is a dual spin projectile that improves sub projectile density across required ranges.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The present invention arose in response to an Army need for a canister projectile that can defeat a 10 man dismounted infantry squad arranged in a V formation between the ranges of 100 meters and 300 meters. The 10 man squad is illustrated in . In each man is represented by a circle. The distance A between each man along the V is about five meters. In response to the Army need the invention was designed to provide the user with an anti personnel and or anti material capability for a range of 2 meters through 500 meters in rifled 105 mm M68 cannons. The invention can also be used with a host of other rifled cannons of various calibers.

The new 105 mm canister projectile utilizes dual spin rates to disperse the lethal payload into two cone angles as shown in . The dual spin feature provides a sufficiently lethal payload density and dispersion across a much larger range than a single spin design with one cone angle. The dual spin feature wherein the forward body decouples from the aft body is transferable to other calibers and projectile designs. is a perspective view of a gun fired ammunition round . Round includes a canister projectile and a propellant filled cartridge .

The base functions as a pusher plate to support the projectile as it travels down the cannon barrel. In the embodiment of base is made of aluminum. Aluminum was selected for weight reduction and cheaper manufacturing cost. The base is anodized to protect against gun gases and possible engraving. The aluminum base provides support for the obturator .

The obturator comprises a nylon band that provides a gas seal between the gun tube wall and the projectile as it travels down the tube. The obturator engages the rifling and transmits some torque to the base of the projectile which is transferred into projectile spin. The primary purpose of the obturator is to provide a gas seal. It is not intended to transmit torque to the projectile body or to spin the entire projectile even though a limited amount of torque is transmitted.

The nylon body is generally tubular and is important to the dual spin concept. The nylon body contains the aft payload that achieves Cone Angle . Nylon plastic was chosen as the body material because it possesses material properties that allow the sub caliber diameter body to bulge engrave to a super caliber diameter and then shatter at muzzle exit to release the enclosed payload with minimal interference. The rifling engagement or engraving allows the nylon body to transmit torque from the rifling and enables the body to attain a high spin rate. The interior diameter of the nylon body is directly proportional to the dispersion achieved at muzzle exit. This interior diameter can be tuned or adjusted to meet the specific pattern diameter required at the desired range. The plastic rear body also helps in the reduction of gun tube wear from repeated firings.

The forward snap joint interfaces the nylon body with the aluminum can . This joint is essential to achieve the dual spin rate function. The overlapping joint has an interference fit that holds the nylon body and can concentric and tight. This joint is inexpensive to machine and easy to assemble. The low coefficient of friction between the nylon and aluminum materials prevents torque transfer from the aft body and the obturator thus allowing the can to attain a low spin rate.

The can carries the forward payload that creates dispersion Cone Angle . The can is constructed of aluminum for various reasons that include inexpensive manufacturing costs reduced weight and material properties that permit the desired opening characteristics. The aluminum can has scoring on the outside surfaces. While the scoring on can may include many variations a preferred scoring allows the can to break into four consistent pieces or petals to release the payload . At muzzle exit the can splits along the score marks. is an exterior view of a can showing an example of the scoring thereon.

In the example of the scoring includes four longitudinal scores along the projectile axis and four separate circumferential scores that combine to create four T shaped scores on the exterior of the can . At the intersection of the vertical and circumferential scores a hole is drilled part way through the wall thickness to prevent the propagating cracks that create the petals from splitting the base of the can. This configuration leaves a plastic hinge of material between the T scores that on discard will be the pivot point prior to the petal breaking off completely from the can.

 Plastic hinge describes the dynamic motion of the petal as it bends open. The metal is highly stressed and experiences plastic yielding or permanent deformation before it eventually breaks off. Since the petal pivots on this location it is referred to as a plastic hinge. Prior to breaking off the hinged petals also serve to slow down the can while the payload is free to continue moving down range. The can is also anodized to create a hard exterior surface that will prevent the can from engaging the rifling engraving .

The aft snap joint interfaces the base with the nylon body . The aft snap joint closely resembles the forward snap joint however the function is quite different. The aft snap joint is intended to provide some slip between the body and base during torque application. The base begins to torque via the obturator when the projectile begins to move down the gun barrel whereas the nylon body begins to engrave and torque at a later point down the barrel. This timing difference can cause a large torque gradient between the base and body that can shear certain joints such as a threaded joint. The slip provided by the aft snap joint provides compliance between the base and body until they achieve the same spin rate and torque levels. In addition the snap joint provides a lap joint overlap interface as oppose to a butt joint interface that creates a better gas seal. The snap joint also provides the same cost reduction and ease of assembly features as the forward snap joint .

The aft payload contains for example metal spheres of uniform or mixed diameters. Preferably the spheres comprise tungsten. The aft payload attains a high spin rate and disperses Cone Angle . The payload can be potted or encased in epoxy or rubber of various types. This directly affects how the load is transferred to the nylon body during gun launch. Potting the payload creates more of a column load versus non potted payload that typically resembles a hydrostatic load condition. A balance is required to ensure enough load is transferred to engrave the nylon body at all temperature extremes while limiting the load enough to prevent damage to the gun. The arrangement of the payload in a mixed size or shape configuration directly correlates to the down range pattern. In other words placing a specific payload type or size in the center of the body prior to firing will result in that payload maintaining that position within the pattern after firing.

The bulkhead is made of nylon and is intended to provide a buffer between the aft payload and the can . This buffer ensures that a consistent friction coefficient is maintained between the nylon body and can thus ensuring repeatable decoupling of the forward and aft bodies.

The forward payload comprises for example spheres enclosed within the can . Preferably spheres comprise tungsten. Since the can and payload attain a low spin rate the forward payload is dispersed into Cone Angle . The primary mechanism for this spreading is aerodynamic forces.

The cap contains the payload within the can . The cap is made of aluminum and is designed to breakup during maximum gun launch forces while traveling down the cannon. is a top view of a cap showing the scoring thereon. While the scoring on cap may include many variations shows the cap scored with V shaped grooves radially from the center. Anywhere from four to eight grooves are used to break the cap into small pie shaped wedges to prevent the cap from interfering with ball dispersion on muzzle exit.

The cartridge is loaded into the cannon and the propellant charge is initiated. When gas pressure builds significantly the projectile moves forward and the obturator is forced into the rifling. Subsequently the obturator is engraved and begins to transfer torque to the base and body . The aft snap joint begins to slip. After traveling approximately 20 of the length of an M68 gun tube the peak gun launch forces compress the nylon body between the base and can . The aft payload applies outward pressure that causes the nylon body to engage the rifling and begin to engrave. Torque is then transferred into the nylon body causing the body and base to achieve a high spin rate.

The can does not engrave on the rifling. When the body begins to achieve a high spin rate minimal torque is capable of being transferred via the forward snap joint therefore the can and forward payload attain a very low spin rate. In addition at peak gun compressive loads the forward payload forces outward on the can walls causing the longitudinal scores to develop cracks.

At muzzle exit the body and base have now reached a full spin rate of up to 550 Hz and the can has reached a low spin rate of 0 30 Hz. Cracks propagate along the scoring in the can creating four symmetric petals that bend on the plastic hinge and eventually break off and discard outward allowing the balls to release and form Cone Angle . Prior to breaking off the hinged petals also serve to slow down the can while the payload is free to continue moving down range. The body exits the gun and due to the engraving process has a number of external grooves formed thereon.

For example if the projectile is launched from an M68 cannon the body will exit the gun with twenty eight grooves formed thereon. These grooves in conjunction with the high compressive state due to the inertial and front stage loads the low material strength of nylon and high centripetal load of the balls pushing outward shatter the nylon body and allow the aft payload to disperse into Cone Angle . The nylon body breaks up into enough small pieces so that the aft payload forms a symmetrical pattern without interference from the discarding parts of the projectile body .

Base is similar to base except that the connection between base and body is a rigid connection that does not allow relative rotation between the base and body rather than a snap joint that allows relative rotation. Threaded connection allows one to load the payload from the bottom of the projectile . Base preferably comprises aluminum. The body functions similar to the body of the first embodiment. However nylon body is preferably machined from bar stock to incorporate an integral forward bulkhead and the variation in the internal diameter.

Snap joint functions similar to snap joint except snap joint has a steel to nylon friction coefficient rather than an aluminum to nylon friction coefficient. The can is made of steel whereas the can is made of aluminum. Steel can carries the forward payload that creates dispersion Cone Angle . Because steel has a very high strength compared to aluminum the can includes slots cut all the way through as opposed to scores partial depth cuts . The design of the slots on can mimics the scoring on can i.e. four longitudinal slots along the projectile axis and four separate circumferential slots that combine to create four T shaped slots on the exterior of the can . The slots on can allow it to break into four consistent pieces or petals to release the payload . At muzzle exit the aerodynamic forces cause the petals to bend backward and open like a flower. This configuration leaves a plastic hinge of material between the T slots that on discard will be the pivot point prior to the petal breaking off completely from the can . The high hardness of steel prevents the petals from engraving.

A can having an open forward end is connected to the bulkhead with at least one shear bolt . Of course more than one shear bolt may be used. Shear bolts are designed to break at a predetermined torque load. The can includes holes therein for receiving the shear bolts . The shear bolts transfer torque from the bulkhead to the can until the torque load shears the bolts . By adjusting the shear strength and or quantity of the bolts used the desired torque and therefore the desired spin rate can be transferred to the can . In this way the can achieves a controlled spin rate between low spin and full spin.

An aft payload is disposed in the body and a forward payload is disposed in the can . A cap is connected to the can and closes the open forward end of the can . Cap includes external threads that engage internal threads in the forward end of can . The base comprises aluminum the body comprises nylon the bulkhead comprises aluminum and the can comprises steel. An exterior surface of the can includes slots formed therein to facilitate breakup of the can .

The base comprises nylon and serves a pusher plate for the can . The base includes an integrated obturator . The can is made of steel and contains the single payload . Slots achieve the same function and opening characteristics as described with regard to other embodiments. The snap joint transfers enough torque for can to attain low spin. On muzzle exit a single dispersion with Cone Angle is achieved.

A can has an open forward end and is connected to the body with a second lap joint . The second lap joint allows relative rotation between the body and the can . Lap joint provides radial support between the body and the can . Lap joint functions similarly to snap joint in . However the lap joint has a reduced joint stress and a larger nylon cross section for greater strength. An obturator is disposed on the base .

A bolt is fixed in a central opening in the base and extends through a central opening in the can . A washer and nut on the end of the bolt hold the base to the can while allowing the bolt and base to rotate relative to the can . The bolt is more robust compared to the snap joints of . Bolt helps relieve the axial load on the body especially in extreme temperatures. An aft payload is disposed in the body and a forward payload is disposed in the can . A cap is connected to the can and closes the open forward end of the can .

A bulkhead is disposed between the aft payload and the can . The bolt passes through a central opening in the bulkhead . The base comprises aluminum the body comprises nylon the bulkhead comprises nylon and the can comprises aluminum. As shown in the exterior surface of the can includes scoring thereon to facilitate breakup of the can.
