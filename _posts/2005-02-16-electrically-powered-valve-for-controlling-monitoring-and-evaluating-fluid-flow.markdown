title: Electrically powered valve for controlling, monitoring and evaluating fluid flow
abstract: Controlled flow of liquid is conducted between aligned inlet and outlet pipe sections through a valve housing within which a solid valve element is sealed and supported for electrically powered displacement between a fully open position establishing unrestricted flow and a fully closed position blocking inflow from the inlet pipe section and outflow from the outlet pipe section. The valve element is operatively displaced either by rotation or by linear movement under electrically powered control through a valve stem connected thereto, while a manual actuator is also connected to the valve stem outside of the valve housing for imparting reduced dithering displacement to the valve element so as to insure that it is in proper and readied working condition. Such electrically powered operational displacement of the valve element is sensed in response to movement of the valve stem.

The present invention relates generally to a valve assembly constructed and arranged to facilitate control monitoring and evaluation of fluid flow between pipe sections.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

There are valve installations located on board sea vessels associated for example with fuel storage systems involving a large number of valves. Because of problems that repeatedly arise with respect to the operation and readiness status of such valves and the inability of monitoring systems such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 176 247B1 6 189 520B1 6 199 629B1 6 227 223B1 and 6 592 099B2 to continuously evaluate and provide data on valve operational malfunctions time consuming valve inspection and testing by personnel becomes necessary. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide an advantageous arrangement for such valves so as to facilitate operational monitoring thereof and reduce the personnel problems heretofore associated therewith.

Pursuant to the present invention certain operational arrangements are prescribed for electrically powered valves to facilitate continuous monitoring and operational evaluation thereof for immediate detection of malfunctioning so that corrective measures may be promptly taken. Toward that end each of the valve arrangements involves a valve housing through which fluid flow is conducted between aligned inlet and outlet pipe sections. A solid valve element is sealed and guidingly supported within the valve housing for electrically powered displacement between a fully open position accommodating unrestricted fluid flow between the inlet and outlet pipe section and a fully closed position blocking outflow through the outlet pipe section. Such displacement of the valve element is effected under electrically powered drive means and sensed through a valve stem having a displacement axis extending therethrough in perpendicular intersecting relation to flow through the valve housing between the inlet and outlet pipe sections. A manual override actuator is connected to the valve stem outside of the valve housing for imparting dithering displacement to the valve element by a reduced extent so as to ensure the valve is in an operational readiness condition.

According to one embodiment of the present invention the valve element is of a spherical ball shape type guidingly mounted within the valve housing for rotation about the displacement axis. A flow passage is formed within the valve element for positioning thereof only in the fully open position to unrestrictively conduct the fluid flow between the inlet and outlet pipe sections. According to another embodiment the valve element is displaced along the stem axis to the fully closed position by electrical energy applied to an electromagnetic drive coil positioned on the valve stem. In such fully closed position the valve element is seated on a surface formed within the valve housing to thereby block fluid flow between the inlet and outlet pipe sections.

Referring now to the drawing in detail and A illustrate one embodiment of a fluid flow controlling valve assembly located within a sea vessel for example in association with a diagrammatically illustrated electrically powered system through which the valve assembly controls flow of fluid such as seawater between inlet and outlet pipe sections and positioned in axial alignment with each other. The pipe sections and extend into and out of a valve housing of the valve assembly . A flow through passageway is formed within a spherical shaped ball valve element positioned in a fully open position within the valve housing as shown in . The valve passageway is 20 cross sectionally larger than the aligned passageways in the pipe sections and to avoid any flow restriction therebetween. The ball valve element is rotatably mounted by a pivot formation within the housing in axial alignment with a valve stem fixed to the ball valve element so as to accommodate its maximized angular displacement by rotation about an axis perpendicular to the passageway . The passageway is positioned by the valve element in a fully open position as shown in and in a fully closed position as shown in blocking inflow and outflow through the pipe sections and . Furthermore the ball valve element is manually displaced about the axis by a reduced dithering amount such as one to five degrees by an override actuator fixed to the valve stem closely spaced above the valve housing whereby dithering displacement ensures when required that the valve assembly and the powered valve operating system are in proper working order.

As diagrammed in the valve stem is connected to an electric motor associated with the system under control of a controller through a motor driver connected to an electrical power source . The valve stem is also operatively connected through a magnetic position sensor to a valve position indicator . Powered drive of the valve assembly by the motor may be interrupted by a declutching device when negative operational evaluation is indicated as reflected by signal detection from the position indicator . Regulation over powered valve operation is established by operational interconnection of a motor current monitor and a limit switch between the valve position indicator and the controller . An audible or visual maintenance alarm device is connected to the controller so as to signify malfunction reflected either by no valve displacement or valve motion deterrence signified by an increase in current.

According to another embodiment of the present invention as shown in the aligned inlet and outlet pipe sections and extend into a valve housing associated with a valve assembly with which an electrically powered system is associated. The inlet and outlet pipe sections and extend through a conduit section of the valve housing at the base of the housing. The valve housing also includes a primary chamber and a secondary chamber . The primary and secondary chambers are separated by an elongated chamber wall . As shown in the elongated chamber wall includes an opening . The valve assembly features angularly related inflow and outflow passages and formed within the housing into which the pipe sections and respectively project in alignment with each other. A valve seat is internally formed within the housing in the conduit section to which the inflow passage from the pipe section extends at a lower end on one lateral side of the housing . The outflow passage extends from the valve seat on the other lateral side spaced above the inflow passage . A solid valve element is positioned within an opening in the conduit section of the housing above the valve seat . A valve stem extends upwardly from the valve element into an enclosure fixed to housing within which powered valve actuating means is enclosed including an electromagnetic valve driving coil positioned on the valve stem . The enclosure includes both the primary chamber and the secondary chamber and as show in the valve stem and the valve driving coil are located within the primary chamber. As shown the valve stem is elongated in a direction that is substantially parallel to the direction of elongation of the chamber wall . A manual override actuator is connected to the upper end of the valve stem outside of the enclosure for use as hereinbefore pointed out with respect to the override actuator .

With continued reference to the powered actuator drive coil is connected to a magnetic actuator sealingly embedded within the enclosure in the secondary chamber. The drive coil is connected by the magnetic actuator to an external electric power source as another component of the electrically powered system through which valve operation is monitored and evaluated as hereinbefore pointed out with respect to the system . A sensor within the enclosure detects vertical movement of the valve element and the valve stem along its drive axis by means of an arm extending laterally therefrom into the sensor which is connected to the actuator . As shown in the sensor arm extends from the primary chamber into the secondary chamber via the opening . A current monitor outside of the enclosure is connected to the actuator so as operate a valve position indicator and an audible or visual alarm device in response to detection of operational malfunction.

In the valve element is shown in a fully open position while in and the valve element is shown in a fully closed position blocking flow between the inflow and outflow passages and .

Obviously other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
