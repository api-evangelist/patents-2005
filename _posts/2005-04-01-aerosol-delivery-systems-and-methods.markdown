title: Aerosol delivery systems and methods
abstract: Methods and systems for aerosol delivery of agents to a patient are described herein. The present system can be used to administer various types of agents, such as a vaccine or other types of pharmaceutical substances. Certain embodiments of the present system utilize an actuator coupled to a disposable aerosolizing element that aerosolizes an agent for delivery to a patient when acted upon by the actuator. The aerosolizing element prevents the agent from contacting the actuator and other non-disposable components of the system so that little or no cleaning or maintenance is required. The present system also can include an aerosolization rate monitor that monitors the rate at which an agent is being aerosolized and provides feedback to the user to ensure that the proper dose is being administered.

This is the U.S. national stage application of PCT Application No. PCT US2005 011086 filed Apr. 1 2005 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 559 318 filed Apr. 2 2004 which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention an agency of the United States Government. Therefore the United States Government may have certain rights in this invention.

The present disclosure relates generally to the delivery of agents and more particularly to systems and methods for delivery of agents using aerosol devices.

Needles and syringes have posed a variety of problems for patients and medical personnel who administer agents to the patients including injection safety needle stick injury disposal problems transmission of blood borne diseases and needle shortages during mass vaccination campaigns. The replacement of needles and syringes as the primary delivery vehicle for agents has the potential for tremendous cost savings increased safety and reduction of biomedical wastes.

Aerosol delivery of agents avoids many of the foregoing drawbacks of injection. Much of the equipment used for aerosol delivery is cumbersome and has not been widely employed for many treatment methods. Nebulizers are commonly used in hospitals for aerosol delivery of agents in the treatment of respiratory diseases. In practice a nebulizer uses compressed gases to convert a solution of the agent into fine droplets. The droplets are administered to the patient through an air stream that the patient breathes inwardly through a mouthpiece or mask. As the patient breathes the agent is delivered to the patient s lungs and absorbed therein.

Typically nebulizers rely upon an external compressed gas source to convert a solution of the agent into fine droplets. As a result of the need for an external source of compressed gas nebulizers tend to be bulky and difficult to move. Further the effectiveness of a nebulizer depends upon proper inhalation by the patient which can be difficult to monitor and to teach to the patient.

Currently used jet nebulizers function in the same general way. Liquid is drawn up to an air nozzle by capillary forces and or the Bernoulli effect. At the nozzle a high speed air jet shatters the liquid into droplets. Droplets blast against an impactor to break them up further into smaller droplets. Like most atomization processes this droplet generation process results in a size distribution. To obtain the desired small aerosol droplets baffles capture large droplets which cannot follow the airflow path well leaving the fine aerosol in the output stream of the nebulizer. The larger droplets recycle to the liquid reservoir of the nebulizer.

This nebulization process is inherently inefficient. Measurements show that typical nebulizers only convert a few percent of the aspirated liquid to fine aerosol droplets. Thus liquid will normally be recycled well in excess of twenty times before it reaches the desired size and is exhausted from the nebulizer. The inefficiency of the jet nebulizer poses problems to its use for aerosol vaccination. High velocity is needed in the air jet to provide the energy required to break the liquid into sufficiently small droplets necessitating relatively high air supply pressures in flow rates. Compressing air to provide this supply requires significant power either human or electric.

Fluid recycling in the nebulizer in the small amount of vaccine required for each dose results in the inability to operate on a dose by dose basis. Many doses need to be present in the nebulizer in order for droplet coalescence on the baffles in other surfaces to return liquid to the reservoir. In addition the repeated mechanical stress of atomization on the vaccination particles in the liquid risks diminishing the viability of the vaccine.

Another drawback of conventional nebulizers is that the components that come in contact with the agent being dispensed must be thoroughly cleaned after each session of use to prevent the growth of bacteria or other contaminants. Such cleaning and maintenance requirements pose a modest challenge in modern medical settings but can prove to be extremely difficult to achieve with untrained personnel or in underdeveloped regions of the world. Hence conventional nebulizers are impractical for use in mass vaccination campaigns especially in underdeveloped countries.

Existing vibrating mesh nebulizers have similar drawbacks. Vibrating mesh devices typically operate by ejecting droplets through tiny orifices of a thin plate the mesh that is vibrated ultrasonically by an actuator. Existing vibrating mesh devices place the agent to be aerosolized in direct contact not only with the mesh but also with the actuator. In such devices the mesh actuator surfaces and the fluid pathway in the device are intended for long term single patient use and must be cleaned after each use. Cleaning of these devices under field conditions and their use in multi patient settings such as in mass vaccination campaigns impose substantial difficulties and costs.

Monitoring or verifying the dose of aerosol delivered to a patient also poses a concern in the administration of aerosols e.g. aerosol vaccination especially when young children are involved. Unlike injection where the delivery of a dose can be clearly observed the delivery of an aerosolized agent via a nebulizer is more difficult to monitor.

Thus a need exists for effective systems and methods for administering an agent in an aerosol form without a needle and in more accurate dosages. Further a need exists for delivery systems that are easier to use and maintain and reduce the likelihood of contamination especially for use in mass vaccination campaigns.

The present disclosure concerns methods and systems including devices for delivery of agents that do not require use of needles to gain entry into a biological system. More particularly the present disclosure concerns methods and systems for aerosolizing or nebulizing agents for patient delivery. For example such systems and methods can be used for delivering agents such as pharmaceuticals chemotherapeutics immune agents and vaccines.

The present disclosure describes methods and systems for administering one or more agents to multiple patients either human or non human in single dosage applications or to an individual patient for multiple administrations. For example many patients can be immunized with an inhaled vaccine composition using the present disclosure without the need for needles or substantial cleaning or maintenance. In other applications the composition may be administered to one individual.

An embodiment of the present disclosure comprises a portable aerosol delivery device that includes a housing shaped to be held in a user s hand. The housing houses a disposable aerosolization element and an actuator that is operable to apply a moving force to the aerosolization element for aerosolizing an agent The aerosolization element can include an integral reservoir in which there is stored a predetermined volume of agent.

Alternatively the aerosolization element can be directly coupled to a vial or container in which the agent is stored. For example the aerosolization element can include a piercing prong or needle that is inserted into a puncturable closure e.g. a rubber cap of a vial to allow agent stored in the vial to flow into the aerosolization element. The amount of agent stored in the aerosolizing element and or the vial can be sufficient for administering a single dose or multiple doses of the agent.

The aerosolization element defines an internal chamber that receives agent from the reservoir and or a vial coupled to the aerosolization element. One side of the chamber is partially bounded by an orifice surface defining a plurality of orifices. The opposite side of the chamber is partially bounded by a movable element that is coupled to the actuator. Vibratory oscillations of the actuator cause the movable element to move alternately toward and away from the orifice surface. As the movable element moves closer to the orifice surface the pressure in the chamber increases and causes the agent to be expelled through the orifices in the form of aerosol droplets. As the movable element moves away from the orifice surface additional agent is drawn into the chamber to be aerosolized in the next cycle. When the aerosolization element or the vial connected to the aerosolization element is empty the aerosolization element can be removed for disposal and replaced with another aerosolization element.

Agent can be fed into the chamber of the aerosolization element either through gravity or capillary action. In the case of gravity feed the agent is stored in the reservoir and or a vial positioned above the chamber so that agent can flow into the chamber under the force of gravity. In the case of capillary feed the agent is stored in the reservoir and or a vial positioned below the chamber and is drawn upwardly into the chamber by capillary action of the agent.

Advantageously the aerosolization element prevents the agent from contacting the actuator and other non disposable components of the device so that little or no cleaning or flushing of the device is required after each session. Consequently unlike conventional nebulizers the device of the present disclosure is suitable for use in high workload applications such as mass immunization campaigns in underdeveloped nations. Use of the aerosol delivery device also avoids many of the drawbacks of administering agents via injection including the need for skilled personnel the risk of blood borne diseases high cost patient aversion to injection and the need to safely dispose of used needles and syringes.

In particular embodiments the aerosol delivery device also includes an aerosolization rate monitor that monitors the rate at which the agent is being aerosolized. The aerosolization monitor includes a light source such as a laser diode for projecting a light beam across an aerosol plume emanating from the aerosolization element. A light detector such as a photodiode detects the obscuration of the light beam which corresponds to the concentration of aerosol droplets in the aerosol plume. The device can include a visual display such as a digital readout that displays the aerosolization rate to ensure that the proper dosage is being administered. The device also can include an indicator light and or an audible alarm for warning the user when the aerosolization rate is outside an acceptable range.

The aerosol delivery device includes a patient interface that delivers the aerosolized agent to the mouth and or nose of a patient. One embodiment of the patient interface includes an angled extension portion coupled to the housing of the device and a disposable face mask that is shaped to cover the mouth and nose of the patient. In one implementation the mask is made of a porous material that allows expiratory and inspiratory air to pass through the mask but traps expired aerosol and particles e.g. cough or sneeze particles . In another implementation the mask is made of a non porous material and the extension portion is formed with one or more openings allowing inspiratory air to be drawn into the extension portion.

Another embodiment of the patient interface includes a one way valve that is operable to permit aerosolized agent to flow to the patient and restrict flow in the opposite direction. The one way valve can be for example a flapper type valve or duckbill type valve. The valve protects the aerosolization element and other revisable components against contamination caused by expired particles. In addition the entire patient interface is disposable to further protect against patient to patient contamination.

The foregoing and other objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description which proceeds with reference to the accompanying figures.

As used herein the singular forms a an and the refer to one or more than one unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

Agents as used herein comprise agents that can be administered to living organisms for an effect in the treated organism. Such agents include live and killed organisms for vaccination immunogens immune activators or suppressors chemotherapeutics pharmaceuticals nucleic acids insulin hormones antibodies and fragments thereof receptors proteins carbohydrates fats nutrients anesthetics narcotics and pain relievers.

The present disclosure is directed to methods and systems including devices for aerosol delivery of agents to a patient. The present system can be used to administer various types of agents such as vaccines and other pharmaceutical substances. Use of the present system for agent delivery such as for vaccination purposes provides many benefits. For example the present system replaces the use of needles and syringes and reduces the costs of agent delivery. Additionally the present system allows for treatment of patients by less trained staff another cost saving benefit and also helps prevent the spread of blood borne diseases by reused needles.

Certain embodiments of the present system utilize an actuator coupled to a disposable aerosolizing element that aerosolizes an agent for delivery to a patient when acted upon by the actuator. The aerosolizing element prevents the agent from contacting the actuator and other non disposable components of the system so that little or no cleaning or maintenance is required. The system therefore is well suited for use by less trained personnel in high workload applications such as mass vaccination campaigns.

The present system also can include an aerosolization rate monitor that monitors the rate at which an agent is being aerosolized and provides feedback to the user to ensure that the proper dose is being administered. For example the system can include an indicator light that illuminates or flashes if the aerosolization rate is outside an acceptable range.

Exemplary methods of the present disclosure comprise delivery of agents such as vaccine compositions. The methods of the present disclosure comprise delivery of vaccine compositions via aerosol administration. The present disclosure contemplates the use of any vaccine composition that can be delivered via aerosol administration. Particularly preferred vaccination compositions are those for measles mumps and rubella. Such compositions may comprise measles vaccine mumps vaccine rubella vaccine and combinations and mixtures such as measles and mumps rubella and mumps measles and rubella and measles mumps and rubella. The vaccines further comprise pharmaceutical or formulation components such as those known in the art including but not limited to diluents compounding agents surfactants and agents to maintain sterility.

The housing is formed with a movable front portion that is mounted for sliding movement in the directions indicated by double headed arrow between a closed position as shown in and an open position as shown in to allow access to the aerosolizing element . When the front portion is in the closed position the aerosolizing element is held firmly in place between the front portion and the actuator . A latch mechanism and a latch button can be provided to releasably retain the front portion in the closed position. Depressing the latch button removes the latch mechanism from engagement with the front portion so that it can be moved to the open position. The front portion desirably is adapted to be completely removable from the housing for ease of cleaning. While the illustrated front portion is mounted for sliding movement relative to the housing as shown any other detachable connection can be used to mount the front portion to the housing e.g. adhesives snap fittings etc. .

Coupled to the housing is a patient interface for delivering an aerosolized agent to a patient. The illustrated patient interface includes a generally cylindrical extension portion connected to the movable portion and a disposable face mask mounted to the upper end of the extension portion . The mask is mounted to the extension portion in a removable manner so that the mask can be easily removed and replaced with a new mask for another patient. The extension portion includes a first portion extending through the front portion of the housing and a second portion that extends upwardly at an angle with respect to the first portion . The extension portion may be of a rigid or flexible design and desirably is constructed from a low cost material such as rubber cardboard fiberboard or plastic.

Generally contaminants e.g. expired particles from the patient are difficult to re aerosolize unless they directly contact the surface of the aerosolizing element adjacent the orifices . The angled second portion eliminates a direct pathway from the patient back to the aerosolizing element so as to prevent expired particles e.g. cough and sneeze particles from directly contacting the aerosolizing element . Hence this protects against patient to patient contamination if the aerosolizing element is used to administer doses to multiple patients. The face mask can be made from a porous or non porous material as further described below. Other types of non disposable or disposable patient interfaces such as nasal prongs oral mouthpieces and holding chambers also can be used with the aerosol delivery device .

The actuator is operable to apply a moving force to the aerosolizing element thereby causing the aerosolizing element to expel aerosol droplets of an agent. The actuator can be any type of oscillator that can apply vibratory oscillations to the aerosolizing element . As best shown in the illustrated actuator is a piezoelectric driven actuator also known as an ultrasonic horn that includes first and second electrodes a piezoelectric element disposed between the first and second electrodes and a motion transmitting member secured to the first electrode . An end portion of the motion transmitting member is coupled to the aerosolizing element .

An oscillating electric current applied to the electrodes induces vibratory motion of the piezoelectric element which in turn induces vibratory motion of the motion transmitting member in the directions indicated by double headed arrow . The motion transmitting member transmits the vibratory motion to the aerosolizing element for aerosolizing an agent therein. In particular embodiments the actuator generates vibrations in the range of about 20 to 200 Hz. Other types of actuators such as a solenoid or a linear electric motor e.g. a voice coil such as used in a loudspeaker also can be used to induce vibration of the aerosolizing element.

As discussed above the actuator is mounted within the air manifold which directs compressed gas e.g. compressed air to flow over the actuator and carry away heat generated during operation. The manifold is formed with a flow channel substantially surrounding the actuator and an opening that is connected to a compressed air conduit . The air conduit receives compressed air from a compressed air source such as the illustrated air pump . The manifold is also formed with one or more apertures which direct air in the flow channel to flow through the aerosolizing element in the direction of arrows . Air flowing through the aerosolizing element entrains aerosol droplets expelled from the aerosolizing element and assists in the delivery of the droplets to the patient.

In lieu of or in addition to the air manifold a heat sink can be mounted to the actuator to facilitate the dissipation of heat generated during operation. As shown in the heat sink includes a plurality of angularly spaced radial fins extending longitudinally from a base mounted to and in thermal contact with the actuator . In particular embodiments the air manifold can be sized to accommodate the actuator and the heat sink . In other embodiments the actuator and optionally the heat sink can be mounted in the housing without the air manifold . In the latter embodiments air from the air pump can be ducted directly to the aerosolizing element to assist in the delivery of aerosolized agent to the patient.

As shown in the device can include a wearable or body mountable pack or case that houses the air pump e.g. a diaphragm air pump an air filter and one or more batteries for powering the device. The pack can be for example a waist pack fanny pack that can be worn around the waist of a user or a shoulder or back pack that can be worn over one or both shoulders of a user. The pack also can include a controller a charging jack for re charging the batteries and an on off power switch . The charging jack can be connected to an external power supply not shown in a conventional manner to recharge the batteries or to provide power to operate the device without use of the batteries. The pack can be coupled to the housing via a flexible umbilical that contains the air conduit and wiring connecting the controller to the actuator and a trigger switch on the housing. By housing the pump the batteries and the controller in the pack the overall weight of the housing can be reduced for easier handling. In an alternative embodiment one or more of these components can be housed in the handle portion or in another portion of the housing.

Although not shown in the illustrated embodiment a compressed air receiver or reservoir can be housed in the handle portion or the pack . The air reservoir can have an inlet that receives compressed air from the air pump via a first conduit and an outlet that supplies a charge of compressed air to the air manifold via another conduit. In another embodiment the handle portion can be equipped with a hand pump operable to charge the air receiver such as disclosed in co pending U.S. application Ser. No. 10 471 620 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2004 0134494 which is incorporated herein by reference. The device also can be equipped with a hand crank dynamo operable to recharge the batteries such as disclosed in the 620 application.

The aerosol delivery device can be operated in a continuous or automatic dose timing mode. A selector switch not shown can be provided on the handle portion or on the pack for manually setting the device to operate in either mode. In the continuous mode a user depresses the trigger switch on the handle portion which sends a signal to the controller . The controller sends a signal to the air pump and the actuator to begin operation. The aerosolizing element converts an agent drawn from the vial into droplets of a very small size e.g. in a range of about 1 to 10 micrometers although the size of the droplets can vary depending on the application . After administering a dose the user depresses the trigger switch again to turn off the actuator and the air pump.

In the automatic dose timing mode the user first sets a timer switch e.g. a rotary switch not shown operatively connected to the controller at a desired setting corresponding to a predetermined aerosolization period e.g. 15 20 30 or 60 seconds . In alternative embodiments the device can include a keypad or another type of input device to allow the user to set the desired time of application. To initiate administration of a dose the user depresses the trigger switch which activates the pump to supply air to the manifold . After a predetermined period of time e.g. 0.5 seconds the actuator is activated to aerosolize the agent in the aerosolizing element . At the end of the aerosolization period the actuator is automatically turned off after which the aerosolization element can be purged with compressed air from the pump for a predetermined period of time e.g. 5 seconds or until the switch is depressed.

Prior to loading the aerosolizing element into the housing the lever is moved toward the rear of the housing to the position depicted in . After insertion of the aerosolizing element the lever is moved toward the front of the housing to move the actuator to the operating position depicted in .

Turning now to the aerosolizing element will now be described. The aerosolizing element has a body that includes a front portion a rear portion a chamber cooperatively formed between the front portion and the rear portion and an integral reservoir formed at the upper end portion of the aerosolizing element and in fluid communication with the inlet of the chamber . A piercing prong or needle extends upwardly from a vial mount situated on top of the reservoir . The prong has a pointed upper end that is used to puncture a puncturable septum incorporated or connected to the opening of the vial . The septum can be made of an elastomeric material e.g. rubber or any of various other suitable materials. The prong also functions to hold the vial in an inverted position on top of the vial mount . While the illustrated prong is a small cylindrical tube other shaped tubes including square triangle or rectangle also can be used.

The prong is formed with a first flow passageway extending between the upper end of the prong and the reservoir to allow agent in the vial to flow into the reservoir. A second flow passageway in the prong extends between the upper end of the prong and an air inlet or opening formed in the vial mount . The opening can be fitted with a porous air permeable plug . The second flow passageway allows atmospheric air to be drawn into the vial to replace agent that is extracted from the vial. The reservoir also can be provided with an air outlet or opening fitted with a porous plug not shown to allow for venting of air in the reservoir. The porous plugs in openings and are made of a material that is permeable to air but inhibits leakage of the agent due to surface tension.

The front portion of the aerosolizing element defines an orifice surface that is formed with a plurality of orifices . The rear portion defines a movable element opposite the orifices that is coupled to the end portion of the actuator . The movable element is movable or deformable to increase pressure in the chamber in response to the force applied by the actuator . In the illustrated embodiment for example the movable element comprises a flexible diaphragm that alternately flexes inwardly and outwardly in response to movement of the actuator. In operation rapid motion of the actuator pushes the diaphragm inwardly and toward the orifices increasing pressure in the chamber and expelling agent outwardly through the orifices to form aerosol droplets . Movement of the actuator in the opposite direction causes the diaphragm to flex outwardly and away from the orifices thereby decreasing the pressure in the chamber and drawing agent into the region of the chamber behind the orifices for the next cycle. In alternative embodiments the movable portion need not be flexible or deformable but is otherwise configured to move toward and away from the front portion in response to movement of the actuator .

As shown in the aerosolizing element can be formed with one or more air flow apertures or openings extending through a peripheral portion of the element adjacent the orifice surface . The openings are in fluid communication with the apertures of the air manifold at the rear surface of the element so that air from the apertures can flow through the openings and entrain droplets expelled by the orifices for delivery to the patient.

The orifices typically are about 5 micrometers in diameter although the size of the orifices can vary depending on the desired size of the droplets . The front and rear portions can be made from any of various suitable materials such as plastic using conventional manufacturing techniques e.g. molding . The orifices can be formed directly in the front portion using conventional micro machining techniques such as laser drilling electroforming or chemical etching. As depicted in the rear portion can be of a unitary construction having a substantially constant thickness. In other embodiments the rear portion can have a relatively thinner section opposite the orifices that defines the movable element . In another embodiment e.g. the aerosolizing element shown in which is described below the movable element can be a separate element bounding the chamber opposite the orifices. In the latter embodiment the rear portion can be formed with an opening to receive the actuator for coupling to the movable element.

Preferably the aerosolizing element is disposable. If the device is used where disposal costs are not prohibitive e.g. in a modern hospital the aerosolizing element and the mask can be disposed of each time a dose is administered to a patient. However if the device is used in a high workload application such as a mass vaccination campaign disposal costs may be a concern. In such cases the aerosolizing element can be used to administer doses to multiple patients but typically would be disposed of after a session of administering multiple doses to prevent the growth of bacteria or other contaminants. Notably the aerosolizing element inhibits contact of the agent with the actuator and other re useable components of the device . Consequently substantially less time is required for cleaning and maintenance of the device compared to conventional nebulizers.

The thickness of the chamber the distance measured between the opposed internal surfaces of the front and rear portions is selected to maintain an adequate flow of agent via capillary action without inducing a pressure loss that exceeds the capillary head. As shown the aerosolizing element can include one or more spaced apart dimples or projections disposed in the chamber . The projections maintain a minimum spacing in the chamber between the movable portion and the front portion of the element so as to maintain adequate capillary head without undue pressure loss.

The front portion is formed with an opening in which there is fitted an orifice plate having multiple orifices for expelling droplets of agent. In one implementation the aerosolizing element is filled with a predetermined volume of agent and sealed by a pharmaceutical manufacturer or pharmacy. In this regard a removable sealing tape can be placed over the orifice plate to prevent leakage of agent and the ingress of foreign matter and other desired material into element prior to use. Likewise a removable sealing tape a removable tab or other closure can be used to close the venting port . The sealing tapes and are then removed by the user prior to administering the agent.

As shown in the chamber and the first reservoir are filled with a first liquid and the second reservoir is filled with a second liquid. A plug or separation element is disposed in the aerosolizing element between the first and second reservoirs to keep the liquids separated from each other prior to use. The second reservoir has an open top that is fitted with a plug . A removable annular ring is disposed around the plug and seated against the open end of the second reservoir . The plug is formed with an annular flange portion that overlaps the ring . The ring prevents inadvertent or premature mixing of the first and second liquids by resisting movement of the plug into the second reservoir .

To reconstitute the first and second liquids at the time of use the user removes the ring and pushes down on the plug to pressurize the second reservoir . Due to the incompressibility of the liquid the liquid forces the plug into the wider area of the first reservoir thereby allowing the liquid in the second reservoir to mix with the liquid in the first reservoir as shown in . In use the agent can be fed from the reservoir into the chamber via gravity or capillary action.

As shown in the chamber and the first reservoir are filled with a liquid e.g. a diluent for a dry component and the second reservoir is filled with a powder e.g. lyophilate or another type of dry component A plug is disposed in the aerosolizing element between the first and second reservoirs to keep the dry component separated from the liquid component prior to use. The second reservoir has an open top that is fitted with a plug . A rigid push rod e.g. a glass rod extends from the plug and contacts the plug . The body can be formed with a venting port between the first and second reservoirs and adjacent the plug . As shown in the plug covers the port to prevent leakage prior to use.

To reconstitute the liquid and dry components at the time of use the user removes the ring and pushes down on the plug . Movement of the plug and the push rod forces the plug into the wider area of the first reservoir thereby allowing the dry component in the second reservoir to mix with the liquid in the first reservoir and form an agent for administering to a patient as shown in . Displacement of the plug also exposes the first reservoir to atmospheric pressure via the venting port to facilitate the flow of agent into the chamber . In use the agent can be fed from the reservoir into the chamber via gravity or capillary action.

The front portion is formed with an opening in which there is fitted an orifice plate for expelling droplets of agent. The body further includes peripheral portions on opposite sides of the chamber . Formed in the peripheral portions are respective air flow passageways . As best shown in each passageway extends from an inlet formed in the rear portion to one or more outlets formed in the front portion at locations offset from the inlet . When the aerosolizing element is placed in the housing of an aerosol delivery device e.g. the device shown in the inlets are positioned to receive compressed air from the air manifold . Air flows into the inlets through the passageways and exits the outlets as indicated by arrows to entrain droplets expelled by the orifice plate . Because the outlets are offset from the inlet there is less likelihood that expired particles from the patient can travel through the passageways and contact the actuator or other reusable portions of the system.

Disposed between the front and rear portions is an orifice plate e.g. an electroformed mesh plate and a flexible spacer element . A chamber for receiving agent from the reservoir is defined between the orifice plate and the spacer element . The orifice plate is formed with a plurality of orifices that are aligned with an opening in the front portion . The spacer element is formed with a plurality of projections that maintain a minimum spacing in the chamber between the orifice plate and the spacer element . Although not required the orifice plate and the spacer element can be held together by a piece of adhesive tape placed over the orifice plate and secured to the lower end portion of the spacer element for ease of assembly. The tape is formed with an opening aligned with the opening in the front portion . The rear portion is formed with an opening that is sized to receive the front end portion of the actuator . A piece of double sided tape can be used to secure the end portion of the actuator to the spacer element . A suitable sealant e.g. silicone can be used to secure the tape to the inside surface of the front portion and to secure the spacer element to the inside surface of the rear portion .

In particular embodiments the orifice plate comprises a thin metal foil e.g. nickel aluminum gold or another suitable metal having a thickness of about 0.05 mm. Other suitable materials such as ceramics or composite materials also can be used to form the orifice plate . The orifices can be formed using conventional micro machining techniques such as laser drilling electroforming and chemical etching. The spacer element comprises a thin flexible plastic having a thickness of about 0.1 mm. The projections on the spacer element have a height of about 0.1 mm. Of course these specific dimensions as well as other dimensions provided in the present specification and materials are given to illustrate the invention and not to limit it. The dimensions and materials provided herein can be modified as needed in different applications or situations.

The spacer element serves as a flexible diaphragm for expelling agent through the orifice plate . In use the end portion of the actuator extends through the opening and bears against the spacer element . Vibration of the actuator is transmitted to the spacer element causing it to flex toward and away from the orifice plate alternately forcing agent in the chamber through the orifices and drawing agent into the chamber from the reservoir .

The mask in this embodiment is made of a non porous material a material that does not allow passage of air and includes a one way valve to allow for the release of expiratory flow. The valve houses a flexible sealing member that covers openings in the mask in its normal at rest position to prevent outside air from flowing into the mask. During exhalation the sealing member opens to allow expiratory air to flow through openings and openings to the environment.

In its normal at rest position the sealing member contacts or partially overlaps the valve seat to close the flow path from the aerosolizing element to the patient . During inhalation the sealing member opens to allow aerosol droplets and air to flow to the patient . During exhalation the valve closes to protect the aerosolizing element and other re useable components against contamination from expired particles. In another embodiment the patient interface can include both the valve and baffles to further protect against contamination. The patient interface like the patient interface preferably is disposable.

Although the patient interfaces shown in are shown being used in an aerosol delivery device having an actuator and an aerosolizing element this is not a requirement. Accordingly the patient interfaces can be implemented in other types of aerosol delivery systems such as jet nebulizer systems and pneumatic aerosol delivery systems.

FIGS. and A C show an aerosol delivery device according to another embodiment. The aerosol delivery device includes a body or housing formed with a handle portion shaped to be held in a user s hand. The housing houses a removable aerosolizing element an actuator and an air manifold substantially surrounding the actuator . The aerosolizing element has a construction that is similar to the construction of the aerosolizing element shown in . Thus components in FIGS. and A C that are similar to components in are given the same reference numerals and are not described further. As shown in the aerosolizing device further includes a piercing prong extending from a venting port into a vial .

The handle portion houses an air pump that is fluidly coupled to the air manifold via an air conduit . A first indicator light on the housing provides a visual indication of whether an agent is being aerosolized. A second indicator light provides a visual indication of whether the aerosolization rate is outside a predetermined acceptable range. The indicator lights can be for example LEDs or lamps.

A front portion of the housing is mounted for sliding movement toward and away from the aerosolizing element as indicated by double headed arrow . In its closed operating position as shown in the front portion holds the aerosolizing element firmly in place against the actuator . The front portion can be moved to an open position spaced from the housing to access the aerosolizing element .

A latch mechanism for releasably retaining the front portion in the closed position comprises a button extending through the housing a lever connected to the housing by a pivot pin and a latch pin extending upwardly into a corresponding latch opening in the front portion . One end the lever is coupled to the latch pin and the opposite end of the lever bears against the button . A torsion spring disposed around the pivot pin biases the lever in the counterclockwise direction in to retain the latch pin in the latch opening in the front portion . Depressing the button moves in the lever in the clockwise direction which in turn removes the latch pin from the latch opening so that the front portion can be moved to the open position. The front portion desirably is completely removable from the housing for ease of cleaning.

The front portion defines an air flow plenum in fluid communication with the manifold and a co axially extending inner conduit that receives aerosolized agent from the aerosolizing element . The inner conduit is formed with one or more openings in fluid communication with the air flow plenum . Coupled to the front portion is a patient interface that includes an upwardly angled extension portion and a disposable face mask . The extension portion desirably is connected to the forward portion in a removable manner for ease of cleaning or for disposal.

In use air from the air pump flows into the manifold via the conduit to cool the actuator . A portion of the airflow is ducted into the internal conduit via openings in the aerosolizing element to assist in carrying aerosol droplets to the patient. Another portion of the airflow in the manifold is ducted into the air flow plenum and then into the inner conduit via openings as indicated by arrows . The airflow from the plenum assists in preventing deposition of aerosol droplets on the inner conduit by directing the flow of aerosol droplets away from the inner surface.

The aerosol delivery device also includes an aerosolization rate monitor that is operable to monitor the rate at which an agent is being aerosolized by the aerosolizing element by detecting the obscuration of a light beam passing through an aerosol plume emanating from the aerosolization element . Referring also to the aerosolization rate monitor includes a light source e.g. a diode laser or a light emitting diode LED and a light detector or sensor e.g. a photodiode both of which are coupled to the rear surface of the manifold . First and second passageways and respectively extend between the front and rear surfaces of the manifold . The aerosolization element includes first and second reflectors and respectively positioned on opposite sides of an orifice plate . Each reflector has a reflective surface positioned at approximately a 45 degree angle with respect to the first and second passageways in the manifold .

The light source projects a light beam through the first passageway the aerosolization element and onto the reflective surface of the first reflector . The first reflector reflects the light beam across the aerosol plume emanating from the aerosolization element and onto the reflective surface of the second reflector . The second reflector reflects the light beam back through the aerosolization element and the second passageway toward the light detector . The aerosolization element desirably is made of a transparent material e.g. clear plastic to transmit the incident and reflected light beam. Alternatively the aerosolization element can be made of a non transparent material having openings aligned with the first and second passageways to allow the incident and reflected light beam to pass through the aerosolization element. The reflective surfaces can be formed by applying reflective paint or a layer of reflective material e.g. reflective tape on the reflectors .

As the aerosol plume passes through the reflected light beam as best shown in the light detector detects the obscuration of the light beam which corresponds to the concentration of aerosol droplets in the aerosol plume. The light detector relays a signal to a controller which determines the aerosolization rate. If the aersolization rate is outside of the acceptable range the indicator light illuminates or begins flashing to provide a visual indication of this condition. The system also can include a digital readout mounted at a convenient location on the housing to provide a digital readout of the aerosolization rate. Other indicating devices such as an audible alarm also can be used to provide the user information regarding the operating status of the system.

The system also can be equipped with a counting device that counts or records the number of doses administered and the amount of each dose. In one implementation for example the controller can have memory for recording dose information e.g. number and amount of each dose and other information regarding the operation of the system. Information recorded in the memory can be displayed on the digital readout . The device also can include a removable memory device e.g. a flash memory card for storing such operating information. Additionally a communication port not shown can be provided to allow operating information of the device to be communicated to a general purpose computer e.g. a laptop via a cable or a wireless connection.
