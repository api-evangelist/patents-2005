title: Additional functionality for telephone numbers and utilization of context information associated with telephone numbers in computer documents
abstract: Telephone numbers are identified and highlighted on any computer document being loaded into a graphical user interface (GUI) for viewing by a user, and context information associated with the telephone numbers so tagged may also be viewed. The user may click on any particular highlighted telephone number or context information in the computer document while displayed in the GUI window in order to store the telephone number together with any desired context information associated therewith, or perform other functions, such as sending a facsimile transmission to the number, sending a message (e.g., SMS, IM or e-mail) or searching an associated database for prior occurrences of the telephone number or context information.
