title: Direct drive hybrid rotary motor
abstract: A rotary motor shaft extends through a rheological brake unit through which variable braking resistance to rotation of the motor shaft is applied while it undergoes rotation in response to torque mechanically applied thereto in sequence through a peripheral gear by a selected pair of diagonally aligned electro-magnetically energized push-rod actuators adjustably positioned axially along a varying diameter section of the gear under electrical control for stroke change to yield a variable output torque.

This application is a continuation in part of U.S. Nonprovisional application Ser. No. 10 807 580 filed Mar. 23 2004 now abandoned entitled Direct Drive Hybrid Rotary Motor. incorporated herein by reference.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates generally to an electro mechanically controlled electro magnetic conversion type of rotary motor.

Electromagnetic drive motors with operational phase controls are generally known in the art as disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 602 434 to Riedl involving use of electromagnetic actuator rods engageable with a rotor under phase control to induce rotation thereof.

An important object of the present invention is to provide an electrically powered motor having plural components matched to the output torque load being applied in mechanical impedance manner for enhancing electro motive energy conversion.

Pursuant to the present invention an electric motor has an output shaft connected to a sloped lobe gear having peripheral gear teeth that varies in diameter along an axial end section thereof. Torque is applied to the output shaft by engagement of said variable diameter end section of the gear with push rods projecting from electromagnetic actuators positioned in angular spaced relation to each other about the output shaft on rail supports anchored to a rheological brake unit through which the output shaft extends. Under control applied through magnetic fields to rheological fluid within the brake unit braking effect is removed from the gear during a free wheeling operational phase. Electrical energy is also applied to the actuators for mechanically imparting torque to the output shaft through a pair of aligned push rods engaging the peripheral gear at an axial location along the variable diameter end section selected under stroke control for selectively varied conversion of drive force into the torque applied to the output shaft.

Referring now to the drawing in detail illustrates a rotary drive motor having an axially elongated output rotor shaft with a small diameter end and an opposite larger diameter base end . According to the embodiment shown in a clutch brake unit is positioned on an end section of the shaft adjacent the base end in abutment with a thrust bearing component . A torque drive imparting assembly generally referred to by reference numeral is positioned on the shaft between the unit and a small diameter shaft end section at the axial shaft end .

As shown in the torque drive imparting assembly includes four actuator units positioned in 90 angular relation to each other about the shaft . Each of such actuator units includes a pair of cylindrical actuator devices held in close parallel spaced relation to each other within a support . Each of the actuator supports as shown in is adjustably positioned within an elongated rail at an outer end opposite an inner end anchored to the unit . Each rail accordingly extends in angular relation to the axis of the shaft radially spaced therefrom by an increasing amount from the anchored rail ends to the opposite rail ends at which the actuator devices are adjustably positioned by adjustment devices along an axial end section of a peripheral gear connected to the shaft end section . Projecting from each of the cylindrical actuator devices is a driving push rod for engagement with the periphery of the gear along its axial end section so as to impart a continuously varying output torque to the output shaft

As shown in the actuator units may be axially displaced on its support from an axial position at the end of its rail as designated in to two other axial positions and along the axial end section of the gear so as to effect a change in stroke of the drive forces applied to shaft by the actuator driven push rods dependent on the variation in peripheral diameter of the gear along the end section . Such repositioning of the actuator units on the rails is effected by the positioning adjustment devices respectively mounted on each of the rails and connected to the actuator unit supports .

With continued reference to the unit is shown positioned on an intermediate larger diameter hollowed section of the shaft extending between the shaft end sections and . The unit includes an outer cylindrical housing positioned on the section in abutment with the thrust bearing component at one axial end opposite its other axial housing end plate . The ends of the rails are anchored to the housing end plate . The housing is fixedly anchored in position on the shaft section for rotational support of the shaft which is rotated relative to the housing about its axis . Enclosed within the housing are chambers filled with a magneto reheological fluid in surrounding relation to the shaft section which is peripherally formed with splines through which a pair discs within the chambers are positioned rotationally fixed to the shaft by the shaft section . An electromagnetic coil is also positioned within the housing overlying a pair of permanent magnets to partially or fully negate the braking effect thereby applied to the shaft by the magnetic fields of the magnets for free wheeling purposes. The magneto rheological fluid filing the chamber within such magnetic fields provides variable braking resistance to rotation of the shaft through the discs .

As diagrammed in an electrical power source supplies electrical energy through timing phase control to one pair of the four actuator devices associated with the drive torque imparting assembly from which the generated drive forces are transferred through the gear as torque applied to the output shaft . The pair of the actuator devices selected for imparting torque are aligned with each other along a diagonal line as indicated in . The electrical energy from the source is also supplied through control to the positioning devices for adjustable displacement of the drive torque imparting assembly between its positions and for stroke change purposes. Finally through the free wheel control electrical energy from the source is applied to coil in the unit during power off phase of operation with respect to drive of the output shaft by the actuators for free wheeling purposes.

Obviously other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
