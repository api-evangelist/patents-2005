The Government of the United States of America may have rights in the present invention as a result of Contract No. N00019 97 C 0050 awarded by the Department of the Navy.

The present invention relates to a seal arrangement for use in gas turbine engines and more particularly to a tandem dual element seal used in the seal arrangement.

Carbon seals have been the bearing compartment primary seal of choice in engines for many years. Segmented circumferential carbon SCC seals have been used in recent engines based upon their low air consumption and their ability to accommodate large relative motion in the axial direction. This sealing system consists of static components the carbons which are contained within a metallic housing typically constructed of titanium or steel. The rotating component that comprises the other half of the sealing system is referred to as the seal runner. Air pressure and circumferential springs compress the static carbons against the rotating seal runner to keep the oil contained within the bearing compartment.

Referring now to one approach for isolating one cavity from a second cavity involves the use of a single element carbon ring seal on each rotating shaft. The carbon ring seal separates the buffer gas cavity from the cavity in the bearing compartment. Adequate pressure is maintained in the cavity by use of a labyrinth seal which is placed between the cavity and the cavity to backpressure the buffer gas. There are shortcomings using this approach. For example the approach is subject to a lack of gap control between cavity and the cavity via the labyrinth seal which results in varying back pressure and varying seal delta P P . Increasing the labyrinth seal gap to accommodate maneuver deflections reduces the buffer gas pressure thereby reducing the delta P across the carbon seals. The changes in pressure in the cavity greatly influences pressure in the cavity and therefore the seal delta P.

Another deficiency of the prior art seal arrangements is that they are dependent upon other features such as labyrinths in order to seal the bearing compartment.

In the seal arrangements of the present invention a tandem segmented or circumferential carbon seal configuration is used to isolate a cavity at a location where two rotating shafts are positioned.

Seal arrangements in accordance with the present invention are more robust and less reliant on other features.

In accordance with the present invention a sealing system for use with at least one rotating shaft is provided. The sealing system has a tandem seal arrangement for contacting a surface of the at least one rotating shaft. The tandem seal arrangement has a pair of segmented ring assemblies. Each of the pair of segmented ring assemblies contacts the surface of the at least one rotating shaft.

Other details of the tandem dual element intershaft carbon seal of the present invention as well as other objects and advantages attendant thereto are set forth in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals depict like elements.

A key measure of seal performance is the ability to maintain a desired pressure difference across the seal elements. This pressure difference or P is defined as positive if the pressure outside of the seal such as in cavity is higher than a bearing compartment pressure such as that in cavity . Typically a positive P is required to maintain oil and cool air within the bearing compartment.

Referring now to in accordance with the present invention a sealing system is provided. The sealing system includes tandem seal arrangements for separating or isolating two cavities bounded by rotating shafts and . Each of the tandem seal arrangements as shown in is formed by segmented ring assemblies which comprise a plurality of carbon seal elements . The segmented seal ring assemblies formed by the carbon ring seal elements replace the labyrinth seal in the prior art designs. As the carbon seal elements have substantially less leakage than the labyrinth seal the resulting delta P across the seal is higher at all operational conditions. This results in a seal that is less likely to weep oil at lower power conditions.

As shown in the construction of each segmented ring assembly consists of assembling a plurality of arch shaped carbon segments or elements preferably three or more segments elements end to end to form the segmented ring assembly. Each end of a carbon segment element has a groove and tongue configuration to allow adjacent carbon segments elements to interlock and provide good sealing characteristics under a variety of radial excursions. Each assembled segmented circumferential ring assembly is preferably radially held in place with the use of a garter spring element . The garter spring element serves other functions including maintaining the carbon segments in contact with a respective shaft or during operation and allowing the carbon segments to separate and retract radially during shaft excursions. The garter spring element also is used to maintain contact on a respective shaft or during low speed or when pressure difference or delta P across the seal rings is low.

As shown in the seal system of the present invention preferably has two tandem seal arrangements formed by pairs of segmented ring assemblies at each location. Each tandem seal arrangement may have a spring plate sandwiched between the segmented ring assemblies . The spring plate may contain compression springs or other spring elements that provide a force which acts upon the carbon segments forming the ring assemblies and propels them against a seal housing and a cover plate providing the axial component of the seal. The cover plate provides a sealing surface against which one of the ring assemblies abuts.

The seal housing is where the tandem seal arrangements having the carbon seal ring assemblies reside. The housing provides the following functionality adjoining axial sealing surface for the segmented circumferential seal ring assemblies means for providing pressurized buffer air to the segmented circumferential ring assemblies providing a means for mounting and providing a means to route any medium in cavity that may have migrated past the seals.

The housing may consist of a main housing and a seal plate . The seal plate provides a sealing surface and a means for encapsulating the tandem seal arrangement . The housing may also have a retaining ring that is installed in a groove after the carbon seal and cover plate is in place to secure the entire assembly.

The assembled segmented ring assemblies are prohibited from rotating in the housing so that premature wear of the housing and or the carbon in the assemblies is not experienced. Anti rotation devices may be used to prevent rotation of the segmented ring assemblies . Each anti rotation device may be a pin a tab a keyway or any other suitable anti rotation mechanism known in the art. The anti rotation devices preferably do not inhibit radial motion of the carbon segments either individually or as an assembly.

Tandem seals which are made of carbon grade material contact a surface of each respective shaft independently in addition to the walls of the seal housing and cover plate to isolate the cavity from cavity and vice versa. The shafts and can rotate either clockwise or counterclockwise and can have similar or dissimilar sealing surface diameters.

In operation a pressurized gaseous medium is supplied from a gas source to the buffer radial annuli or cavities . The pressurized gas source can be either a turbine engine flow path not shown or an independent pressure feed not shown . The pressurized gaseous medium may be supplied to the cavities from the gas source using any suitable means known in the art. By supplying pressurized gas to the buffer annulus or cavities carbon seal ring assemblies for each shaft and are activated and aid in sealing of the cavities and by either contacting non contacting pressure balanced or non pressure balanced means. Providing a buffer gas pressure in cavity above the pressures of either cavity or cavity will prevent communication between the cavities and thereby effectively isolate them.

The sealing system of the present invention functions better than the current approach single element seal with downstream labyrinth seal . The results using the sealing system of the present invention will be a relative high positive delta P across the seal at all engine power settings which will minimize oil weepage. The effective isolation of cavity from cavity provided by the segmented carbon ring assemblies also greatly reduces the sensitivity of cavity pressure to changes in the pressure in cavity .

It is apparent that there has been provided in accordance with the present invention a tandem dual element intershaft carbon seal which fully satisfies the objects means and advantages set forth hereinbefore. While the present invention has been described in the context of specific embodiments thereof other alternatives modifications and variations will become apparent to those skilled in the art having read the foregoing description. Accordingly it is intended to embrace those alternatives modifications and variations as fall within the broad scope of the appended claims.
