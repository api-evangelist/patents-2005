The present invention relates to an information search provision apparatus and an information search provision system and particularly relates to an information search provision apparatus and an information search provision system for providing contents such as texts images programs etc. to be posted on a web page on a network such as Internet as search results.

In recent years as use of the Internet has progressed the number of WWW World Wide web users the major application thereof has rapidly increased and the flow of electronic information has becoming extremely active. Accompanying this a problem of difficulty for users to retrieve truly desired information has emerged due to a dramatic increase in the amount of information. In order to reduce such problems various search engines came out on networks such as the Internet.

Technology has been disclosed wherein a web page on which the targeted information was found when users performed searches in the past is estimated and from the estimated results points are given to the search keywords as well as the URL Uniform Resource Locator of the web page and the presenting order in later searches is determined for search results of contents according to the descending order of points.

According to Patent Document 1 the possibility of a web page containing the desired information to be found by the users certainly becomes high. However when contents posted on a web page is used and if the contents are unreliable contents it is highly likely that the users suffer from disadvantages. Therefore it is necessary to create a new information search system to reduce such an inconvenience.

The present invention has been conducted in view of such an objective and the purpose of which is to provide an information search provision apparatus and an information search provision system for realizing a new information search service to differentiate reliable contents from unreliable contents.

One embodiment of the present inventions relates to an information search provision apparatus. This information search provision apparatus is an information search provision apparatus for acquiring a search conditional statement and providing contents matching the search conditional statement as a search result and the apparatus comprises a collection unit which collects contents to be evaluated posted on a web page via a network at a predetermined timing and a reliability control unit which increases or decreases a degree of reliability of the contents to be evaluated depending on whether it is possible for the collection unit to collect the contents to be evaluated.

According to this embodiment the contents can be evaluated in terms of reliability depending on whether it is possible to collect the contents to be evaluated. As a result reliable contents can be separated from unreliable contents thus realizing a highly convenient information search service for users.

An information search provision apparatus according to this embodiment may further comprise a search condition receiving unit which acquires a search conditional statement from a user a search unit which searches contents matching the acquired search conditional statement and a reliability presenting unit which presents to the user a degree of reliability of the searched contents. The apparatus may further comprise a prediction unit which predicts the degree of reliability of the contents to be evaluated based on an element contributed to estimating a duration of contents contained in the contents to be evaluated wherein the reliability presenting unit may present the predicted reliability to the user.

The reliability control unit may gradually increase the degree of reliability of the contents to be evaluated in a period of time during which the contents to be evaluated is acquired continuously at a predetermined timing by the collection unit. For example suppose that the contents to be evaluated had been collected by the collection unit after the first timing and thereafter the contents to be evaluated have not been collected by the collection unit since the second timing and thereafter the contents to be evaluated have been collected by the collection unit since the third timing. Then an increase range controlling unit may control the increase range in a manner that the increase range of reliability of the contents to be evaluated at the third timing is lower than that at the first timing.

An information search provision apparatus according to this embodiment may further comprise a history increase range controlling unit which controls an increase range in the degree of reliability of the contents to be evaluated according to a history on whether it is possible to collect the contents to be evaluated. The apparatus may further comprise a relationship determining unit which determines the presence or absence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated wherein the reliability control unit may control in a manner that an increase range of the contents to be evaluated when the presence of a relation is determined by the relationship determining unit is set higher than that when the absence thereof is determined.

Based on whether or not related information indicative of the presence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated is contained in the contents to be evaluated the relationship determining unit may determine the presence or absence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated. Based on whether or not related information indicative of the presence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated is contained in the highly reliable contents the relationship determining unit may determine the presence or absence of a relationship between highly reliable contents and the contents to be evaluated.

It is to be noted that any arbitrary combination or rearrangement of the above described structural components and so forth are all effective as and encompassed by the present embodiments.

Moreover this summary of the invention does not necessarily describe all necessary features so that the invention may also be sub combination of these described features.

Users access to the information search provision apparatus to conduct a search by designating a search conditional statement using a WWW browser not illustrated to be installed on the terminal apparatus . The information search provision apparatus extracts contents matching the search conditional statement and information associated with the contents hereinafter referred to as contents associated information from the large volume of information contained in the database not illustrated in upon receiving the search execution indicated by the search conditional statement and provides a list of the search results to the terminal apparatus . Then the reliability degree of the contents is further presented. The contents associated information includes the URL of a web page the size of the contents the date on which the contents will be updated and the title of the contents etc. Moreover the large volume of contents contained in a database is regularly or irregularly collected from web pages by the collection controlling unit not illustrated in on the information search provision apparatus .

The transmitting unit sends the search conditional statement from the user acquired by the search condition receiving unit to the information search provision apparatus via the network . Then the search process is performed by the information search provision apparatus . The acquisition unit acquires contents matching the search conditional statement and contents associated information such as the size of the contents and a list of URLs via the network . Then the reliability degree of the contents is further presented. The presenting unit formats the information acquired by the acquisition unit to be displayed to the user via a display not illustrated . Moreover the user may also be notified by voice via a speaker not illustrated .

Each configuration element of the information search provision apparatus is realized by the CPU Central Processing Unit the memory and other elements of a given computer in terms of hardware components and by a program etc. having an information search a collection function a storage function and other functions loaded into the memory as software. However herein function blocks realized by the collaboration of these are illustrated. Therefore it is understandable among those in the industry that these function blocks may be realized solely by the hardware or the software or in various forms depending on the combination of these.

The search condition acquisition unit acquires a search conditional statement from a user that has been sent by the transmitting unit . Then if the search conditional statement is in the form of a natural sentence the search condition acquisition unit may send the search conditional statement to a keyword extracting unit not illustrated . Then the keyword extracting unit will break down the search conditional statement into morphemes In particular nouns are extracted as keywords such as beef dish recipe etc. using examples from previous search conditional statements and the search condition acquisition unit acquires the combination of these keywords as a new search conditional statement.

The search unit searches contents that match the search conditional statement acquired in the search condition acquisition unit the reliability degree of the contents or contents associated information from searched information files stored in the search information storage . Then the search unit may perform a search using what is known as an index file or in other words files containing index words with respect to the contents stored in the search information storage . Accordingly a speedy search may be accomplished. The search results provision unit provides a list of information obtained from a search as the search results to the terminal apparatus . Then the reliability presentation unit presents to the terminal apparatus the reliability degree to be described later of the searched contents. Accordingly users are able to ascertain the extent of the reliability degree of the contents.

The access unit accesses the web server by referring to location information indicating the location of the web server such as an IP address contained in access history files in the access history storage to be described later. As another example the access unit may access a web page by referring to the URL or domain name of the web page. The access unit related to the present embodiment is presumed to access every IP address including unused IP addresses contained in the access history files once a day such as at 12 00 A.M. following that order. Furthermore the frequency of accesses by the access unit may be twice a day or even once every two days not limited to once a day. Access by the access unit may be irregular instead of regular.

The access determining unit determines whether access by the access unit to a particular web page was possible. Then when it is determined that access was not possible the access determining unit sets an x flag in the column of the present date in the Access History column to be described later under the IP address. Alternatively when it is determined that access by the access unit was possible the access determining unit sets an o flag in the column of the present date in the Access History column to be described later under the IP address.

The time specifying unit specifies the time at which access by the access unit to the web page first became possible by referring to the access history files. More specifically the time specifying unit regards the date when x in the past access history until then first switched to o as the web page provision start date. The time specifying unit sets the present date in the column of the web page provision start date to be described later when it is determined that the present date is equivalent to the web page provision start date. When the web page already exists on the network and an access was made by the access unit later the time specifying unit may determine that the date when an access was made is equivalent to the web page provision start date.

Meanwhile in recent years the shortage of IP addresses has been a problem accompanied by the increase of servers connected to the Internet. According to the present embodiment unused IP addresses may be specified by regarding IP addresses with an x flag for an extended period of time as being unused. Consequently if the third party organizations etc. managing IP addresses provide their unused IP addresses to information providers who wish to acquire other IP addresses the IP addresses may more effectively be used.

The access history storage contains access history files including correspondence between a determination by the access determining unit and the time at which the access unit has accessed the web page. As many IP addresses as possible existing on a network are presumed to be held in the access history files. Needless to say some IP addresses may be retained or possibly none. The search information storage contains searched information files containing contents collected by the collecting unit to be described later contents associated information and degrees of reliability etc.

The collecting unit collects the contents to be evaluated posted on a web page at a predetermined time herein once a day when it is determined by the access determining unit that access to the web page was possible. Furthermore when an access is made using an IP address or a domain name by the access unit the collecting unit may collect the contents to be posted on all the web pages on the web server. In the event of collecting contents the collecting unit generates contents associated information of the collected contents to be held in the search information storage . If meta tags are stated in the header of the HTML Hyper Text Markup Language sentence within the contents such as between and the collecting unit may follow the contents of an indication described in the area surrounded by the meta tag. In other words if a registration into the information search provision apparatus is clearly stated as unnecessary the collecting unit does not have to collect information of the page.

The reliability controlling unit increases or decreases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated at a predetermined time herein once a day depending on whether it was possible for the collecting unit to collect the contents to be evaluated. More specifically when it was possible to collect the contents to be evaluated from a web page the reliability controlling unit increases the reliability degree that has been set for the contents to be evaluated by a predetermined range of increase. Alternatively when the collecting unit was unable to collect the contents to be evaluated from the web page the reliability degree that has been set for the contents to be evaluated is decreased. Moreover from the web page provision start date the reliability controlling unit starts controlling the increase or decrease of the reliability degree of the contents to be posted on a web page.

Furthermore the reliability controlling unit gradually increases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated during a period of time in which it continues to be possible to collect by the collecting unit the contents to be evaluated at a predetermined time. Moreover in the present embodiment the reliability degree of contents is increased or decreased which is essentially the same as increasing or decreasing the reliability degree of the web page posting the contents and the reliability degree of the web server that publishes the web page or of the information provider running the web server. Furthermore this is essentially the same as increasing or decreasing the reliability degree of various other service providing servers included in a computer system provided by the information provider running a web server such as a mail server an FTP File Transfer Protocol server or a news server etc.

According to the information search provision apparatus related to the present embodiment by setting the reliability degree for contents it becomes possible to present to users the extent of the reliability degree of the contents. Consequently the users are able to easily ascertain the reliability degree of the contents through information search services provided by the information search provision apparatus . For example when dealing with other corporations one company may wish to know the background of the other party. On such an occasion the reliability degree of a web page provided by the corporation may be found through the search results from an information search provision apparatus . When dealing with overseas corporations this is especially significant as there are many occasions on which the background of the other party is not known compared to cases with domestic corporations. Furthermore because the request from a credit agency for a credit check of the other party in the transaction for investigating the credit of that corporation may be eliminated effort and cost may be reduced.

According to the information search provision apparatus in the present embodiment as contents are continuously posted on a web page the reliability degree is increased. Therefore as a web server provides a web page stably over a long period of time a higher reliability degree can be set. Suppose that a web page is for example the page for a shopping mall providing Internet shopping services if the reliability degree of the contents posted on the web page is high users are able to ascertain that the provider providing the web page has been continuously running its business stably for a long time. On the other hand if the reliability degree is low the provider of the web page may have just started business or it may be highly likely that the dealer unscrupulously continues to move the company s web page.

According to the information search provision apparatus in the present embodiment by differentiating reliable contents from unreliable contents based on the reliability degree to be presented to users the users may select only contents having a high reliability degree from among the search results. Accordingly the users are able to use services provided by reputable dealers by selecting contents having a high reliability degree. Consequently the information search provision apparatus is capable of accomplishing services that are particularly convenient for users.

A history increase range controlling unit controls the range of increase in the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated according to the history of whether it was possible for the collecting unit to collect the contents to be evaluated. For example if the contents to be evaluated were first collected by the collecting unit after Jan. 1 2004 and then the contents to be evaluated were not collected by the collecting unit after Feb. 1 2004 and further the contents to be evaluated were collected by the collecting unit after Mar. 1 2004 the history increase range controlling unit controls the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated on Mar. 1 2004 in a manner in which it is set lower than the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated on Jan. 1 2004. Furthermore the history increase range controlling unit may after a certain period of time lower the range of increase of the reliability degree of contents that have been controlled to the range of increase estimated when it was not low. More specifically the reduced range of increase as of Mar. 1 2004 may also be added to the range of increase for the current reliability degree a year later on Mar. 1 2005. 

Accordingly the range of increase of the reliability degree of a web page from which contents have continued to be collectable for a long period of time becomes greater than the range of increase of the reliability degree of a web page from which the contents have become no longer collectable in the process. Thus the range of increase for both may be differentiated. Consequently the importance of continuously providing contents can be more evident.

The IP Address column includes an IP address for the web server to be connected to the network . Although the IP addresses stored in the IP Address column in are in IPv4 format as another example IPv6 format may be acceptable. The URL column comprises what is known as a URL or in other words information indicating the location of a web page on the network . The Contents column includes contents collected by the collecting unit and text data written in HTML Hyper Text Markup Language in . The Web Page Provision Start Date column includes the date when the web server began providing a web page. The Reliability column includes the reliability degree of contents to be posted on a web page. The Range of Increase column includes the range of increase of the reliability degree.

For example with regard to data it is shown therein that the IP address of the web server is 200.100.100.001 the URL of the web page on the web server is http 1 the web page provision start date is Jan. 1 2004 the current reliability degree of the contents is 600 and the range of increase of the reliability degree is 5. In other words it is indicated that the reliability degree of the contents to be posted on the web page having a URL of http 1 is increased by 5 once a day herein at a predetermined time within the period during which the contents are posted on the web page.

In for convenience the display of access history for the period of January 2 through May 1 May 5 through May 30 and June 3 through August 31 is omitted. However the access history during the respective period is presumed keep the flag value of the day before the beginning date of the respective period. Furthermore in although the access history from Jan. 1 2004 to the present date Sep. 1 2004 is shown needless to say the Access History column may also include access history prior to Dec. 31 2003. 

For example with regard to the first data it is shown that the IP address of the web server is 200.100.100.001 and it has been possible for the access unit to access the web page from January 1 to the present date September 1. In other words it is indicated that during that period the web server has continuously provided the web page. Alternatively with regard to the second data it is shown that access to the web page was not possible until May 31 but since June 1 access to the web page has been possible. In other words it is indicated that provision of the web page on the web server with an IP address of 200.100.100.002 began on June 1. Furthermore according to the third data the web server with an IP address of 200.100.100.003 began providing the web page on May 3 but the web page has not been provided since May 4. Moreover the date from which to begin increasing decreasing the reliability degree would be June 1 in example of the second data .

The shows the flow of the contents collection process related to the present embodiment. An information search provision apparatus performs the following contents collection process once a day with respect to all of the IP addresses stored in the access history files. The access unit acquires the IP address S of the web server that is the target of collection of contents from access history files stored in the access history storage and accesses the web server . The access determining unit determines whether access by the access unit to the web server was possible and sets an x flag S in the column for the present date in the Access History column under the IP address when it is determined that access was not possible S N .

The access determining unit sets an o flag in a column of the present date in the Access History column under the IP address S when it is determined that access by the access unit was possible S Y . The time specifying unit sets the present date in the Web Page Provision Start Date column when it is determined that the present date is regarded as a web page provision start date S Y by referring to the access history files. The time specifying unit skips an action to set the present date in the web page provision start date when it is determined that the present date is not regarded as a web page provision start date S N .

When it was possible for the collecting unit to collect contents with the IP address posted on a web page on a web server S Y the collecting unit stores the contents in the Contents column in a searched information file S . Then the contents associated information are also stored. The history increase range controlling unit decreases the range of increase by 1 S when it is determined that access by the access unit was not possible on the day before the present date S Y by referring to the access history files while the reliability controlling unit increases the current reliability degree of the contents by the range of increase S . When the history increase range controlling unit determines that access by the access unit was not possible on the day before the present date by referring to the access history files S N the reliability controlling unit increases the current reliability degree of the contents by the range of increase S .

When the collection of contents posted on a web page of the IP address was not possible by the collecting unit S N the reliability controlling unit decreases the current reliability degree of the contents S . The collection controlling unit determines whether the contents collection process has finished with respect to the entire IP addresses in the access history files and when there is any IP address therein the contents collection process has not been finished yet S N then the contents collection process is performed with respect to the IP address. If finished the information search provision apparatus finishes the contents collection process on the day S Y .

In Embodiment 1 depending on whether it was possible to collect the contents to be evaluated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased. In Embodiment 2 in addition to results of the possibility impossibility of collection the result of the presence or absence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and contents having a high reliability degree is reflected by increasing or decreasing the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated. shows the configuration of an information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 2. For the same configuration as in the same symbols are given and the explanations are omitted as appropriate. The information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 2 is further equipped with a relationship determining unit that is a different configuration element from the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 shown in .

The relationship determining unit determines the presence or absence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and contents having a high reliability degree based on whether related information indicating the presence of the relationship between the contents to be evaluated and the contents having a high reliability degree is contained in the contents having a high reliability degree. Then to take an example the relationship determining unit determines related information such as a link from the contents having a high reliability degree to the contents to be evaluated is contained in the contents having a high reliability degree. More specifically the relationship determining unit determines whether the URL of the contents to be evaluated is contained in a tag of that is contained in the contents having a high reliability degree. As another example the relationship determining unit determines whether a link from the contents to be evaluated the URL of the web page on which the contents to be evaluated are posted or the name of the information provider of the web page are found in the Office Information column an Introductory Information column a Related Information column and a Reference Information column etc. belonging to the contents having a high reliability degree. Then the information is acquired from searched information files by the relationship determining unit .

The reliability controlling unit controls the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the presence of the relationship is determined by the relationship determining unit in a manner in which it is set higher than the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the absence of the relationship is determined. Accordingly the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated may be differentiated according to the case of whether a link to the contents to be evaluated is available in a highly reliable web page.

Among multiple sets of contents having a high reliability degree if there are URLs that match the URL of the contents to be evaluated the reliability controlling unit may increase the range of increase of the reliability degree by the number of matching contents having a high reliability degree. For instance within three sets of contents having a high reliability degree if there are URLs matching the URL of the contents to be evaluated 3 is further added to the current range of increase of the contents to be evaluated. Accordingly as more links from contents having a high reliability degree to the contents to be evaluated become available in greater number of sets of contents having a high reliability degree the range of increase of the reliability degree may be greater.

Furthermore among multiple sets of contents having a high reliability degree if a link from the contents to be evaluated the URL of the web page on which the contents to be evaluated is posted or the name of the information provider of the web page are included in the Office Information column the Introductory Information column the Related Information column and the Reference Information column in the contents the reliability controlling unit may increase the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated by the number of sets of contained contents having a high reliability degree. For example if the number of sets of contained contents having a high reliability degree is two 2 is further added to the current range of increase of the contents to be evaluated.

As information providers of contents having a high reliability degree are third parties from a view point of information providers of the contents to be evaluated in general the information providers of the contents to be evaluated may not be able to arbitrarily change the contents having a high reliability degree. Therefore if a link from contents having a high reliability degree to the contents to be evaluated or information introducing the contents to be evaluated etc. are posted in the contents having a high reliability degree that fact has to be respected. As described above the reliability controlling unit in the present embodiment controls the range of increase of the reliability degree in cases in which the above links or information are posted in a manner in which it is set higher than the range of increase of the reliability degree in cases in which they are not posted in order to differentiate them.

In Embodiment 1 depending on the possibility impossibility of collection of the contents to be evaluated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased. In Embodiment 3 the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased depending on whether the contents have been updated. shows the configuration of an information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 3. For the same configuration as in the same symbols are given and the explanations are omitted as appropriate. The information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 3 is further equipped with a comparison unit and an update determining unit as new configuration elements in place of a history increase range controlling unit of the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 shown in .

The comparison unit compares the contents to be evaluated collected by a collecting unit with next the contents to be evaluated to be collected from and posted on the same web page. In comparison the comparison unit refers to for example HTML language structure text images or programs etc. contained in both sets of contents. The comparison unit may internally comprise a displacement analysis unit not illustrated which analyzes the amount of displacement of HTML language structure text images or programs etc. The comparison unit may compare proprietary information to the web page such as the corporation name address and telephone number. When the corporation name address or telephone number posted on the previously collected contents have been changed without reason in the next collected contents the reliability controlling unit reduces the reliability degree of the contents.

The update determining unit determines whether the contents to be evaluated have been updated based on results of comparison by the comparison unit . Then the update determining unit determines that the contents to be evaluated have been updated when there are differences of for example more than a predetermined number of letters contained among the previously collected contents and the next collected contents. Furthermore even if the difference is a single letter the contents may be determined to have been updated.

To take HTML language structure as another example if a tag located in a specific position in the previously collected contents to be evaluated has been replaced with another tag or if a new tag has been inserted as an addition the update determining unit may determine that the contents to be evaluated have been updated. To take images as a further example when the photograph of a person in the contents is changed from ten years ago it may be determined that no update has been made. As a further example when there has been a break in text posted in a journal of contents or when no countermeasure has been taken for the inappropriate use of a bulletin board the update determining unit may determine that the contents to be evaluated has not been updated.

The reliability controlling unit increases or decreases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated according to a decision made by the update determining unit at a predetermined time herein once a day. In other words when the update determining unit determines that the contents to be evaluated have been updated and if the contents to be evaluated have been updated the reliability degree of the contents is gradually increased once a day during a period in which such determination is continuous. Alternatively when the update determining unit determines that the contents to be evaluated has not been updated and if the contents to be evaluated have not been updated the reliability degree of the contents is gradually decreased once a day during a period in which such determination is continuous.

According to the information search provision apparatus related to the present embodiment as more updates are made regularly in contents to be posted on a web page it is more likely that the reliability degree increases. By presenting the reliability degree of contents to users the users are able to easily ascertain the extent of the reliability degree of the contents. For instance users can shop comfortably from web pages of an Internet shopping service that have a high reliability degree. Alternatively the web page provider may get involved in an active update on a regular basis in order to enhance the reliability degree of their own contents. Thus it is more likely that the web pages existing on a network over all are to be further updated leading to the activation of the entire Internet.

In Embodiment 3 depending on whether the contents have been updated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased. In Embodiment 4 in addition to the result of whether the contents have been updated analysis results of whether an update of the contents is primarily required is reflected to increase or decrease the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated. shows the configuration of an information search provision apparatus related to the present Embodiment 4. For the same configuration as in the same symbols are given and the explanations are omitted as appropriate. In addition to the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 3 shown in the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 4 is further equipped with an update analysis unit as a new configuration element.

The update analysis unit refers to the contents to be evaluated that have been collected by a collecting unit and analyzes whether an update of the contents is primarily required. More specifically the update analysis unit classifies the contents to be evaluated into either a group primarily requiring updates or a group primarily not requiring updates . A group primarily requiring updates is a group of contents that would become significant by frequently updating the information including contents such as breaking news weather or diary. Alternatively a group primarily not requiring updates is a group of contents that would become significant by not updating the information including providing contents such as a politician s claims or the basic management policy of a company.

More specifically if a keyword such as news or weather that would become significant by frequent updates is contained in contents the update analysis unit classifies the contents into a group primarily requiring updates. Alternatively if a keyword such as claim or basic policy that would become significant without an update is contained in contents the contents are classified into a group primarily not requiring updates. Keywords for classifying contents into these groups provision apparatus related to Embodiment 4 is further equipped with an update analysis unit as a new configuration element.

The update analysis unit refers to the contents to be evaluated that have been collected by a collecting unit and analyzes whether an update of the contents is primarily required. More specifically the update analysis unit classifies the contents to be evaluated into either a group primarily requiring updates or a group primarily not requiring updates . A group primarily requiring updates is a group of contents that would become significant by frequently updating the information including contents such as breaking news weather or diary. Alternatively a group primarily not requiring updates is a group of contents that would become significant by not updating the information including providing contents such as a politician s claims or the basic management policy of a company.

More specifically if a keyword such as news or weather that would become significant by frequent updates is contained in contents the update analysis unit classifies the contents into a group primarily requiring updates. Alternatively if a keyword such as claim or basic policy that would become significant without an update is contained in contents the contents are classified into a group primarily not requiring updates. Keywords for classifying contents into these groups may be registered in the information search apparatus in advance.

The update analysis unit may classify a group primarily requiring updates further into a group requiring regular updates and a group not requiring regular updates. The update analysis unit analyzes whether the contents classified into a group requiring regular updates are updated regularly. A group requiring regular updates includes information related to the ages of people existing in reality and contents posting the images of their appearance. Ages of people existing in reality and appearances etc. continue changing so from an aspect of providing the latest information it is necessary to update information related to the ages of people existing in reality as well as images of appearances etc. regularly. Examples of contents of posted images of the appearance of people existing in reality include the images of portrait photos for arranged marriages hosted by a marriage agency facial images of executives posted on a company brochure and facial images of members belonged to a certain type of group etc. The fact that images of the appearance of people existing in reality have been updated is particularly useful when later meeting with the person in reality.

The reliability controlling unit increases or decreases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated according to decisions made by the update determining unit and analytical results of the update analysis unit . In other words contents to be evaluated are classified into a group primarily requiring updates and the reliability controlling unit increases the reliability degree of the contents when the update determining unit determines that the contents have been updated and decreases the reliability degree when it is determined that the contents have not been updated. Alternatively for the contents to be evaluated classified into a group primarily not requiring updates the reliability controlling unit increases the reliability degree when the update determining unit determines that the contents have not been updated and decreases the reliability degree when it is determined that the contents have been updated.

According to the present embodiment in addition to the presence or absence of updated contents by determining to increase or decrease the reliability degree based on whether the contents primarily require updates even if the contents have not been updated if the contents are not supposed to be primarily be updated the reliability degree may be increased thus saving the contents.

In Embodiment 3 depending on whether the contents to be evaluated have been updated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased. In Embodiment 5 an examination is performed of whether a link interruption has occurred in the contents when examining whether the contents have been updated. shows the configuration of an information search provision apparatus related to the present Embodiment 5. For the same configuration as in the same symbols are given and the explanations are omitted as appropriate. In addition to the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 3 shown in the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 5 is further equipped with a link interruption determining unit as a new configuration element.

The link interruption determining unit accesses the web page of the link destination stated in the contents to be evaluated collected by a collecting unit and determines whether any type of contents are posted on the web page. More specifically the link interruption determining unit accesses the web pages of other web servers by referring to in a tag contained in the contents to be evaluated. If there are multiple tags described above multiple web pages are accessed. Then when text such as Moved or FILE NOT FOUND is found it is determined that a link interruption has taken place. Alternatively if any type of contents such as contents containing text other than those described above are posted it is determined that a link interruption has not taken place.

Needless to say the link interruption determining unit may access the link destination on the same web page on the same web server or a link destination on a different web page on the same web server. Then the link interruption determining unit determines that a link interruption has occurred such as when an image or video data does not exist in the link destination.

The reliability controlling unit controls the increase or decrease in the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated according to decisions made by the link interruption determining unit . More specifically when it is determined that a link interruption has occurred the reliability controlling unit maintains the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated constantly during a period of time in which the link interruption has occurred. Furthermore in this case the reliability degree may be decreased. On the other hand if the contents to be evaluated are updated and the link interruption is resolved the reliability degree of the contents is increased.

According to the present embodiment by setting the reliability degree when there is a link interruption on a web page lower than the reliability degree when there is no link interruption the two may be differentiated. A link connecting a web page to another web page is one important element in the reason for the Internet to have been developed so it is significant to regard the presence or absence of a link interruption as an index to evaluate the reliability degree of contents. By presenting the reliability degree based on link interruptions users are enabled to use only contents having a high reliability degree without any link interruption. Alternatively the web page provider may actively get involved in fixing link interruptions in order to enhance the reliability degree of contents. Accordingly it is more likely that dead links existing on a network are more commonly fixed overall thus leading to enhanced quality of the entire web page.

In Embodiment 1 depending on whether it was possible to collect contents the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated is increased or decreased. In Embodiment 6 depending on elements contributing to the increase or decrease in the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased. shows the configuration of an information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 6. For the same configuration as in the same symbols are given and the explanations are omitted as appropriate. The information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 6 is further equipped with a related contents acquisition unit an element extracting unit and a classifying unit as new configuration elements in place of a history increase range controlling unit of the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 shown in .

The related contents acquisition unit acquires contents related to contents to be evaluated. For example a search unit performs a search by designating a search conditional statement such as a sentence ABC company contained in the contents to be evaluated and the related contents acquisition unit may regard contents that matches the search conditional statement as related contents hereinafter related contents . Then the search unit may acquire related contents from a search information storage or may acquire related contents using other search engines or web pages. The search conditional statement may be designated by a user via a terminal apparatus or be generated regularly with the use of a dictionary by a search conditional statement generating unit not illustrated in the search information provision apparatus . Furthermore related contents may also contain the contents themselves to be evaluated.

The element extracting unit extracts elements contributing to the increase or decrease in the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated among acquired contents. For example elements contributing to the increase in the reliability degree indicate keywords such as new product development patent acquisition new roll out increase in sales and profits etc. and elements contributing to the decrease in the reliability degree indicate keywords such as trial debt arrest profit reduction etc. All the keywords contributing to the increase or decrease in the reliability degree may be held in a contribution storage not illustrated in advance. Then the element extracting unit acquires keywords from the contribution storage and acquires matching information by designating these keywords with respect to the contents acquired by the related contents acquisition unit to perform a search.

The classifying unit classifies each element extracted by the element extracting unit into a first group contributing to the increase in the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated or into a second group contributing to the decrease of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated.

The reliability controlling unit increases or decreases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated by referring to the element extracted by the element extracting unit . More specifically the reliability controlling unit increases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the number of elements in the first group classified by the classifying unit is greater than the number of elements in the second group. Meanwhile the reliability controlling unit decreases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the number of elements in the second group is greater than the number of elements in the first group.

According to the present embodiment the information search provision apparatus is capable of increasing or decreasing the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated depending on how the contents to be evaluated have been evaluated by other web pages or contents. Then by considering not only the elements contributing to the increase in the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated but also the elements contributing to the decrease in the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated an evaluation accuracy of the reliability degree is enhanced.

In Embodiments 1 through 6 the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated is increased or decreased independently. In Embodiment 7 the reliability degree of the contents related to each other is controlled at the same time. shows the configuration of an information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 7. For the same configuration as in the same symbols are given and the explanations are omitted as appropriate. The information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 7 is further equipped with a contents acquisition unit an contents specifying unit and a consistency determining unit as new configuration elements in place of a history increase range controlling unit of the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 shown in .

The contents acquisition unit acquires contents containing an item to be assessed. The item to be assessed is data subject to determine consistency possibly for example address telephone number facsimile number hiring information financial information and the like. The recruitment related information indicates for example the number of people expected to be hired in the following year or the actual number of people hired this year and the finance related information indicates sales or current profit etc. Furthermore the data format of the item to be assessed may be any such as text data image data audio data or video data. The contents specifying unit specifies own contents serving as an information source of the item to be assessed from among acquired contents. Hereafter one example of determining criteria for specifying own contents will be shown. Needless to say the determining criteria may be composed of a combination of the following.

 3 Specify by referring to the search results acquired from other web pages search engines or databases

In the case of 1 the contents specifying unit determines by referring to the URL of the acquired contents for example when the item to be assessed is a telephone number of a specific corporation whether the URL contains a domain name abc of the corporation if one is not contained it is determined that the contents are own contents. Then the access unit may acquire the domain name of the corporation by accessing the database of a third party organization that is managing the domain name.

In the case of 2 the contents specifying unit determines own contents by referring to the contents of the acquired contents for example when the item to be assessed is a telephone number of a specific corporation and whether the title area of the contents for example the region surrounded by tags contains the name of the corporation.

In the case of 3 the contents specifying unit determines the contents located at the top most as own contents among the search results obtained from other web pages search engines or database by designating the item to be assessed as a search conditional statement. In the case of 4 the contents specifying unit determines the contents having the most number of links linked from other contents as own contents by referring to a tag in the contents.

In the case of 5 the contents specifying unit determines the contents with the earliest provision start date as own contents by referring to the web page provision start date related to the acquired contents.

The consistency determining unit determines the consistency or lack thereof of items to be assessed in a manner in which the own contents specified by the contents specifying unit is compared with contents in the acquired contents other than the own contents.

The reliability controlling unit increases or decreases the reliability degree of own contents and the reliability degree of other contents according to the decision made by the consistency determining unit . In other words when both the reliability degree of the own contents and the reliability degree of the other contents are high and the items to be assessed are determined by the consistency determining unit to be consistent the reliability controlling unit increases the reliability degree of the own contents as well as the reliability degree of the other contents. When both the reliability degree of the own contents and the reliability degree of the other contents is high and the lack of consistency is determined the reliability controlling unit decreases the reliability degree of both. Then the information search provision apparatus may comprise a notifying unit not illustrated and may issue an alert of a correction indication of the item to be assessed to the information provider of the web pages posting each contents.

While the reliability degree of the own contents are high and the reliability degree of the other contents is low and when it is determined that it is consistent the reliability controlling unit raises the reliability degree of the other contents. However the reliability degree of own contents is not to be neither increased nor decreased. Furthermore while the reliability degree of the own contents is high and the reliability degree of the other contents is low and when it is determined that there is a lack of consistency the reliability controlling unit lowers the reliability degree of the other contents. However the reliability degree of own contents is not be neither increased nor decreased. In other words because the contents of the other contents with a low reliability degree is not reliable in the first place the reliability controlling unit controls the reliability degree of own contents so as to not be influenced by the same.

The other contents may be contents provided by public or highly public agencies. The public or highly public agencies indicated here are for example agencies run by a nation a local municipality or a third party organization. Because the reliability degree of the contents provided by these agencies is generally high the consistency determining unit may increase the reliability degree of the own contents for example for the telephone number or address when it is determined that there is consistency between the own contents and the other contents.

In general there is some contents containing fallacies or mistakes within the contents. Therefore it is significant to determine consistency or the lack thereof with respect to contents sent by information providers and contents posted in other contents or web pages. Due to the information search provision apparatus related to the present embodiment by being notified of the reliability degree of contents based on consistency or lack thereof users are able to use only contents having a high reliability degree that is less likely to contain fallacies or mistakes in the contents. Alternatively the web page provider may actively fix fallacies or mistakes in order to enhance the reliability degree of the contents. Accordingly it is highly probable that fallacies or mistakes of contents overall are more likely to be fixed when seen overall thereby leading to the quality enhancement of the entire web page.

The information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 8 comprises configuration elements to realize functions related to Embodiment 1 Embodiment 3 Embodiment 5 Embodiment 6 and Embodiment 7. Then the reliability degree realized by the configuration elements related to each embodiment is kept in a Reliability column within a searched information file as a respectively different reliability degree. Furthermore the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 8 may comprise configuration elements to realize functions related to Embodiment 2 in place of configuration elements to realize functions related to Embodiment 1 and configuration elements to realize functions related to Embodiment 4 in place of configuration elements to realize functions in Embodiment 3.

The reliability table is comprised of five tables a first through fifth reliability table through . Herein the first reliability table is the reliability degree table related to the continuity of the involved in Embodiment 1 or Embodiment 2 the second reliability table is the reliability degree table related to an update status of the contents involved in Embodiment 3 or Embodiment 4 the third reliability table is the reliability degree table related to the link destination status of contents involved in Embodiment 5 the fourth reliability table is the reliability degree table related to an evaluation from other contents with respect to the contents involved in Embodiment 6 the fifth reliability table is the reliability degree table in which the results of these first to fourth reliability tables through are summarized. A point A in five the first through fifth reliability tables through indicates the current reliability degree of the contents.

The list region comprises a first list region storing a list of other web pages in which a favorable evaluation is given with respect to the searched contents and a second list region storing a list of other web pages in which an unfavorable evaluation is given with respect to the searched contents. More specifically the contents contributing to the increase or decrease in the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated are displayed among contents acquired by a related contents acquisition unit involved in Embodiment 6. As shown a list of web pages posting contents containing keywords that increase the reliability degree of searched contents is stored in the first list region and a list of web pages posting contents containing keywords that decrease the reliability degree of searched contents is stored in the second list region .

The reliability ranking table includes an item column and a rank column . The table shows the reliability degree to be controlled as results of the decision regarding consistency made by a configuration element related to Embodiment 7. The reliability ranking table includes said items to be assessed such as address telephone number facsimile number or recruitment related information etc. For the information included in the rank column the reliability degree of contents is classified into several categories according to degree and are shown in alphabetical form. For example rank A indicates a high reliability degree after which the order of the reliability degree decreases shown as B C and D in an alphabetical order.

According to the present embodiment by presenting the reliability degree of contents from multiple aspects to users such as from the aspect of continuity of the contents or an update status of the contents the users are able to ascertain the reliability degree of contents from various aspects. Particularly the reliability degree of overall evaluation is a summary of degrees of reliability from multiple aspects and is thereby excellent in terms of balance so users are able to ascertain far more reliable evaluation results related to the contents.

In Embodiment 1 the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased depending on whether it is possible to collect the contents to be evaluated. In Embodiment 9 in addition to whether it was possible to collect the contents to be evaluated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased based on client information associated with a network terminal apparatus that is accessed via a network of the contents. Cited as client information are information related to the status of access to the contents from said network terminal apparatus and information entered into the contents from said network terminal apparatus.

The contents acquisition unit acquires contents provided by a web server via a network . More specifically from a WWW browser to be installed on the network terminal apparatus not illustrated an acquisition request of the contents provided by the web server is sent. Responding to the contents acquisition request the contents sent from the web server is taken into the network terminal apparatus and displayed on the WWW browser. The date and time when the contents were acquired by the contents acquisition unit or the number of contents acquisitions etc. are saved in the network terminal apparatus as access status log data such as cookies and the like.

The terminal information storage stores information related to the network terminal apparatus . As example of information held in the terminal information storage cited are information related to the acquired date and time of contents obtainable from cookies the number of contents acquisitions information related to a bypassed URL when contents were acquired information related to the operating system hereinafter OS of the network terminal apparatus information related to the browser used in the network terminal apparatus and information related to the Internet service provider hereinafter ISP that the network terminal apparatus is using.

The information transmitting unit sends client information associated with the network terminal apparatus to the web server . Practical examples of the client information sent by the information transmitting unit are information related to the acquired date and the time of contents the number of contents acquisitions and the OS information related to ISP etc. as described above. Furthermore as described later if the contents provided by a contents provision unit contains a contents of product sales using the Internet the information transmitting unit sends information such as the name of the purchaser of the product the product name the unit price of the purchasing product and the volume to the web server as client information.

The contents provision unit provides contents in response to requests from the network terminal apparatus . Contents provided by the contents provision unit may be contents intended to browse news blogs images moving pictures etc. or contents related to product sales using the Internet. The contents provision unit is suited for providing contents in which an instruction program written in JavaScript etc. is embedded to send and receive information from the web server when the network terminal apparatus browses contents or enters any type of information with respect to the contents in order to realize the transmission of the client information from the information transmitting unit described above.

When entering any type of information with respect to contents such as an input form composed of textboxes or radio buttons etc. created by a CGI program etc. may be used.

The access detecting unit detects access to the contents by the network terminal apparatus such that the network terminal apparatus browses the contents or that any type of information has been entered from the network terminal apparatus with respect to the contents.

The input information receiver receives input information from the network terminal apparatus with respect to the contents. For example if the contents provided by the contents provision unit are on a web page for product sales using the Internet the input information receiver receives information such as the name of the purchaser of the product the product name the unit price of the purchasing product and the volume.

The information acquisition unit acquires information related to the acquired date and time of the contents the number of contents acquisitions the OS and information related to the ISP transmitted from the information transmitting unit of the network terminal apparatus .

The information transmitting unit sends obtained client information to the information search provision apparatus .

The information receiver receives information sent from the information transmitting unit of the web server to be stored in the received information storage . When continuing to be accessed from the network terminal apparatus it is received as client information in a series of accesses.

Examples of client information related to access history are the access date time when the network terminal apparatus accessed the contents the access source IP address assigned to the network terminal apparatus the bypassing URL held in the network terminal apparatus the OS information used in the network terminal apparatus and the like.

Examples of client information related to input data are the purchasing amount the product name and the user name etc. automatically entered into a form for purchasing a product that has been set in the contents by the network terminal apparatus .

To return to the explanation of the configuration of the information receiving end determining unit determines whether information has continued to be received in order to determine when a series of accesses ended. For example whether information has continued to be received is determined based on whether the interval between receiving information from the same network terminal apparatus is within a predetermined period.

The information analysis unit analyzes information stored in the received information storage based on analysis conditions influencing the reliability degree held in the analysis condition storage . The reliability controlling unit increases or decreases the reliability degree stored in a search information storage in accordance with the analysis results. It is preferable to store said analysis conditions in the analysis condition storage in advance but updates may appropriately be made when necessary.

For instance if a condition is set in the analysis condition storage as in case of an access from the same network terminal apparatus set the reliability degree higher than that in the first access the information analysis unit analyzes whether the access is from the same network terminal apparatus by referring in the received information storage to information received in the past held. If the access is from the same network terminal apparatus the reliability controlling unit raises the reliability degree higher than an access from a different network terminal apparatus .

When the network terminal apparatus browses the contents examples of factors that increase the reliability degree of contents include increased accesses to the contents from the network terminal apparatus accesses through sites with a high reliability degree and accesses to contents from a network terminal apparatus using an OS with a high reliability degree. On the other hand examples of decreased reliability degree of the contents include decreased accesses to the contents from the network terminal apparatus accesses through sites with a low reliability degree and accesses to the contents from a network terminal apparatus using an OS with a low reliability degree. For the reliability degree of the site information held in the search information storage is to be referenced. Other than these the reliability degree of the contents may be increased or decreased based on the type of browser or program used in the network terminal apparatus the updated version the presence or absence of countermeasures against vulnerabilities the existence or lack of possibility that other sites may be harmed and the reliability degree of the ISP that the network terminal apparatus is using etc.

Examples of factors that increase the reliability degree of the contents when the network terminal apparatus enters any type of information with respect to the contents include when the network terminal apparatus uses the contents for shopping and the same network terminal apparatus uses the contents for multiple instances of shopping. Using contents for shopping may be considered proof that the network terminal apparatus uses the contents reliably. Therefore as more network terminal apparatuses engage in shopping the reliability degree of the contents may also be increased or decreased. Furthermore cases in which the same network terminal apparatus using contents for multiple instances of shopping are determined as a regular customer of the contents it may be considered that the more regular the contents is the higher the reliability degree that the contents becomes.

Moreover when the network terminal apparatus uses the contents for shopping and when payment is made by credit card it is determined to be an access from a user with a higher reliability degree. Then by judging whether the purchase involves the use of a credit card based on the client information related to the input data the reliability degree of the contents may be set higher as more network terminal apparatuses carry out shopping using credit cards. The fact that a credit card is being used is one example of the capability of identifying a user who uses the network terminal apparatus . As long as the method is capable of identifying the identity of the user it does not have to be limited to the use of a credit card.

The client identifying unit confirms whether the user of the contents held in the received information storage matches any of the latest user names held in the received information storage .

The regular customer frequency of use controlling unit increases the frequency of use by the regular customer held in the search information storage when a match is confirmed by the client identifying unit .

For example in the contents of http 1 when information such as Taro Yamazaki purchased product A101 at 29 600 yen is stored in the received information storage the corresponding total purchasing amount of the contents http 1 in the search information storage would be 279 600 yen by adding 29 600 yen to 250 000 yen. Furthermore if product A101 has been evaluated as 5 which is the highest rank in the evaluation of five levels for a food product not influenced by trends the total product property evaluation would be 11 by adding 5 to 6. Furthermore if Taro Yamazaki has a purchase history of 3 times in the contents of http 1 in the past the regular customer frequency of use would be 23 by adding 3 to 20. 

The transaction evaluating unit acquires the latest purchasing amount and the product name held in the received information storage . The transaction evaluating unit seeks the payment size or the transaction contents in the contents by acquiring the payment amount or the product information entered during the shopping. The reliability controlling unit may increase or decrease the reliability degree based on the payment size or the transaction contents in the contents. Furthermore the transaction evaluating unit may perform an evaluation based on the product properties such as the trend of product name product type etc. In this case it is preferable to prepare the criteria for the product property evaluation in advance.

For instance if the payment amount within a month in the contents exceeds a predetermined amount dealing with products not influenced by trends and having many regular customers the reliability controlling unit may greatly increase the reliability degree.

The transaction evaluation update unit updates the total purchasing amount and the total product property evaluation held in the search information storage following the process of transaction evaluating unit .

As described above by collecting information related to a payment in the contents the transaction of the contents or the asset value of the contents may be calculated.

The asset value calculating unit calculates the profit in a transaction by acquiring the latest purchasing amount and the product name held in the received information storage as well as by acquiring the cost of the product from a sales management system not illustrated or an accounting system not illustrated where data related to the contents are stored. By considering the figure of the profit totaled during a certain period the frequency of use of regular customers and the property of the product and by estimating a future profit the asset value of the contents are calculated.

The asset value update unit updates an asset value held in the search information storage based on the asset value calculated by the asset value calculating unit .

For instance when seeking an asset value of contents containing http 1 if the annual profit is 100 million yen the regular customer frequency of use is 20 and the total product property evaluation is 6 then it is estimated that the profit will continue for the next 3 years based on the regular customer frequency of use and the total product property evaluation. From this the asset value of the contents are calculated as 300 million yen. Furthermore it is preferable to prepare a standard for calculating the profit calculation period based on the regular customer frequency of use and the total product property evaluation in advance.

The shows the process flow of the increase decrease in the reliability degree related to the present embodiment. First the information search provision apparatus is in standby mode for receiving information transmitted from the web server . When the information receiver receives client information S the received client information is stored in the received information storage S .

By the information receiving end decision S while continuously receiving the information S Y the received client information continues to be stored. However based on the condition that a predetermined period of time has elapsed after receiving the client information from the network terminal apparatus for the first time it is allowed to proceed to the information analysis step S .

On the other hand when the information receiving end determining unit determines that information has not continued to be received S N then an information analysis S is performed by the information analysis unit . When the information analysis unit has determined that the reliability degree increases decreases S Y an increasing decreasing process of the reliability degree S is carried out by the reliability controlling unit and then the process ends. Alternatively when the information analysis unit determines that there has been no influence on the reliability degree S N the process ends.

According to the present embodiment with the information held in the network terminal apparatus using contents control of the reliability degree becomes possible. Furthermore by collecting the payment information between the network terminal apparatus and the contents calculation of the asset value of the contents becomes possible. On a network particularly on the Internet various contents are run regardless of whether it is by for corporations or individuals and there is a large number of beneficial contents existing among them. However the history of running contents are minimal and such methods used in evaluating land or buildings existing in reality have not been established. Along with a calculation of the reliability degree calculation of asset value of the contents are expected to be the foundation of a new system or in other words the logistics of contents besides being useful for smoothly performing a transfer or an inheritance of contents owned by an individual the succession or transfer of contents owned by a corporation or a merger and absorption of a corporation that owns further beneficial contents and investments or loans to said corporation etc.

Furthermore in Embodiment 9 although the client information of the network terminal apparatus is delivered to the information search provision apparatus via a web server the client information of the network terminal apparatus may directly be delivered to the information search provision apparatus . In addition the client information of the network terminal apparatus may be delivered to the information search provision apparatus via an information collection apparatus run by a third party. In addition the information search provision apparatus may serve as a web server to provide contents.

In Embodiment 3 depending on whether the contents to be evaluated have been updated the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated is increased or decreased. In Embodiment 10 with regard to decision items related to a provider of contents to be evaluated the publication circumstances of the contents to be evaluated and of compared contents respectively are acquired and by comparing the publication circumstance of decision items in the contents to be evaluated with the publication circumstance of decision items in the compared contents it is determined whether the contents to be evaluated is properly assessed. More specifically the decision items related to the provider of the contents to be evaluated consist of event information publicized by the organizers who run the contents to be evaluated and the like.

In general when any type of event is publicized the event information would be posted not only in the contents to be evaluated run by the organizers themselves but also be posted in contents other than the contents to be evaluated that is not run by the organizer. Examples of information sources to be posted in contents other than the contents to be evaluated include the contents to be evaluated when bypassing a network a press conference and an independent report etc. when the network is not bypassed. Herein in spite of the fact that an event information is not posted in the contents to be evaluated when the event information is posted in contents other than the contents to be evaluated or when the event information has been posted in contents other than the contents to be evaluated prior to posting in the contents to be evaluated it is determined that the contents to be evaluated is not appropriately updated.

In the present invention event information is publicized by the organizers but not only that the event information may be publicized by a third party other the organizers. For example there are some cases in which fraud or social wrongdoings of organizers is posted in contents run by a third party to be publicized without being publicized by the organizers themselves. In such a case when event information such as fraud etc. of an organizer is posted in contents run by a third party depending on whether an appropriate comment or an apology etc. regarding the event information is posted in the contents run by the organizer it is determined whether the contents run by the organizer have been updated appropriately.

Herein a posting in the event organizer s own contents indicates posting of an event generated by the contents organizers themselves in their own contents. An independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents indicates that the generated event has been posted in other contents by an independent report etc. before being posted in the own contents. A web page generated after having been posted in the own contents indicates that the generated event has been posted in other contents after having been posted in the own contents by referring to the posted contents. An independent report generated after having been posted in the own contents indicates that the generated event has been posted in other contents by an independent report etc. after having been posted in the own contents.

To return to an explanation of the configuration of the event extracting unit analyzes accumulated contents as needed and extracts events. For instance information such as A new release of product X from company A on February 4 is extracted as an event.

The event organizer s contents identifying unit identifies the event organizer s contents by referring to the contents organizer in stored in a search information storage when the event extracting unit extracts an event. If the identified contents contains A new release of product X from company A on February 4 it is clear that company A is the organizer of the event. If company A is found in the contents organizer the information related to contents run by company A may be acquired. Furthermore the contents organizer of the acquired contents may be identified by comparing the URL and the URL column of the acquired contents. For instance when the URL http 1 a.html of the contents to be analyzed A new release of product X from company A on February 4 has been posted therein as containing a URL http 1 of company A it is regarded that an event organized by company A has been posted in company A s own contents. Alternatively when the URL of the contents to be analyzed A new release of product X from company A on February 4 has been posted therein is http 3 c.html as containing a URL of group X http it is regarded that an event organized by the group A has been posted in group X s own contents. Furthermore by referring to the contents information source the information source of the contents from the contents organizer may also be identified. In the case above the information source of the contents of group X is from an independent report. 

The contents information source determining unit is used to establish the value of the contents information source shown in .

The event generation request unit requests a contents organizer hereinafter referred to as a contents organizer generating the event held in a search information storage to generate an event to be publicized without being posted on a web page or an event to be publicized by being posted only on a web page. Such a request is presumed to have been agreed upon in advance with the contents organizer generating the event. The contents organizer generating the event publicizes an event according to the requested method and transmits the event information to the generated event receiver . For example in it is clear that an event generated by company D which is the contents organizer generating the event expected number of recruits to be hired is announced to be 500 people is an event to be publicized without being posted on a web page.

The generated event receiver receives said generated event information to be held in the requested information storage . Afterwards the event monitoring unit monitors whether the event stored in the requested information storage has been extracted by the event extracting unit . When an event that is to be publicized without being posted on a web page is extracted the information source of the contents of the contents organizer is determined to be an independent report. Alternatively when an event that is to be publicized by being posted only on a web page is extracted the information source of the contents of the contents organizer is determined to be a web page.

The contents information source controlling unit stores results monitored by the event monitoring unit in the corresponding contents information source in held in a search information storage . In addition values may be entered for the contents information source according to research based on auditing the contents operators.

The event generation controlling unit extracts events and stores data shown in in the event storage after identifying the event organizer the contents organizer who has posted the event and the contents information source. If there is an identical event in the event storage the event generation controlling unit increases the value of corresponding items among items related to the event including a posting in the event organizer s own contents an independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents a web page generated after having been posted in the own contents and an independent report generated after having been posted in the own contents . If there is no identical event a record is added as a new event then the event and the event organizer are entered. Furthermore a is entered into either the posting in the event organizer s own contents or the independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents whichever corresponds most closely. Normally for an event after a certain period of time the number of appearances are considered to be decreased. Therefore after a certain period of time following the first time when an event is generated when the event is extracted the unit may do nothing.

The update appropriateness determining unit determines whether an event organizer s own contents are updated appropriately by referring to the event storage .

For instance when an event shown in is September 6 announcement of expected number of recruits to be hired company W and the event organizer is company W it indicates that the posting in the organizer s own contents are 0 and the independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents are 10. It is determined as not having been posted in the own contents even though it had been posted in other contents. In this case it is determined that an appropriate update has not been made. Likewise when an event is February 6 Mr. R. Kagoshima s visit company A and the event organizer is company A it indicates that the posting in the organizer s own contents are 1 the independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents are 5 the web page generated after having been posted in the own contents are 6 and the independent report generated after having been posted in the own contents are 8. This can be determined as even though it had been posted in the own contents the posting in the own contents were delayed due to the prior posting in the other contents. Furthermore in this case it is determined that an appropriate update has not been made. However for values such as an independent report generated prior to the posting in the own contents it may be determined depending on whether the appropriate update has been made when exceeding the threshold value. An example in which the update has been made appropriately in one in which the event is February 4 a new release of product X company A and the event organizer is company A . In this case after having been posted in the own contents the event was posted in other contents. In this case it is determined that an appropriate update has not been made. Even in such a case if the independent report generated after having been posted in the own contents are 0 or extremely low then it is determined that the event is not important enough to be picked up as contents for an independent report so as to whether the update is appropriate it may be treated as being undetermined.

In the present embodiment a means for determining whether the contents have been appropriately updated is to observe how an event generated by an organizer of the contents to be evaluated proliferates its own contents which is the contents to be evaluated or to other contents. When this is accomplished those who run the contents will try to update information on a timely basis and moreover contribute to enhancement of the reliability degree of the contents.

Furthermore in the present embodiment even if an event requested from the event generation request unit is independent both an event that is to be publicized without being posted on a web page and an event that is to be publicized by being posted only on a web page may be requested from the event generation request unit at the same time. In this case it is preferable that the types of both events be similar. Moreover the same time includes not only the same day but also a range of several days or a few weeks.

Accordingly by regarding the way in which information related to an event that is to be publicized by being posted only on a web page spreads to other contents in the standard way that information related to any type of event spreads to other contents based on that standard the way in which information related to an event that is to be publicized without being posted on a web page spreads to other contents may be evaluated.

For instance the period from when an event is posted only on a web page and is publicized until it is posted in other contents and the way in which the number of other contents posting the event increases as time elapses may be regarded as an evaluation standard for the manner of spreading to other contents. If the way the information related to an event that is to be publicized without being posted on a web page spreads to other contents are the same as or similar to the evaluation standard it is determined that the event that has been publicized without being posted on a web page was posted in the own contents shortly after having been publicized.

Furthermore if an event that is to be publicized without being posted on a web page is extracted after the second access of other contents an event that is similar to the type of event that is to be publicized without being posted on a web page and that is to be publicized by being posted only on a web page at the same time is either posted in the other contents extracted after the second one or was posted in the past it may be assumed that the information source of the other contents extracted after the second one is other contents in which the event that is to be publicized without being posted on a web page has been posted for the first time or in other words from a web page. Alternatively if an event that is to be publicized by being posted only on a web page is not posted in other contents extracted after the second one nor was it posted in the past it may be assumed that the information source of the other contents extracted after the second one is from an independent report.

In Embodiment 1 depending on whether it was possible to collect contents to be evaluated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased. In Embodiment 11 in addition to the results of the possibility impossibility of the collection the identity of the contents to be evaluated collected at different timings is determined and the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated is increased or decreased according to the determination. shows the configuration of an information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 11. For the same configuration as in the same symbols are given and the explanations are omitted as appropriate. In addition to the configuration of the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 shown in the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 11 further comprises an identity determining unit .

The identity determining unit determines the identity of the contents to be evaluated collected at different timings. More specifically when determining the identity of the contents to be evaluated the contents to be evaluated would be newly collected by a collecting unit . The identity determining unit determines whether the identity of the contents to be evaluated is maintained by comparing the contents to be evaluated collected in the past and stored in a Contents column in a search information storage with the contents to be evaluated newly collected.

A reliability controlling unit increases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the identity determining unit determines that the identity of the contents to be evaluated is maintained. Alternatively the reliability controlling unit may decrease the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the identity determining unit determines that the identity of the contents to be evaluated is not maintained. Accordingly a web page for example in which the identity of the contents are maintained may be differentiated from a web page in which the identity of the contents are not maintained.

Furthermore the identity determining unit does not have to make a complete match between the contents to be evaluated collected in the past and the contents of the newly collected contents to be evaluated as a condition for an identity. For instance in contents such as a blog or news there are cases in which new items are added one after another to items posted in the past. In such a case even if the contents to be evaluated collected at an earlier time is determined to be identical to part of the contents to be evaluated collected at a subsequent time the identity determining unit may determine that the identity is maintained. Accordingly even in a case in which the contents to be evaluated collected at an earlier time is included as part of the contents to be evaluated collected at a subsequent time and at the same time the identity of the contents to be evaluated collected at an earlier time is maintained the reliability degree is increased.

In Embodiment 1 depending on whether it was possible to collect contents to be evaluated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased. In Embodiment 12 in addition to results of the possibility impossibility of the collection the uniqueness of the contents to be evaluated is determined depending on the determination the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated is increased or decreased. shows the configuration of an information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 12. For the same configuration as in the same symbols are given and the explanations are omitted as appropriate. In addition to the configuration of the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 shown in the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 12 further comprises a registering unit for comparing contents a contents comparison storage and a uniqueness determining unit .

The registering unit for comparing contents receives unique contents such as images moving pictures text audio data and programs etc. for comparing contents to be registered in the contents comparison storage . It is preferable that the compared contents already be copyrighted. In the present embodiment when registering contents information on the registrant of the contents and the rights holder of the contents would also be registered together.

The uniqueness determining unit determines the uniqueness of the contents to be evaluated by comparing the contents to be evaluated with the compared contents that had already been collected at the time when the contents to be evaluated was collected. The uniqueness determining unit examines whether the contents to be evaluated has already been registered by referring to the contents comparison storage . If the contents to be evaluated has not been registered in the contents comparison storage it is determined that the contents to be evaluated is highly unique.

Furthermore even if the contents to be evaluated has not been registered in the contents comparison storage when it is determined that the contents to be evaluated is a partial modification of contents registered in the contents comparison storage the uniqueness determining unit may determine that the contents to be evaluated is low in terms of uniqueness. Whether or not the contents to be evaluated is a partial modification of contents registered in the contents comparison storage may be determined for example by quantifying the similarities between the contents to be evaluated and the contents registered in the contents comparison storage based on a predetermined standard depending on whether the obtained figure is above the standard value.

The reliability controlling unit increases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the uniqueness determining unit determines that the uniqueness of the contents to be evaluated is high. Alternatively the reliability controlling unit may decrease the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the uniqueness determining unit determines that the contents to be evaluated is a modification of other contents. Furthermore even if the contents to be evaluated is a modification of other contents if the rights holder in the contents comparison storage and the provider of the contents to be evaluated are the same it is not necessary to lower the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated. Accordingly a web page for example containing contents that is highly unique may be differentiated from a web page containing contents that is low in terms of uniqueness.

In Embodiment 1 depending on whether it was possible to collect contents to be evaluated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased. It has already been mentioned that the reliability degree of the contents run by an information provider also corresponds to the reliability degree of other systems run by the same. In Embodiment 13 the reliability degree of location information for the contents are obtained in accordance with the reliability degree of the contents. For the location information of the contents the URL of the contents and a domain name further extracted from said URL is given as a practical example. In addition if an IP address assigned for the domain name is fixed the reliability degree of the IP address is obtained by relating the IP address and the reliability degree of the contents. Furthermore the reliability degree of the electronic mail address is obtained by relating the reliability degree of an electronic mail address containing the domain name and the reliability degree of the contents. By obtaining the reliability degree of an individual domain name or of an IP address the reliability degree of each group classified by predetermined attributes with respect to the domain name or the IP address is obtained.

The location information extracting unit extracts the domain name from a URL held in a search information storage to be stored in a search information storage . For example the location information extracting unit extracts the domain name abc.co.jp from the URL http www.abc.co.jp a.html. shows an example of the data structure of searched information files stored in the search information storage . The search information storage in the present embodiment includes an extracted domain name in addition to the configuration shown in . The domain name extracted from the location information extracting unit is written into a column of the extracted domain name .

The reliability transform unit includes a domain name reliability transform unit an electronic mail address reliability transform unit and an IP address reliability transform unit .

The domain name reliability transform unit calculates the reliability degree of a domain name based on the reliability degree of contents to be stored in the location information reliability storage . Principally the reliability degree of a domain name is obtained directly from the reliability degree of contents. However information other than the reliability degree of contents may be added to calculate the reliability degree of a domain name. For example information such as a group owning the domain name or domain attributes or the unjustified use of a domain name may be added to calculate the reliability degree of a domain name.

To calculate the reliability degree of a domain name may be considered an equivalent of calculating the reliability degree of an electronic mail address containing the domain name. Hence the electronic mail address reliability transform unit calculates the reliability degree of a domain name contained in an electronic mail address based on the reliability degree of the contents to be stored in the location information reliability storage . Principally the reliability degree of an electronic mail address matches the reliability degree of the domain name obtained from the reliability degree of contents. However information other than the reliability degree of contents may be added for the calculation. The reliability degree of an electronic mail address may be calculated by adding information other than contents such as the domain name used for unsolicited spam messages etc.

Furthermore the reliability degree of a domain name may be considered equivalent to the reliability degree of an IP address assigned to the domain name. Hence the IP address reliability transform unit calculates the reliability degree of a domain name based on the reliability degree of contents the calculated reliability degree is stored in the location information reliability storage as the reliability degree of an IP address assigned to the domain name. Principally the reliability degree of an IP address matches the reliability degree of the domain name. However information other than the reliability degree of contents may be added to calculate the reliability degree of a domain name. For example the reliability degree of an IP address may be calculated by adding information such as spamming due to the server to which the IP address has been assigned or a security vulnerability of the server etc.

The group reliability calculating unit includes a domain name type classifying unit a domain name type reliability calculating unit an ISP classifying unit and an ISP reliability calculating unit .

The domain name type classifying unit further extracts the domain name according to type such as com co.jp etc. from a domain name extracted from a URL held in a search information storage to be stored in the search information storage . As shown in with the search information storage of the present embodiment the domain name type has been further added as a data column. The domain name type extracted by the domain name type classifying unit is written into a column of the domain name type .

The domain name reliability calculating unit calculates the reliability degree per domain type such as com co.jp etc. to be stored in the location information reliability storage . For instance if the domain name reliability of a .com domain is 300 300 and 200 respectively 300 300 200 3 267 is obtained.

The ISP classifying unit acquires information related to a corresponding ISP from an IP Address column stored in a search information storage to be stored in the search information storage by referring to the group information storage . shows an example of an IP address information table stored in the group information storage . The IP address information table shown in includes an IP address a registry in charge by nation being in charge of each IP address and an ISP in charge being in charge of each ISP. Furthermore information on IP addresses to be stored in the group information storage and the associated ISP in charge etc. is capable of being added or corrected when necessary by a grouping information input unit not illustrated .

When the ISP classifying unit extracts information on the ISP in charge corresponding to one IP address to be stored in the search information storage by referring to the ISP in charge corresponding to the IP address in reference to the IP address information table shown in . As shown in in the search information storage of the present embodiment an ISP in charge has been further added as a data column. The ISPs extracted by the ISP classifying unit are written into a column of the ISP in charge . The search information storage may also store information in a relevant registry corresponding to the IP address name of the server etc.

The ISP reliability calculating unit calculates the reliability degree per ISP to be stored in the location information reliability storage by referring to the search information storage . For example if the reliability degree of an IP address of company A as the ISP is 600 200 and 80 respectively the reliability degree of the ISP is obtained by 600 200 80 3 293.

The location information reliability storage contains degrees of reliability related to the location of contents such as the reliability degree per domain name or IP address the reliability degree per domain name type and the reliability degree per ISP in charge etc.

The shows an example of a reliability table mapped to a domain name and an IP address. The reliability table shown in includes an IP address an extracted domain name the domain name reliability the electronic mail address reliability and the IP address reliability . By referring to the Reliability degree table shown in it is possible to extract the domain name reliability the electronic mail address reliability or the IP address reliability corresponding to a particular IP address or extracted domain name .

A search conditional statement entered into a terminal apparatus by a user is acquired by a search condition acquisition unit of an information search provision apparatus . A search condition analysis unit analyzes whether an acquired search conditional statement contains a domain name an electronic mail address or an IP address.

Whether a search conditional statement contains a domain name is determined depending on whether the search conditional statement satisfies the configuration format of the domain name. For instance when a search conditional statement meets the following conditions it is determined that the search conditional statement contains a domain name.

Whether or not a search conditional statement contains an electronic mail address is determined depending on whether the search conditional statement satisfies the configuration format of an electronic mail address. For instance if the search conditional statement is x y.z x is a series of any letters or numerals y.z is a domain name matching the conditions above it is determined that the search conditional statement contains an electronic mail address.

Furthermore whether or not a search conditional statement contains an IP address is determined depending on whether the search conditional statement satisfies the configuration format of an IP address. For instance if the search conditional statement falls in a range of 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 it is determined that the search conditional statement contains an IP address.

When the search condition analysis unit determines that a search conditional statement contains a domain name a search unit searches information matching the domain name of the search conditional statement from extracted domain names by referring to searched information files stored in a search information storage . A search results provision unit provides as the search results a list of information obtained from the search to a terminal apparatus . Then a reliability presentation unit presents to the terminal apparatus the domain name reliability corresponding to the extracted domain name by referring to .

When the search condition analysis unit determines that a search conditional statement contains an electronic mail address the search unit searches information matching the domain name contained in an electronic mail address of the search conditional statement from extracted domain names by referring to searched information files stored in the search information storage . The search results provision unit provides as the search results a list of information obtained from the search to the terminal apparatus . Then the reliability presentation unit presents to the terminal apparatus the electronic mail address reliability corresponding to the extracted domain name by referring to .

When the search condition analysis unit determines that a search conditional statement contains an IP address the search unit searches information matching the IP address of the search conditional statement from an IP Address column by referring to searched information files stored in the search information storage . The search results provision unit provides as the search results a list of information obtained from the search to the terminal apparatus . Then the reliability presentation unit presents the IP address reliability corresponding to the IP address to the terminal apparatus by referring to .

Furthermore when a search conditional statement is acquired by a search condition acquisition unit the search condition analysis unit may analyze whether the acquired search conditional statement contains a domain name type or an ISP name.

Whether or not a search conditional statement contains a domain name type is determined depending on whether the domain name is classifiable to predetermined domain name types in addition to whether the search conditional statement satisfies the configuration format of the domain name. In this case it is favorable for a group information storage to store a Domain Name Type table as shown in . The Domain Name Type table shown in includes a purpose of the use or the operation and a nation to which the domain name has been assigned corresponding to the domain name type .

Furthermore whether or not a search conditional statement contains an ISP is determined depending on whether the search conditional statement corresponds to any of ISP in charge by referring to the Reliability degree table shown in .

When the search condition analysis unit determines that a search conditional statement contains a domain name type the search unit searches information matching the domain name type of the search conditional statement from a domain name type by referring to searched information files stored in the search information storage . The search results provision unit provides as the search results a list of information obtained from the search to the terminal apparatus . Then a reliability presentation unit presents to the terminal apparatus the domain name reliability corresponding to the domain name type by referring to .

When the search condition analysis unit determines that a search conditional statement contains an ISP the search unit searches information matching the ISP of the search conditional statement from an ISP in charge by referring to searched information files stored in the search information storage . The search results provision unit provides as the search results a list of information obtained from the search to the terminal apparatus . Then the reliability presentation unit presents to the terminal apparatus the ISP reliability corresponding to the ISP in charge by referring to .

According to the present embodiment based on the reliability degree of contents by calculating the reliability degree of an IP address or a domain name corresponding to the contents including the reliability degree of an electronic mail address the reliability degree of the ISP in charge the registry and the domain type per nation etc. may be obtained. Thus by quantifying not only the contents but also the reliability degree of the domain name related to the contents etc. it is expected to have an effect on urging operators of the domain etc. to improve the reliability degree of contents. More specifically examples include restraining ISPs from assigning IP addresses to malicious venders or executing appropriate policies to manage IP addresses by an entire nation.

In the present embodiment based on the reliability degree of the contents to be provided the reliability degree of a domain name an electronic mail address or an IP address is provided but the configuration of any combinations containing at least one reliability degree among a domain name an electronic mail address or an IP address is possible.

The present invention has been explained thus far based on the embodiments. It is understandable for those in the industry that the embodiments are examples various modified examples are possible in combinations of each configuration element and each treatment process thereof and such modified examples are in a scope of the present invention. The modified examples are provided from hereon.

The information search provision apparatus in the embodiments was made to exist as one apparatus however the information search provision apparatus may be realized by cooperation between two servers as the configuration of a modified example. As an example a search controlling unit in may be installed on a search server and function blocks other than that may be placed on a collection server side. Needless to say the configuration in may be divided at a unit other than this to distribute to the search server and to the collection server. The suitable distribution may be determined considering elements such as the convenience of management for the server administrators the load balance of the two servers and the communication volume of both etc.

The information search provision apparatus in Embodiment 8 is comprised of configuration elements belonged to an information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 Embodiment 3 Embodiment 5 Embodiment 6 and Embodiment 7 but as the configuration of other modified example the combination thereof is not limited to this. For example a apparatus including configuration elements of an information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 and configuration elements of an information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 2 may be regarded as a new information search provision apparatus .

In Embodiment 3 depending on whether the contents to be evaluated have been updated the reliability degree of the contents is increased or decreased and as a further different modified example the information search provision apparatus may comprise an analysis unit that analyzes the contents as an analysis result by the analysis unit. When an item that increases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated is contained therein the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated may be increased. Hereafter an example of such an item is described. Furthermore this analysis unit is presumed to internally comprise a source analysis unit that analyzes the source of a timer or a program for acquiring time information.

In the embodiments all the contents stored in a search information storage is the subject to be presented as the search results. As a further different modified example the information search provision apparatus may comprise a presentation limit unit that presents only contents having a high reliability degree to users from the search results. There are web pages with malicious contents on the Internet and by not presenting contents with a low reliability degree to users in the first place accesses to web pages with a low reliability degree may be reduced among all users.

In Embodiment 7 the reliability degree of own contents and other contents related to each other was controlled at the same time depending on consistency or lack thereof of an item to be assessed such as recruitment related information. As a further different modified example among contents acquired by a contents acquisition unit the reliability degree of own contents may be raised as more contents posts items to be assessed. For example suppose the item to be assessed is recruitment information recruiting new graduates the reliability controlling unit increases the reliability degree of the own contents as more contents contains recruiting new graduates. 

As a further different modified example the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 through 8 may further comprise a predicting unit that predicts the reliability degree of contents in future. The predicting unit predicts the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated based on an element contributed to estimating the duration of contents contained in the contents to be evaluated. The element contributed to estimating the duration of contents is for example equivalent to the age of an individual if the contents information provider is an individual equivalent to the growth rate of the company in case of a corporation. To take an example of the former if an individual s age is 30 by 80 years old the life of a normal being or in other words the reliability degree of contents 50 years later is predicted. In the event of prediction the reliability degree of the contents 50 years later may be predicted based on conditions under which the range of increase of the current reliability degree is to be maintained. A reliability presentation unit presents the predicted reliability degree to users. Accordingly if the reliability degree has been further increased the users may use the contents more comfortably not only by knowing the way the reliability degree changed in the past but also by knowing the reliability degree of contents in the future.

In Embodiment 1 the reliability degree was controlled depending on whether it was possible for a collecting unit to collect the contents. As a further different modified example when the contents are not collected by the collecting unit a confirming unit newly installed on an information search provision apparatus may make a confirmation in relation to the absence of contents collection with respect to an item to be confirmed. Hereafter an example of an item to be confirmed is described. Server transfer information or a keyword contained in server failure information is already held in a confirmation item storage not illustrated .

When such server transfer information or server failure information is contained in the contents to be evaluated even if the contents to be evaluated is not collected a reliability controlling unit may control the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated so as not to be decreased. Furthermore then during a period in which the information is being posted in the contents an access determining unit sets an o flag in an Access History column of the contents to be evaluated. Moreover for example when the absence of the collection of the contents to be evaluated continues for ten days the confirming unit may grasp the status of the information provider providing the web server by accessing a database of a third party organization that manages the domain name a key for which is a domain name of the web server on which the contents to be evaluated is posted. Accordingly when there is no reason attributed to the responsibility of the information provider but the information provider is still unable to provide the contents it is possible to save the contents by not decreasing the reliability degree of the contents.

In Embodiment 1 thorough 8 as the search results the information search provision apparatus shows a list of contents and the reliability degree of the contents to the user. As a further different modified example using information such as when a user went to an actual shop or is involved in purchasing or selling by Internet shopping the information search provision apparatus acquires an evaluation value related to the reliability degree of the contents from the user to be reflected on the current reliability degree of the contents. In the present modified example an evaluation value acquisition unit is newly installed on the information search provision apparatus related to Embodiment 1 through 8.

The evaluation value acquisition unit acquires an evaluation value related to the reliability degree of contents from a user. Through the evaluation value acquisition unit an evaluation value represented in a ten step evaluation of 5 through 5 from low to high is acquired the evaluation value is added by a reliability controlling unit to the current reliability degree of the contents. Accordingly it is possible to involve an evaluation with respect to the contents from the user when the contents are used. Thus information search service capable of presenting the reliability degree with further accuracy may be realized.

In Embodiment 2 based on whether related information indicating the presence of a relationship between contents having a high reliability degree and the contents to be evaluated was contained in the contents having a high reliability degree the presence or absence of the relationship was determined in the present modified example based on whether related information indicating the presence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and contents having a high reliability degree is contained in the contents to be evaluated the presence or absence of the relationship is determined. For instance a relationship determining unit determines whether the related information such as a link from the contents to be evaluated to contents having a high reliability degree is contained in the contents to be evaluated. More specifically the relationship determining unit determines whether the URL of the web page posting the contents having a high reliability degree is included in of a tag contained in the contents to be evaluated. Then the URL of the web page posting the contents having a high reliability degree is acquired by the relationship determining unit from searched information files held in a search information storage .

A reliability controlling unit controls in a manner in which the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the presence of the relationship is determined by the relationship determining unit is set higher than the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the absence of the relationship is determined. Accordingly such as it is possible to differentiate a case in which a link to a web page with a high reliability degree is available in the contents to be evaluated from a case in which a link to a web page with a high reliability degree is not available. If URLs matching with multiple sets of contents having a high reliability degree are found in the contents to be evaluated the reliability controlling unit may increase the range of increase of the reliability degree by the number of matching contents. For instance if there are three matches then 3 is further added to the current range of increase of the contents to be evaluated. Accordingly as more links to contents having a high reliability degree become available in the contents to be evaluated the range of increase of the reliability degree may be greater.

In Embodiment 2 and Modified Example 9 the presence or absence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and the contents having a high reliability degree has been determined. As a further different modified example the presence or absence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and contents with a low reliability degree is determined. A method of determining the presence or absence of the relationship by the relationship determining unit in the present modified example is the same as the method of determining the presence or absence of the relationship in Embodiment 2 and Modified Example 9. In other words based on whether related information indicating the presence of a relationship between the contents with a low reliability degree and the contents to be evaluated is contained in the contents with a low reliability degree the relationship determining unit determines the presence or absence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and the contents with a low reliability degree. Furthermore based on whether related information indicating the presence of a relationship between the contents to be evaluated and the contents with a low reliability degree is contained in the contents to be evaluated the relationship determining unit may determine the presence or absence of the relationship between the contents to be evaluated and the contents with a low reliability degree.

In case of the former decision a reliability controlling unit does not reflect the determination of the presence of absence of the relationship made by the relationship determining unit to increase or decrease the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated. Since the contents with a low reliability degree are more likely to possess unreliable information it is significant to ignore the existence of the related information such as links etc. In case of the later decision the reliability controlling unit controls in a manner in which the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the presence of a relationship is determined by the relationship determining unit is set lower than the range of increase of the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated when the absence of the relationship is determined. Accordingly such as it is possible to differentiate a case in which a link to contents with a low reliability degree containing a contents against a public order and moral such as sexual contents or violent contents etc. is present in the contents to be evaluated from a case in which a link to a web page with a low reliability degree is absent.

In Embodiment 6 from a single aspect the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated has been increased or decreased in the present modified example from multiple aspects the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated is increased or decreased. Then an element extracting unit extracts an element contributing to the increase or decrease in the reliability degree of said contents to be evaluated in terms of each aspect in evaluating the reliability degree. More specifically the aspect in evaluating the reliability degree is such as hiring from the contents acquired by a related contents acquisition unit the element extracting unit extracts an element related to hire which contributes to the increase or decrease in the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated.

The aspect in evaluating the reliability degree such as keywords related to hire may be held in an aspect storage preliminary not illustrated . The keywords related to hire may be for example the actual number of people hired or the number of people expected to be hired etc. Then on the contents acquired by the related contents acquisition unit the element extracting unit designates keywords held in the aspect storage and keywords held in said contribution storage and conducts a search to acquire matching information. More specifically when the search is performed with the actual number of people hired and increase as an AND condition the element extracting unit may extract an element contributing to increase in the reliability degree from an aspect of hiring. 

The reliability controlling unit increases or decreases the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated by referring to the element extracted in terms of the each aspect in evaluating the reliability degree. For example if the contents to be evaluated are provided by ABC company and if posted in the acquired contents as the number of people hired by ABC company increased then from an aspect of hire an element increase is extracted by the element extracting unit and the element is classified into said a first group by a classifying unit . Then a reliability controlling unit increases the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated from an aspect in evaluating the reliability degree of hire . Furthermore the reliability controlling unit may set the reliability degree in terms of each aspect to increase or decrease the reliability degree of the each aspect based on the result extracted by the element extracting unit in terms of each aspect in evaluating the reliability degree. Then the reliability controlling unit may sum each reliability degree respectively obtained in terms of each aspect as the reliability degree of the contents to be evaluated. According to the present modified example the reliability degree of contents to be evaluated may be evaluated from various aspects thus increasing the accuracy of the reliability degree.

According to the present invention an information search service that is highly convenient to users may be provided.
