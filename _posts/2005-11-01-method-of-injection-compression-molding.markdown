title: Method of injection compression molding
abstract: In an injection compression molding method, dies are clamped with low pressure and a melted thermoplastic resin composition is filled in a cavity space from a gate while moving the cavity space relative to the gate, and then the dies are clamped with a high pressure substantially simultaneously with completion of the filling to compress and form the thermoplastic resin composition filled in the cavity space. Since the thermoplastic resin composition containing a high content of thermally-conductive filler such as an electrically-conductive filler can be injected and compressed to be molded, the injection compression molding method can be applied in manufacturing molding such as a fuel cell separator and a flat antenna.

The present invention relates to an injection compression molding method of a thermoplastic resin and a molding obtained by the molding method.

Conventionally various methods have been used as manufacturing methods of a molding where an injection molding method an extrusion molding method etc. are known. Recently as a molding molded by such molding methods a molding containing a thermoplastic resin with a high content of filler mixed therein has been introduced. For instance there is known a fuel cell separator containing a thermoplastic resin with a filler such as graphite carbon and carbon fiber mixed therein.

The fuel cell separator is disposed so as to sandwich a solid electrolyte and an air electrode and a fuel electrode arranged on both sides of the solid electrolyte in a fuel cell. The air oxygen and a fuel gas hydrogen are respectively fed to the air electrode and the fuel electrode through grooves formed on the fuel cell separator.

When a molding is formed of a material containing a high content of filler as the fuel cell separator fluidity of the material is degraded so that a filling pressure of the material needs to be increased to perform molding.

Then there has been proposed a molding method such as an injection compression molding method and a rapid heating cooling method for molding using such materials with low fluidity see for instance Patent Document 1 .

However in the injection compression molding method disclosed in Reference 1 which uses a molding machine with a gate for injecting a melted resin being fixed it has been difficult to secure uniformity of thickness of a product when a resin composition containing a high content of carbon filler and having extremely low fluidity is molded. Also in the rapid heating cooling method in which a die is heated to a high temperature to smoothly fill a resin it has taken time to raise a die temperature undesirably causing degradation of productivity with a long molding cycle.

Especially several hundreds of the fuel cell separators are used in the fuel cell and uniformity of dimensional accuracy is important in an example of a required performance variation of thickness difference between maximum value and minimum value is desired to be 60 m or less .

There has also been proposed another method in which a cavity of a die or a gate is slid to shorten an apparent moving distance of a melted resin composition in the cavity in order to obtain a thin molding with a uniformed property. For instance a material molding method has been proposed where a traveling piece having a material injection port is provided on either a fixed retainer plate or a movable retainer plate so that the material injection port is displaced relative to a cavity surface in a filling process of a molding material see for instance Patent Document 2 .

Further there has been another resin molding method in which when a melted resin is injected into a cavity from a gate through a resin injection port and a running section the melted resin is injected while relatively moving the gate and the cavity see for instance Patent Document 3 .

However in the molding methods described above when a resin material containing a high content of electrically conductive filler and thus having extremely low fluidity it is difficult to transcribe fine grooves as required in a fuel cell polymer separator only by shortening the apparent moving distance of the resin and further a conductive performance and a mechanical strength of the grooves cannot be satisfied. On the other hand in order to enhance a transcription performance the content of the filler requires to be reduced which causes degradation of the conductive performance so that improvement of the molding method has been demanded.

Although an example of a fuel cell polymer separator is described above a flat antenna that has been recently diffused is also molded with a similar material which has faced a similar problem.

An object of the present invention is to provide an injection compression molding method that can easily obtain a molding having almost no density gradient with components dispersed uniformly uniformed thickness and excellent dimensional accuracy even when a thermoplastic resin composition having very low fluidity in a melted state is used and a molding obtained by the method.

Another object of the present invention is to provide an injection compression molding method capable of shortening a molding cycle even when a material with extremely low fluidity in a melted state is used as well as enhancing productivity of a molding and a molding obtained by the method.

An injection compression molding method according to an aspect of the present invention for obtaining a molding by injecting and filling a melted material containing a thermoplastic resin in a cavity space formed in dies through a gate and by compressing and forming the material in the cavity space includes an injection filling step for clamping the dies with a low pressure and injecting and filling the melted material in the cavity space from the gate while moving the cavity space relative to the gate and a compression forming step for clamping the dies with a high pressure substantially simultaneously with completion of the filling to compress and form the material filled in the cavity space.

Here the dies are clamped with the low pressure in the injection filling step in a case where a size of the molding is for instance A4 size approx. 200 mm 300 mm a clamping force may be around 10 to 100 tons while when the dies are clamped with the high pressure in the compression forming step the clamping force may be around 200 to 350 tons.

Incidentally the injection compression molding method according to the aspect of the present invention includes in addition to a molding method of the thermoplastic resin itself an injection compression molding method of a thermoplastic resin composition containing a thermoplastic resin and a thermally conductive filler such as an electrically conductive filler and a metal filler.

According to the injection compression molding method of the present invention the dies are clamped with the low pressure and the melted material is injected and filled while moving the cavity space relative to the gate and then the dies are clamped with the high pressure substantially simultaneously with the completion of the filling to compress and form the material having been filled in the cavity space. Thus even when a thermoplastic resin composition containing the high content of thermally conductive filler such as the electrically conductive filler and the metal filler and having low fluidity in the melted state is molded as the material an unfilled part in the cavity space is continuously formed just below the injection port of the gate which shortens an apparent flowing length of the material allowing the molding having uniformed density with almost no density gradient to be obtained. Also the molding having great dimensional accuracy with small thickness distribution can be obtained and further even when a complex shape such as fine grooves is formed on the molding the fine grooves can be prevented from being broken or chipped.

According to the injection compression molding method of the present invention since the melted material is filled while moving the cavity space to cause the apparent flowing length of the melted material to be shortened the melted material can be filled with low filling pressure and at a die temperature around crystallization temperature of the thermoplastic resin in a short time e.g. 1 to 2 seconds so that good moldability can be achieved. Further since rapid heating cooling of the die is not required the molding cycle can be greatly shortened thus lowering production cost.

In the injection compression molding method according to the present invention it is preferable that a direction in which the material is injected and filled forms an acute angle with a moving direction of the cavity space and the acute angle is in the range of 25 to 75 .

According to the aspect of the present invention since the direction in which the material is injected and filled forms an acute angle with the moving direction of the cavity space specifically 25 to 75 the filling pressure of the material being filled in the cavity space can be lowered and generation of fine weld marks can be prevented. Thus even in a case where for instance a molding such as a fuel separator that requires formation of fine grooves is molded the fine grooves can be prevented from being broken or chipped thus enhancing strength.

In the injection compression molding method according to the present invention it is preferable that the compression forming is performed by moving a compression block disposed in the dies toward the cavity space.

According to the aspect of the present invention since the compression forming of the material filled in the cavity space is performed by moving forward the compression block disposed in the die toward the cavity space the compression forming of the material filled in the cavity space can be performed easily and securely.

In the injection compression molding method according to the present invention it is preferable that a manufacturing machine including dies having a pair of molding dies disposed opposite to each other with the cavity space formed therein a heating device for heating at least one of the molding dies which has a dent as the cavity space a filling device for filling the melted material in the cavity space a compressing device for compressing and forming the material filled in the cavity space a cooling device for cooling the material in the cavity space and a carrying device for carrying the dies or one of the molding dies to the respective devices is used the heating device the filling device the compressing device and the cooling device being arranged substantially on a single circle. Further it is preferable to perform a heating step with the heating device for heating the dies or one of the molding dies a filling step with the filling device for filling the melted material in the cavity space while moving the cavity space relative to the gate a compression forming step with the compressing device for compressing and forming the material in the cavity space and a cooling step with the cooling device for cooling the material in the cavity space.

Here according to the aspect of the present invention the carrying device may carry one of the molding dies or the entire dies including the pair of molding dies.

According to the present invention since the material is filled while moving the cavity space in the filling step the material can be spread uniformly in the cavity space even when the material has low fluidity. With the arrangement the uniformity of the thickness of the molding can be secured.

Further since the material is filled while moving the cavity space in the filling step the apparent flowing length of the material is shortened so that high filling pressure becomes unnecessary in filling the material.

Thus in a case where the molding is for instance a fuel cell separator formation of a skin that causes increase of electrical resistance can be prevented.

Further since the material is filled while moving the cavity space in the filling step the uniformity of the thickness of the molding can be secured so that unlike conventional methods the rapid heating cooling of the die is not required thus greatly shortening the molding cycle.

Still further since the material is filled while moving the cavity in the filling step generation of the weld marks can be prevented thus enhancing the strength of the molding.

For instance when a through hole opening or the like which intersects with a direction in which the material of the molding is introduced is formed on the molding since the material flows around the through hole the flow of the material collides in the vicinity of the through hole which might cause generation of the weld marks. On the other hand by filling the material while moving the cavity space as in the present invention the flow of the material can be prevented from colliding in the vicinity of the through hole thus preventing generation of the weld marks.

According to the molding method of the present invention the molding is manufactured using the manufacturing machine including the heating device the filling device the compressing device the cooling device and the carrying device for carrying the dies or the molding dies to the respective devices the heating device the filling device the compressing device and the cooling device being arranged substantially on a single circle.

In the manufacturing machine described above since the dies or the molding die can be carried to the filling device by the carrying device after heating the dies or the molding dies by the heating device the next dies or the next molding die can be heated while the current one is filled by the filling device. With the arrangement the molding can be manufactured continuously so that productivity of the molding can be enhanced.

Since the manufacturing machine used in the present invention includes the heating device the filling device the compressing device and the cooling device arranged substantially on the single circle it saves spaces as compared to a machine having the respective devices arranged linearly.

In the injection compression molding method according to the present invention it is preferable that a temperature of the dies or one of the molding dies is set to equal to or higher than a melting point of the thermoplastic resin in the filling step and the temperature of the dies or one of the molding dies is so adjusted that the temperature reaches a temperature equal to or lower than a crystallization temperature of the thermoplastic resin after starting the compression forming in the compression forming step.

According to the present invention since the temperature of the dies or one of the molding dies is set to be equal to or higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin in the filling step the fluidity of the thermoplastic resin contained in the material to be filled in the cavity space can be enhanced in the filling step. With the arrangement the material can be spread more uniformly in the cavity space.

By controlling the temperature of the dies or one of molding dies so as to reach the temperature equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature of the thermoplastic resin after starting the compression forming in a case where transcription is performed on the material in the cavity space in the compression forming step the transcription performance can be enhanced.

A molding according to another aspect of the present invention is obtained by molding a material containing a thermoplastic resin and a thermally conductive filler using the above described injection compression molding method of the present invention.

According to the molding of the present invention the thermoplastic resin composition containing the thermally conductive filler such as the electrically conductive filler and the metal filler is molded using the above described injection compression molding method of the present invention advantages described above can be attained.

In other words the molding has almost no density gradient with the thermally conductive filler dispersed uniformly while having great dimensional accuracy with small thickness distribution and further even when a complex shape such as the one having fine grooves is formed on the molding the fine grooves can be prevented from being broken or chipped.

In the molding according to the present invention it is preferable that the material contains 60 wt or more of the thermally conductive filler of the total material.

According to the present invention since the molding is formed of the thermoplastic resin composition containing 60 wt or more of the thermally conductive filler such as the electrically conductive filler and the metal filler the molding can attain the advantages described above and can be provided with high electrical conductivity.

Since the molding of the present invention has advantages described above the molding can exert the advantages to the maximum extent when being applied to the fuel cell separator or the flat antenna.

In the molding according to the present invention it is preferable that a plurality of grooves are integrally formed on a surface of the molding. In the molding according to the present invention it is preferable that a width L of a bottom part of a protruded tread sandwiched between the grooves is 0 to 10 mm a width L of a top of the protruded tread is 0 to 10 mm required to be L L a height H of the protruded tread is 0.2 mm or more a width W of each of the grooves is 5 mm or less and a pitch P of the grooves is 15 mm or less.

At this time a vertical cross section of the protruded tread can have any shape such as quadrate rectangle trapezoid semi sphere triangle and semi sphere with a part thereof being cut.

Embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the attached drawings.

Examples of the thermoplastic resin that can be used in the injection compression molding method of the present invention are not particularly limited and known thermoplastic resins can be appropriately used depending on applications and the like of a molding to be molded.

When a fuel cell separator is molded it is preferable to use a resin material having heat resistance water resistance and chemical resistance examples of which include a polyphenylene sulfide PPS resin an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS resin a polycarbonate PC resin a polyphenylene oxide PPO resin a polyacetal resin a syndiotactic polystyrene SPS resin etc and one of those materials can be used singularly or two or more of those materials can be used in combination. In implementing the method of the present invention the polyphenylene sulfide PPS resin is preferable for manufacturing the fuel cell separator while the syndiotactic polystyrene SPS resin is preferable for manufacturing a flat antenna.

Further when for instance the polyphenylene sulfide PPS resin is used as the thermoplastic resin a polyolefin wax may be added the polyolefin wax enhancing fluidity of the PPS resin and enhancing dispersibility of a later described thermally conductive filler. Also addition of the polyolefin wax provides a thermoplastic resin composition with a preferable heat resistance.

The polyolefin wax is an artificial wax manufactured through polymerization which includes a polyethylene wax a polypropylene wax an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer wax and the like. In addition the polyolefin waxes such as a polyethylene oxide wax a polypropylene oxide wax an MAH polypropylene copolymer wax and an oxide ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer wax can also be used.

A thermoplastic resin composition obtained by adding a thermally conductive filler having various performances to the above described thermoplastic resins can be employed. As the thermally conductive filler for instance ones having thermal conductivity of 1.0 to 500 W m C. at 20 C.

The performances of the thermally conductive fillers include electrical conductivity high dielectric constant and the like. Fillers having electrical conductivity electrically conductive filler can be applied in for instance molding the fuel cell separator.

Specifically various graphites such as a natural graphite an artificial graphite and an exfoliated graphite a carbon black a carbon fiber a vapor grown carbon fiber a carbon nanotube and the like can be exemplified one of which may be used singularly or two or more of which may be used in combination. In implementing the method of the present invention it is preferable to use a graphite having small electrical resistibility with great electrical conductivity and having good dispersibility.

Incidentally shapes of the electrically conductive fillers are preferably spherical or powdery with for instance average particle size of 10 to 200 m and bulk specific gravity of 0.15 to 0.90 g cm.

In molding the flat antenna for instance fillers having a high dielectric constant high dielectric constant filler highly dielectric filler such as a calcium titanate a magnesium titanate a barium titanate a strontium titanate a neodymium titanate and a titanium oxide can be used. Shapes of the high dielectric constant fillers are preferably spherical and powdery with for instance average particle size of 0.1 to 10 m.

In molding a radiator plate for instance metal powders such as gold powder iron powder copper powder and nickel powder can be used as the thermally conductive filler. The average particle size of the metal powders may be around 0.1 to 10 m 1 to 20 m should be more preferable in use.

A thermoplastic resin composition can be obtained by mixing a thermally conductive filler represented by the electrically conductive filler the high dielectric constant filler etc. and the above described thermoplastic resin. In obtaining the thermoplastic resin composition 60 wt or more preferably 75 to 95 wt of the thermally conductive filler is preferably contained in the total composition.

In the molding method of the present invention even when the thermoplastic resin composition containing high contents of the thermally conductive filler is used the thermally conductive filler can be dispersed uniformly to obtain the molding having almost no density gradient and having great dimensional accuracy with small thickness distribution and further even when a complex shape such as fine grooves is formed on the molding the fine grooves can be prevented from being broken or chipped. In addition since content of the thermally conductive filler in the obtained molding is also high as described above the molding has high thermal conductivity while in case with electrically conductive filler the obtained molding has high electrical conductivity.

In order to obtain the thermoplastic resin composition by mixing or kneading the thermoplastic resin and the thermally conductive filler it is preferable to mix the both uniformly using known mixers or kneading machines such as a roller an extruder a kneader Banbury mixer Henschel mixer and a planetary mixer.

Note that an additional filler can be added to the thermoplastic resin composition containing the thermally conductive filler and the thermoplastic resin to the extent that does not affect the advantages of the present invention.

Examples of the additional filler include fiber fillers such as a glass fiber a potassium titanate whisker a zinc oxide whisker an aluminum borate whisker an aramid fiber an alumina fiber a silicon carbide fiber a ceramic fiber an asbestos fiber a gypsum fiber and a metal fiber silicates such as a wollastonite a zeolite a sericite a kaoline a mica a clay a pyrophyllite a bentonite an asbestos a talc and an aluminosilicate metal compounds such as an alumina a silicon oxide a magnesium oxide a zirconium oxide a titanium oxide and an iron oxide carbonates such as a calcium carbonate a magnesium carbonate and a dolomite sulfates such as a calcium sulfate and a barium sulfate hydroxides such as a magnesium hydroxide a calcium hydroxide and an aluminum hydroxide and non fiber fillers such as a glass bead a glass flake a ceramic bead a boron nitride a silicon carbide and a silica which may be a hollow body. Also one of the fillers may be used singularly or two or more fillers may be used in combination. In order to obtain high mechanical strength the fiber fillers or the non fiber fillers may be pretreated by coupling agents such as isocyanate compound organic silane compound organic titanate compound organic borate compound and epoxy compound in use.

Also for the thermoplastic resin composition containing the thermoplastic resin and thermally conductive filler crystal nucleus agents such as an organic phosphorous compound a polyetheretherketone anti coloring agents such as a hypophosphorous acid antioxidants such as a hindered phenol a hindered amine an ultraviolet ray protective agent coloring agents such as dye and pigment heat stabilizer lubricant antistatic agent and plasticizer can be added to the extent that does not affect the advantages of the present invention.

When the molding method of the present invention using the injection compression molding unit shown in is implemented dies are first clamped with facing surfaces thereof facing each other and then a melted thermoplastic resin is injected from a gate connected to an injection unit to be filled in a cavity space defined by a compression block provided in the die and two cavity blocks injection filling step .

Incidentally a molding material to be used will be described as a thermoplastic resin composition containing a thermoplastic resin and an electrically conductive filler in the following description.

In the molding method of the present invention the dies in the injection filling step are clamped with a lower pressure around 10 to 100 tons. By clamping the dies with the lower pressure during injection filling of the resin the cavity space can be moved smoothly so that deformation of the dies can be reduced and outgassing can be expected.

In the injection filling of the resin in the molding method of the present invention by moving the cavity space the resin can be filled in a wide area at high speed even with low filling pressure the dies will not be opened even with a low clamping force.

A space of the cavity space may be determined depending on type shape size etc. of the molding to be molded which may be 2 to 4 mm.

Die temperature may be determined depending on the type or the like of the molding and type of the thermoplastic resin composition which may be 150 to 230 C. By setting the molding temperature to the above described range the molding can be cooled smoothly and thus the injection compression molding can be performed easily.

In the molding method of the present invention after clamping the dies with a low pressure the melted thermoplastic resin composition is injected and filled in the cavity space defined by the compression block and the cavity blocks from the gate connected to the injection unit while moving the cavity space from the left side to the right side in the drawing .

Here if dies having a fixed gate is used as normal injection molding density gradient is generated between the resin near the gate and the resin at a tip of the flowing resin which is particularly remarkable with a resin composition having low fluidity. On the other hand in the molding method of the present invention where the melted thermoplastic resin composition is filled and injected while moving the cavity space an unfilled part of the cavity space is continuously formed directly below an injection port of the gate thus shortening an apparent flowing length of the resin composition . Thus even when the thermoplastic resin composition contains the high content of electrically conductive filler and has extremely low fluidity in melted condition the molding with almost no density gradient can be obtained.

The gate used for filling the thermoplastic resin composition may be a layered gate film gate etc. that corresponds to the width of the cavity space . As another type of the gate for instance a known film gate of hot runner molding having a gate shut open valve may be used.

In the embodiment shown in the gate may be formed so as to form an acute angle with a moving direction rightward in of the cavity space so that a direction in which the thermoplastic resin composition is injected and filled forms an acute angle with the moving direction of the cavity space . With the arrangement the filling pressure of the resin can be lowered and generation of fine weld marks on a surface of the molding can be prevented so that when a fuel cell separator having a lot of fine grooves is molded as the molding the fine grooves can be prevented from being chipped.

Here arrangements of the gate are shown respectively by a gate shown by a chain line in being arranged to form the right angle with the moving direction of the cavity space a gate shown by a solid line in being arranged to form an acute angle with the direction of the cavity space and a gate shown by a chain double dashed line in being arranged to form an obtuse angle with the moving direction of the cavity space . An angle is an angle formed by the gate and the moving direction of the cavity space .

Note that when the thermoplastic resin or the thermoplastic resin composition with the heat capacity not being extremely low is injected and filled although the resin or the resin composition is also injected in the direction opposite to the moving direction of the cavity space that can be re heated and melted by heat from the melted resin being continuously introduced so that the problem of the weld marks can be solved and a proper molding can be obtained.

Accordingly as shown in the melted resin composition being injected sequentially overrides the melted resin composition that has been preciously injected so that the resulted molding does not have fine weld marks on the surface. Thus when the fuel cell separator or the like having the fine grooves is molded the fine grooves can be prevented from being broken or chipped thus enhancing the strength of the molding.

Although not shown when the melted thermoplastic resin composition is injected and filled by the gate arranged to form the obtuse angle with the moving direction of the cavity space the filling pressure of the resin increases to cause the resin composition in to generate significantly which results in frequent generation of the weld marks and further degradation of the strength and the appearance of the molding.

The angle formed by the gate and the moving direction of the cavity space as shown in defines an angle formed by the direction in which the thermoplastic resin composition is injected and filled and the moving direction of the cavity space the angle being preferably in the range of 25 to 75 more preferably 40 to 60 . If the angle is smaller than 25 the thickness of the gate becomes too thin to provide sufficient strength to the dies while if the angle exceeds 75 the advantages described above cannot be attained.

Then when the injection filling of a predetermined quantity of the thermoplastic resin composition in the injection filling step is completed at the same time with the completion of the filling the pressure with which the dies are clamped is raised from the low pressure to a high pressure e.g. 200 to 350 tons as shown in while moving the compression block forward upward in so that the filled thermoplastic resin composition is compressed and formed to obtain the molding of a predetermined shape compression forming step .

As described above if the resin composition is filled only by moving the cavity space the fluidity of the melted thermoplastic resin composition is too low to introduce the thermoplastic resin composition into the fine grooves formed on the dies which might cause the grooves to be chipped. However with the above arrangement by clamping the dies with the high pressure just after filling the thermoplastic resin composition to perform compression and forming the melted thermoplastic resin composition can reach every protruded and dented part of the grooves resulting in obtaining the molding with excellent transcription performance of the fine grooves.

Incidentally although the compression forming step is started simultaneously with the completion of the filling of the thermoplastic resin composition which may be started after the filling is thoroughly completed or just before e.g. 0.1 to 0.5 seconds before the filling is completed.

In performing the molding method of the present invention a compression speed in the compression forming step is preferably around 2 to 5 mm sec. By setting the compression speed in such range the injected and filled thermoplastic resin composition can be preferably compressed and formed.

As for the compression pressure in the compression forming step when an area of the cavity is 200 mm 300 mm an average resin pressure is preferably 15 MPa or higher more preferably 30 to 60 MPa. A clamping pressure in such case is preferably around 200 tons more preferably 350 tons. When the compression pressure average resin pressure is 15 MPa or higher the compression forming can be performed sufficiently properly and a shrink or a warp is not generated on the appearance of the molding thus obtaining the molding with proper appearance.

After moving the injection compression molding unit forward as described above and closing and clamping the dies with the high pressure to compress and form the filled thermoplastic resin composition the dies are cooled to solidify the thermoplastic resin composition in the dies . Although a cooling condition is not particularly limited a cooling temperature may be 150 to 230 C. while a cooling time may be 20 to 80 seconds.

Then once the thermoplastic resin composition is cooled and solidified the dies are opened to remove and obtain the molding.

Incidentally the dies shown in have springs provided between the compression block and the cavity blocks .

Referring to an example of a procedures for performing the injection compression molding method of the present invention.

After the dies are clamped with the low pressure of around 10 to 100 tons per cavity area of approx. 200 300 mm same condition in the following description the melted thermoplastic resin composition sent out from the injection unit is injected from the gate into the cavity space . Simultaneously by driving the slide cylinder to move the compression block and the two cavity blocks the melted thermoplastic resin composition sent out from the gate is filled while moving the cavity space injection filling step .

The injection filling of the thermoplastic resin composition in the injection filling step is started with a tip of the gate facing the lowermost part of the cavity space as shown in then the gate is moved as shown in and when the tip of the gate faces the uppermost part of the cavity space and the thermoplastic resin composition is completely injected and filled in the cavity space the injection filling is completed.

As described above when the melted thermoplastic resin composition is injected and filled in the cavity space and the filling is completed as shown in the dies is clamped with the high pressure of around 200 to 350 tons substantially simultaneously with the completion of the filling while driving and moving the compression cylinder toward the cavity space to move the compression block forward thereby compressing and forming the thermoplastic resin composition filled in the cavity space compression forming step .

Then once the thermoplastic resin composition in the cavity space is compressed and formed the dies are cooled to solidify the thermoplastic resin composition in the dies . Once the thermoplastic resin composition is cooled and solidified the dies are opened to remove and obtain the molding.

According to the injection compression molding method of the thermoplastic resin of the present invention performed as described above the melted thermoplastic resin composition is injected and filled while clamping the dies with the low pressure and moving the cavity space relative to the gate and then the dies are clamped with the high pressure to compress and form the thermoplastic resin composition filled in the cavity space substantially simultaneously with the completion of the filling. With the arrangement even when the thermoplastic resin composition having low fluidity in the melted state is used the unfilled part of the cavity space is continuously formed directly below the injection port of the gate thus shortening the apparent flowing length of the resin composition. Thus the molding having uniformed density with almost no density gradient and great dimensional accuracy with small thickness distribution can be obtained and further even when a complex shape such as fine grooves is formed on the molding the fine grooves can be prevented from being broken or chipped.

In addition in the injection compression molding method of the thermoplastic resin according to the present invention since the melted thermoplastic resin composition is filled while moving the cavity space the die temperature can be set to lower as compared in the normal injection molding and the injection compression molding that do not include movement of the cavity so that the molding cycle can be drastically shortened thus lowering the production cost. The molding method of the present invention is also superior in moldability thus lowering the production cost.

As described above even when the thermoplastic resin composition containing high contents of the thermally conductive filler and having low fluidity in the melted state is used the molding obtained by the injection compression molding method of the present invention has almost no density gradient with the thermally conductive filler dispersed uniformly as well as having great dimensional accuracy with small thickness distribution and further even when the complex shape such as the one having fine grooves is formed on the molding the fine grooves can be prevented from being broken or chipped.

Since the molding can be molded into a desired shape the molding can be widely applied in molding the fuel cell separator especially a polymer electrolyte fuel cell separator using the electrically conductive filler as the thermally conductive filler in molding the flat antenna using the highly dielectric filler as the thermally conductive filler in molding the radiator plate using the metal filler as the thermally conductive filler and the like.

Specifically the fuel cell separator containing high contents of the black graphite with high electrical conductivity the radiator plate containing the high content of metal powder with high thermal conductivity to have high thermal conductivity and the flat antenna containing the high content of highly dielectric filler with high frequency property can be exemplified. Although the thermoplastic resin composition containing the high content of those fillers show significantly low fluidity due to heat release in the injection filling step the molding method of the present invention allows these fillers to be dispersed uniformly the moldings with high product performance can be provided.

The fuel cell shown in includes a fuel electrode an electrolyte plate an oxidized pole plate and a fuel cell separator hereinafter simply referred to as separator in some cases and a plurality of grooves are formed respectively on both front and back sides of the separator .

The plurality of grooves formed on the fuel cell separator grooves with 2 mm in width 0.5 mm in depth and 200 mm in length are preferably formed at one time by transcribing using the injection compression molding method of the present invention so that machining such as cutting is not necessary enabling the separator to be obtained with low cost.

Note that the separator might not be formed in a predetermined shape only by a single injection compression molding using the dies depending on the shape so that machining such as cutting drilling and threading can be provided to the obtained molding as additional processes.

Incidentally the above description shows an example of the present invention and the present invention is not limited to the above described embodiments but includes modifications and variations as long as the objects and the advantages of the present invention can be achieved. Further specific structure and shape of the components in implementing the present invention may be designed in any manner as long as the objects of the present invention can be achieved

For instance in the above described embodiments the dies shown in include the compression cylinder and by moving the compression block using the compression cylinder toward the cavity space the thermoplastic resin composition filled in the cavity space is compressed and formed. However in dies shown in the die may be moved toward the cavity space to compress and form the thermoplastic resin composition filled in the cavity space .

Incidentally in the following description the same reference numeral will be attached to the same components as the above to omit the description thereof.

Incidentally the dies shown in have springs provided between the dies in addition to the springs provided between the compression block and the cavity blocks .

The dies shown in are clamped with the low pressure of around 10 to 100 tons as with the dies shown in the melted thermoplastic resin composition sent out by the injection unit is injected and filled into the cavity space from the gate while actuating the slide cylinder to move the cavity space defined by the compression block and the two cavity blocks relative to the gate .

Next by clamping the dies with the high pressure of around 200 to 350 tons and moving the dies toward the cavity space with substantially simultaneously with the completion of the filling of the thermoplastic resin composition the thermoplastic resin composition filled in the cavity space is compressed and formed compression forming step .

The following operations are the same as with the dies shown in once the thermoplastic resin composition is compressed and formed the dies are cooled to solidify the thermoplastic resin composition in the dies and once the thermoplastic resin composition is cooled and solidified the dies are opened to remove and obtain the molding.

In a manufacturing machine of the present embodiment performs injection compression molding of the thermoplastic resin composition refer to as a material containing the thermoplastic resin and the thermally conductive filler having electrical conductivity in accordance with the present invention to manufacture the fuel cell separator as the molding refer to .

In the extruding device the thermoplastic resin composition introduced from the hopper C is heated by the heater of the cylinder A moved by the screw B rotated by the oil pressure power unit toward the nozzle D at a tip of the cylinder A while being plasticized and extruded via the nozzle D into a cavity space in the molding die .

The table supports the molding die when the thermoplastic resin composition is filled in the molding die .

The molding die is disposed opposite to the cavity space of the molding die the molding die having a gate A formed therein. The gate A is connected to the above described nozzle D through which the thermoplastic resin composition is filled in the cavity space of the molding die . The molding dies and constitute a pair of the dies.

The table and the molding die are heated by the heater block and the molding die is heated to the temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic rein contained in the thermoplastic resin composition .

The moving device moves the molding die mounted on the table relative to the gate A In other words the cavity space of the molding die is moved by the moving device relative to the gate A.

The moving device is for instance an oil pressure cylinder which includes a cylindrical cylinder body A and an axial piston B that slides in the cylinder body A.

As shown in C and D the compressing device compresses and forms the thermoplastic resin composition filled in the molding die by the filling device .

The compressing device includes a movable molding die and a table which mounts the molding die on the table while compression and forming the thermoplastic resin composition in the molding die with the molding die disposed opposite to the molding die . The molding dies and constitute a pair of the dies.

A dent A is formed on a surface A of the molding die body A on the table side and the compression nested block B is inserted into the dent A.

The compression nested block B has a rectangular shape in plan view corresponding to the dent of the molding die on which a plurality of grooves are formed on a surface on the table side. Shapes of the grooves are arbitrary so that linear grooves may be arranged in parallel to each other or in orthogonal to each other.

When the compression nested block B is inserted into the dent A of the molding die body A the surface having the grooves of the compression nested block B projects from the surface A of the molding die body A toward the table . In other words the thickness of the compression nested block B is larger than the depth of the dent A of the molding die body A.

The plurality of grooves on the compression nested block B are transcribed on the thermoplastic resin composition when the thermoplastic resin composition filled in the molding die is compressed and formed.

The compressing device includes a heater not shown which adjust the temperature of the molding die to be equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature of the thermoplastic resin contained in the thermoplastic resin composition after compression forming is started. For instance the molding die is adjusted to be 230 C. after the compression forming is started.

As shown in E and F the cooling device cools and solidifies the thermoplastic resin composition compressed and formed by the compressing device to remove the thermoplastic resin composition as the separator . The molding die is cooled to the temperature equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature of the thermoplastic resin contained in the thermoplastic resin composition e.g. 180 C.

The cooling device includes a movable molding die and a table in which the molding die and the table sandwich and cool the molding die . The molding die includes a molding die body A and the above described compression nested block B. A dent A is formed on a surface A of the molding die body A on the table side to which the above described compression nested block B is inserted.

When the compression nested block B is inserted into the dent A the surface having the grooves of the compression nested block B projects from the surface A of the molding die body A toward the table . In other words the thickness of the compression nested block B is larger than the depth of the dent A of the molding die body A.

The dent A of the molding die body A has a substantially rectangular shape in plan view the planar shape of which is larger than that of the compression nested block B. For instance the width T of the dent A in is larger than the width H of the compression nested block B.

When the separator is removed after cooling the thermoplastic resin composition in the molding die with the cooling device the molding die body A and the compression nested block B are integrally moved away from the molding die as shown in .

The carrying device carries the molding die to the heating device the filling device the compressing device and the cooling device . An arrangement of the carrying device is arbitrary as long as it carries the molding die to the heating device the filling device the compressing device and the cooling device which for instance may include a movable table on which the molding die is mounted and rails to move the movable table or may sandwich lateral sides of the molding die in carrying the molding die .

The carrying device moves in directions shown by arrows Y in to carry the molding die to the heating device the filling device the compressing device and the cooling device .

When the molding die is heated to a predetermined temperature e.g. 300 C. the molding die is carried to the mount table A of the transferring device of the filling device by the carrying device . The molding die is then mounted on the table by the carrying section of the transferring device . Then as shown in the melted thermoplastic resin composition is filled in the cavity space of the molding die by the extruding device filling step .

At this time the temperature of the molding die is equal to or higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin composition as the material e.g. 300 C. .

When the thermoplastic resin composition is filled in the cavity space of the molding die the moving device is actuated to slide the piston B in the cylinder body A so that the cavity space of the molding die is moved relative to the gate A.

Next the molding die filled with the thermoplastic resin composition is carried by the carrying section of the transferring device and again mounted on the mount table A of the transferring device .

As shown in in the compressing device the molding die is set on the table and the molding die is moved down with the molding die body A and the compression nested block B being integrated to compress and form the thermoplastic resin composition in the cavity space of the molding die compression forming step . Then after starting compression forming the temperature of the molding die is adjusted to be equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature of the thermoplastic resin contained in the thermoplastic resin composition . For instance the molding die is adjusted to be 230 C.

Here by starting the compression forming before the temperature of the molding die becomes equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature of the thermoplastic resin contained in the thermoplastic resin composition the compression nested block B can be pressed to the thermoplastic resin composition in the melted state so that the melted thermoplastic resin composition can be introduced into the grooves on the compression nested block B. In the compressing device as described above the temperature of the molding die can be kept equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature with the thermoplastic resin composition introduced in the grooves on the compression nested block B.

Incidentally when heating of the another molding die by the heating device is completed while the compression forming step is performed by the compressing device the another molding die is carried to the filling device by the carrying device to perform the filling step.

After completing the compression forming step the molding device body A of the molding device is moved upward and away from the molding die . At this time as shown in the molding die body A and the compression nested block B are separated the compression nested block B staying on the thermoplastic resin composition in the molding die .

Next the molding die and the compression nested block B on the molding die are carried to the cooling device by the carrying device . In the cooling device the molding die and the compression nested block B are set on the table . Then the molding die body A is moved down to the table and the compression nested block B is inserted into the dent A of the molding die body A as shown in . Thereby the molding die is cooled so that the thermoplastic resin composition in the molding die is solidified cooling step . Consequently manufacturing of the separator is completed.

When the separator is removed as shown in the molding die body A and the compression nested block B are integrally moved upward and away from the molding die . The separator can thus be removed from the molding die .

Incidentally the molding die from which the separator is removed is again carried to the heating device to be heated.

 1 In the filling step since the thermoplastic resin composition is filled in the cavity space while moving the cavity space relative to the gate A even when the thermoplastic resin composition with low fluidity is used the thermoplastic resin composition can be spread in the cavity space uniformly. For instance if the thermoplastic resin composition that contains the high content of thermally conductive filler having an electrical conductivity and has low fluidity is used as the one used in the separator the thermoplastic resin composition can be spread in the cavity space uniformly. With the arrangement the uniformity of the thickness of the separator can be secured.

 2 Since the thermoplastic resin composition is filled while moving the cavity space relative to the gate A in the filling step the apparent flowing length of the thermoplastic resin composition is shortened so that high filling pressure becomes unnecessary in filling the thermoplastic resin composition . Thus in a case where for instance the fuel cell separator is molded formation of a skin causing increase of electrical resistance can be prevented.

 3 Further since the thermoplastic resin composition is filled while moving the cavity space in the filling step the uniformity of the thickness of the separator can be secured so that unlike the related arts the rapid heating cooling of the dies is not required thus greatly shortening the molding cycle.

Still further since the thermoplastic resin composition is filled while moving the cavity space in the filling step generation of the weld marks can be prevented thus enhancing the strength of the separator .

 4 According to the present embodiment the molding is manufactured using the manufacturing machine including the heating device the filling device the compressing device the cooling device and the carrying device for carrying the molding die to each of the above described devices and the heating device the filling device the compressing device and the cooling device being arranged substantially on a single circle.

Since the molding die can be carried to the filling device by the carrying device after heating the molding die with the heating device another molding die can be heated while the current one is filled by the filling device . With the arrangement the separator can be manufactured continuously so that productivity of the separator can be enhanced.

 5 Since the manufacturing machine used in the present embodiment includes the heating device the filling device the compressing device and the cooling device arranged substantially on the single circle it saves spaces as compared to the one including the respective devices to arranged linearly.

 6 Since the temperature of the molding die is set to be equal to or higher than the melting point of the thermoplastic resin in the filling step the fluidity of the thermoplastic resin contained in the thermoplastic resin composition to be filled in the cavity space in the filling step can be enhanced. With the arrangement the thermoplastic resin composition can be spread more uniformly in the cavity space.

Further by starting the compression forming before the temperature of the molding die becomes equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature of the thermoplastic resin in the compression forming step the compression nested block B can be pressed to the thermoplastic resin composition while the thermoplastic resin contained in the thermoplastic resin composition is in the melted state so that the melted thermoplastic resin composition can be introduced into the grooves on the compression nested block B. In the compressing device since the temperature of the molding die is set to equal to or lower than the crystallization temperature with the thermoplastic resin composition being introduced into the grooves of the compression nested block B the grooves formed on the compression nested block B are securely transcribed to the thermoplastic resin composition in the cavity space .

 7 In the present embodiment the molding die is carried to the respective devices and of the manufacturing machine .

Thus when the compressing device has a plurality of compression nested block B with a plurality of grooves having different shapes respectively a molding having grooves with different shapes can be manufactured by replacing the compression nested blocks B. In other words plural types of moldings can be manufactured in a manufacturing line.

 8 In the present embodiment that of the dent A of the molding body A of the cooling device is larger than the planer shape of the compression nested block B. The planar shape of the dent A of the molding body A is arranged to be larger than that of the compression nested block B so that a horizontal loading shearing force does not act on the compression nested block B when the compression nested block B is moved down and inserted into the dent A.

For instance in inserting the compression nested block B into the dent A of the molding die body A if the compression nested block B collides with the dent A of the molding die body A to cause the compression nested block B to be displaced the displacement of the compression nested block B might cause the grooves of the moldings to be broken.

In the present embodiment since the planar shape of the dent A of the molding body A is larger than that of the compression nested block B it is possible to prevent the dent A of the molding body A from colliding with the compression nested block B thus preventing the grooves or the like of the separator being broken.

Incidentally the present invention is not limited to the above described present embodiments but includes modifications and improvements as long as the objects of the present invention can be achieved.

For instance although the number of each of the heating device the filling device the compressing device and the cooling device of the manufacturing machine is only one in the above described embodiment the number of the compressing device and the cooling device may be two or more.

The number of each of the devices and is preferably adjusted in consideration of a time taken for each step. For instance when a compression time of the compressing device is 10 seconds while a cooling time of the cooling device is 20 seconds it is preferable to provide two cooling devices as shown in . Further if it takes long to heat the molding die there may be provided a plurality of the heating devices .

By adjusting the number of each of the devices and in consideration of the time taken for each step as described above the molding can be manufactured more smoothly which is suitable for mass manufacturing of the molding.

Also there may be provided a plurality of the mount tables of the transferring device of the filling device in consideration of the time taken for each step.

Although the molding die as a part of the dies is carried by the carrying device to the respective devices and in the above described embodiment the entire dies including the pair of molding dies may be carried to the respective devices.

In other words the pair of molding dies constituting the dies are carried. When the entire dies are carried a cavity space may be formed by a dent formed on one of the molding dies and a dent formed on the other molding die.

Shapes of the fuel cell polymer electrolyte fuel cell and the separator refer to to which the present invention is applied in the above described embodiment is only an example so that arbitrary arrangements and shapes can be employed without limiting to the shapes of the above described embodiment.

Specific arrangements and shapes in implementing the present invention may be other arrangements or the like as long as the object of the present invention can be attained.

Although the size of the plurality of grooves formed on the fuel cell separator has the size of 2 mm in width 0.5 mm in depth and 200 mm in length in the above described embodiment the size is not limited thereto.

As shown in the groove formed on the separator as the molding is preferably arranged so that the widths L of bottom parts of protruded treads sandwiched between the grooves are 0 to 10 mm the widths L of tops of the protruded treads are 0 to 10 mm required to be L L the heights H of the protruded treads are 0.2 mm or more the widths W of the grooves are 5 mm or less and pitch P between the grooves is 15 mm or less.

Although the vertical cross section of the protruded tread is quadrate in any shape can be employed such as rectangle trapezoid semi sphere triangle and semi sphere with a part thereof being cut.

Although the fuel cell separator is exemplified as the molding in the above described embodiment the flat antenna the radiator plate or the like may be manufactured as the molding.

In molding the flat antenna for instance fillers having a high dielectric constant high dielectric constant filler highly dielectric filler such as the calcium titanate the magnesium titanate the barium titanate the strontium titanate the neodymium titanate and the titanium oxide can be used as the thermally conductive filler having electrical conductivity. Shapes of the high dielectric constant fillers are preferably spherical and powdery with for instance the average particle size of 0.1 to 10 m.

In molding a radiator plate metal powders such as the gold powder the iron powder the copper powder and the nickel powder can be used as the thermally conductive filler having electrical conductivity. The average particle size of the metal powders may be around 0.1 to 10 m but 1 to 20 m should be more preferable in use.

The carrying device carries the molding die in the directions shown by the arrows Y in the above described embodiment there may be provided a turntable for rotating the carrying device . By setting the molding die on the turntable and rotating the turntable the molding device can be carried to the respective devices and arranged arcuately.

Although the filling device includes the transferring device in the above described embodiment the transferring device may not be provided and instead the molding die may be directly mounted on the table by the carrying device .

Although the filling device includes the extruding device in the above described embodiment the filling device may alternatively include an injection compressing device.

The present invention will be described below in more detail with examples and comparisons the examples or the like does not limit the present invention.

Components as shown below in 1 to 4 were mixed and dry blended uniformly using Super Floater mixer vibration mixer manufactured by KAWATA MFG. Co. Ltd. and then melted and kneaded using a twin screw kneading extruder TEM35B manufactured by Toshiba Machine Co. Ltd at melting temperature of 300 to 330 C. and extruded in a pellet form to manufacture a polyphenylene sulfide PPS resin composition as the thermoplastic resin composition.

With the thermoplastic resin composition PPS resin composition same in the following description the injection compression molding method of the present invention was performed using an injection compression molding machine having the injection compression molding unit shown in AZ 7000 manufactured by Nissei Plastic Industrial Co. Ltd. Clamping force 350 tons in accordance with an injection filling step and a compression forming step described below to obtain a platy molding size 200 mm in length 300 mm in width 1.5 mm in thickness of the present invention

In the injection compression unit shown in the melted thermoplastic resin composition was injected and filled in the cavity space of the dies so that the thickness of the platy molding would be 2.0 mm. Incidentally the dies were clamped with low pressure of the clamping force of 50 tons in the injection filling step the cavity space started moving one second after the starting filling of the thermoplastic resin composition and the filling of the thermoplastic resin composition was completed simultaneously with the completion of the movement of the cavity space.

Once the melted thermoplastic resin composition was filled in the dies in the above described the injection filling step the dies were clamped with the high pressure of the clamping force of 350 tons as shown in simultaneously with the completion of the filling and then the compression block was moved forward to compress and form the thermoplastic resin composition in the cavity space of the dies with a compression speed of 2 mm sec and a resin pressure during compression of 58 MPa.

Then after the compression forming step the dies were cooled at 200 C. for about 60 seconds to solidify the thermoplastic resin composition in the dies and the solidified composition was removed from the dies to obtain the platy molding of the present invention.

Injection compression molding was performed in accordance with Example 1 described above except that a position of the cavity space was fixed instead of being moved to mold a platy molding. Incidentally the cylinder temperature was 320 C. and the die temperature was 200 C. It was so set that then an initial thickness was 2.0 mm a filling time was 1.5 mm a filling pressure was 260 MPa at maximum and the compression was started simultaneously when a screw position reaches a pressure keeping switch position. The gate was a side gate.

A platy molding was obtained by an injection molding method in which the thermoplastic resin composition was injected filled and cooled without performing the compression forming step in Comparison 1. Incidentally the cylinder temperature was 320 C. and the die temperature was 200 C. The filling pressure was set to 260 MPa at maximum and the gate was a side gate.

Volume resistivity and thickness distribution were measured for the platy moldings obtained from Example 1 Comparison 1 and Comparison 2 by a method described below. The results were shown in Tables 1 and 2.

A 50 mm square sample was taken from each of three measurement points at directly below the side gate a central part and an end part a part remotest from the side gate and the volume resistivity of the samples were measured using a commercially available resistance meter LORESTA GP ASP probe manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation in compliance with JIS K 7194 and the four probe method. The results were shown in Table 1.

Incidentally in Example 1 since the cavity space was moved the side gate was not used but samples were taken from positions similar to that in Comparison 1 or the like on the platy molding.

Thickness of arbitrary three points on the 50 mm square samples used in the volume resistivity measurement three samples from each of the Example and Comparisons namely thickness of nine points were measured using a commercially available micrometer 1 100 mm to check the maximum value the minimum value and the deviation obtained by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value . The results were shown in Table 2.

As indicated by the results in Tables 1 and 2 the platy molding obtained in Example 1 using the injection compression molding method of the present invention had equal volume resistivity at all of the three points and the value was 30 m cm which is low. Regarding the thickness of the molding differences of the maximum value and the minimum value from a set value and the deviation were small which showed good thickness distribution.

Thus it was verified that the platy molding of Example 1 had good thickness distribution and had almost no density gradient with the electrically conductive filler dispersed uniformly and further had high electrical conductivity.

On the other hand the platy molding obtained in Comparison 1 using a conventional injection compression molding method the volume resistivities at directly below the gate and the central part were larger than that of the end part so that the volume resistivites in the molding were not equal. Further the values were 40 to 45 m cm which is higher than the result of the platy molding of Example 1 and the electrical conductivity of which was inferior to that of Example 1. The variation of the thickness distribution was also large and inferior to that of Example 1.

In the platy molding obtained in Example 2 using a conventional injection molding method the end part of the gate was left unfilled and the molding could not be obtained properly. Further the volume resistivity was 80 m m and high so that the electrical conductivity was low. The thickness distribution was also larger than and inferior to that of Example 1 and Comparison 1.

In the injection compression molding method shown in Example 1 the injection compression molding was performed with the angle of the gate relative to the moving direction of the cavity space being 45 Example 2 90 right angle relative to the moving direction Example 3 and 135 Example 4 to obtain the platy molding. In Example 2 the filling of the cavity space was performed properly without formation of the weld marks and fine weld marks were not observed either on a surface of the obtained platy molding.

It was verified that by setting the angle of the gate to 45 acute angle relative to the moving direction of the cavity space the filling pressure of the resin filled in the cavity space can be lowered so that generation of the fine weld marks could be prevented.

On the other hand in Example 3 generation of the weld marks were observed during the filling and the fine weld marks were also generated on a surface of the obtained platy molding. In Example 4 generation of the weld marks was significant as compared to Example 3.

According to the molding method of the present invention the grooves can be properly transcribed even with low die temperature normal die temperature for PPS 120 to 150 C. . In order to verify the characteristic a test described below was conducted.

Clearly chipped parts that could be visually observed were employed as the chipped part of the grooves.

When unfilled part was remained an area of grooves on the unfilled molding was employed as the total area of the grooves.

Chips on the grooves were significantly generated on the grooves intersecting with a flowing direction of the thermoplastic resin composition.

In Comparison 3 an unfilled part was generated even though the filling pressure was increased and the transcription rate of the groove was 30 .

In Comparison although the filling could be completed by raising the die temperature the transcription rate of the grooves was 80 .

Therefore it was verified that the transcription performance of the grooves could also be enhanced by the present invention. Further a sufficient transcription performance can be achieved without raising the die temperature around melting point of PPS 280 C. unlike the conventional method so that the molding cycle can be shortened.

In Test 2 it was verified that generation of the weld marks could be prevented by setting the gate angle to an acute angle in the molding method of the present invention. Further in order to verify how the gate angle influenced the transcription performance of the grooves the following test was conducted.

Molding method gate angle 45 acute angle the cavity space was moved from the left to the right as shown in .

Molding method gate angle obtuse angle the gate was moved in the cavity space from the right to the left which was opposite to .

In Example 7 the transcription rate of the grooves was 20 and the chips on the grooves were significant.

Therefore it was verified that the transcription performance could also be enhanced by setting the gate angle to an acute angle in the present invention.

An injection compression molding method of the present invention is capable of performing an injection compression molding of a thermoplastic resin composition containing a high content of a thermally conductive filler such as an electrically conductive filler so that the present invention is applicable to manufacturing a molding such as fuel cell separator and a flat antenna.
