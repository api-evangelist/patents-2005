This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 586 541 filed Jul. 9 2004 entitled Systems and Methods to Analyze Database Data the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject invention relates generally to databases and more particularly toward multidimensional database query systems and methods

Data warehousing and online analytical processing OLAP are widespread technologies employed to support business decisions and data analysis. A data warehouse is a nonvolatile repository for an enormous volume of organizational or enterprise information e.g. 100 MB TB . These data warehouses are populated at regular intervals with data from one or more heterogeneous data sources for example from multiple transactional systems. This aggregation of data provides a consolidated view of an organization from which valuable information can be derived. Though the sheer volume can be overwhelming the organization of data can help ensure timely retrieval of useful information.

Data warehouse data is often stored in accordance with a multidimensional database model. Conceptually in multidimensional database systems data is represented as cubes with a plurality of dimensions and measures rather than relational tables with rows and columns. A cube includes groups of data such as three or more dimensions and one or more measures. Dimensions are a cube attribute that contains data of a similar type. Each dimension has a hierarchy of levels or categories of aggregated data. Accordingly data can be viewed at different levels of detail. Measures represent real values which are to be analyzed. The multidimensional model is optimized to deal with large amounts of data. In particular it allows users execute complex queries on a data cube. OLAP is almost synonymous with multidimensional databases.

OLAP is a key element in a data warehouse system. OLAP describes category of technologies or tools utilized to retrieve data from a data warehouse. These tools can extract and present multidimensional data from different points of view to assist and support managers and other individuals examining and analyzing data. The multidimensional data model is advantageous with respect to OLAP as it allows users to easily formulate complex queries and filter or slice data into meaningful subsets among other things. There are two basic types of OLAP architectures MOLAP and ROLAP. MOLAP Multidimensional OLAP utilizes a true multidimensional database to store data. ROLAP Relational OLAP utilizes a relational database to store data but is mapped so that an OLAP tool sees the data as multidimensional. HOLAP Hybrid OLAP is an amalgam of both MOLAP and ROLAP.

Multidimensional databases and other databases modeled as multidimensional employ a multidimensional query language such as MDX MultiDimensional eXpressions to retrieve and interact with data. More specifically data can be retrieved utilizing the query language to define or describe specifically the data to be retrieved i.e. declarative language for example employing select where and from clauses. Subsequently an execution engine receives the query definition and returns the requested data.

The following presents a simplified summary of the invention in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the invention. This summary is not an extensive overview of the invention. It is not intended to identify key critical elements of the invention or to delineate the scope of the invention. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the invention in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.

Briefly described the subject invention concerns an object model and extension of a multidimensional query language including but not limited to MDX. The object model exposes query language objects to facilitate support of object oriented procedural programs. Thus programmers are able to employ procedural code against a multidimensional database for example employing such languages as C C Java and the like. Extending multidimensional database query languages to support both declarative and procedure code expands the power of a query language. Such increased power can enable users to easily tailor multidimensional queries and associated functionality to their own business model and analytical needs among other things.

According to an aspect of the invention a computer program system for interacting with multidimensional databases and data formats is disclosed. The system can include an object model that exposes multidimensional query language objects a receiver component that receives procedural code based on the object model as well as a compilation component that compiles the received code into a computer executable format.

In accordance with another aspect of the invention the disclosed object model can include a context object. The context object enables a procedure to capture the current context during the execution of a query and ultimately utilize it. The context object can include but is not limited to such properties identifying the current cube the current database the pass number and the current server. The context can be employed to enable generation of conditional code that depends of the context of execution.

According to yet another aspect of the invention procedural language procedures routines or functions can be stored for example one a server and accessed via calls invoking such procedures from a multidimensional query. Consequently the subject invention also provides systems and methods to support stored procedures.

According to an aspect of the invention a deployment system and method are provided. The deployment system includes a development component for specifying a procedure and a compiler component that compiles the procedure and stores the compiled code e.g. binary file dll . . . to a data store such as one associated with a server or more particularly an OLAP server.

In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention query processing systems and methods disclosed. These systems and methods provide mechanisms and means to query multidimensional data utilizing both declarative and procedural query statements alone or in combination.

The term article of manufacture as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer readable device carrier or media. For example computer readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices e.g. hard disk floppy disk magnetic strips . . . optical disks e.g. compact disk CD digital versatile disk DVD . . . smart cards and flash memory devices e.g. card stick key drive . . . . Additionally it should be appreciated that a carrier wave can be employed to carry computer readable electronic data such as those used in transmitting and receiving electronic mail or in accessing a network such as the Internet or a local area network LAN . Of course those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope or spirit of the subject invention.

Turning initially to a programmatic system for interaction with multidimensional data is depicted in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. System includes a receiver component a multidimensional object model and a compilation component . Receiver component receives source code in an object oriented procedural programming language alone or in combination with a declarative programming language. In accordance with an aspect of the invention the source code received by receiver component pertains to interaction with multidimensional data. Multidimensional data includes multidimensional database data formats. In particular multidimensional data is organized logically in cubes with a plurality of dimensions levels members and measures among other things. Accordingly code component can receive source code in procedural languages including but not limited to C Java and Visual Basic alone or in combination with declarative languages such as MDX Multidimensional Expressions . MDX is a declarative language specifically designed to make access of multidimensional data from cubes dimensions and the like both easy and intuitive. Multidimensional object model also referred to herein simply as object model encapsulates and exposes objects and functionality of a declarative query language such as MDX to object oriented procedural languages such as but not limited to C Visual Basic C and Java. For instance object model can include a collection of classes defining functions and or procedures provided by a declarative language and relationships amongst the classes. The source code obtained by code receiver component can be passed or transmitted via data packets to compilation component . Compilation component converts the high level source code into computer readable machine code. This compiled code can then be stored and or executed by a computer as defined infra thereby transforming the computer into a specialized machine. Object model can be compiled together with or linked to the source code thus enabling specification and execution of multidimensional functions and procedures. Of course the compiler component can also load link or otherwise interact with other objects models libraries and the like associated with one or more procedure programming languages that the compilation component can compile.

Dimension object can have properties such as name unique name description parent cube dimension type write enabled and caption. Name can be a string identify for the dimension object name. Unique name can be a string providing a unique identifier for the object. Description can be a string providing a description of the object. The parent cube property can be utilized to identify the parent cube for the dimension object. Dimension type can be an enumerator providing the dimension type. Write enabled can be a Boolean value specifying whether the dimension can be written. Caption can be a string providing a caption for the current locale. The illustrated hierarchy also provides that the dimension object can include hierarchies attribute hierarchies and properties.

Hierarchy object can include properties such as name unique name for object description parent dimension default member display folder caption and hierarchy origin. Default member can be a string unique name for the default member of the hierarchy. Display folder can be a string identifying a display folder for the hierarchy. The hierarchy identifies that the hierarchy object can include collections such as levels and properties.

Level object can include properties such as name unique name description parent hierarchy level type member count level number and caption. Member count is the exact count of members on the level. Level number can be an integer specifying the distance between the level and the root of the hierarchy. Level objects can also include collections of level properties for the level as well as properties of the collection. Level objects can further include a number of methods. For example level objects can include a GetMembers method with various parameters to retrieve levels or dimension members.

Member object can include properties such as name unique name description parent level parent caption level depth child count drilled down level depth level name and type. The member object can also include collections member properties where every member property of the member is exposed and properties.

Measure object can also include a myriad of properties such as name unique value caption display folder description numeric precision numeric scale units expression and parent cube. It should further be appreciated that the remaining objects named set KPI mining model mining service and mining structure can all include one or more of a plurality of properties collections and methods associated with MDX.

MDXValue object indicates that the object model supports MDX values. The MDXValue object has no public properties methods or collections. It is the return type from MDX functions and can be converted or cast to other types for further manipulation in stored procedure code for instance.

MDX object simply indicates the names space for using MDX functions. This removes the need to precede every function name with the MDXFunction by declaring it as a namespace. The following example uses the cross join function to create a set object 

Object model can also include a context object . The context object enables a procedure to obtain current context during the execution of a query and make use of it. The context object need not be explicitly passed or returned by a procedure. It can be available during execution of the procedure. Furthermore it can be a read only value s . The context object can include a plurality of properties. For example the context object can include properties including but not limited to current cube current database name pass and current server id. The current cube property can identify the cube for current query context. Current database name can be a property that identifies as the name suggests the current database. The pass property can be an integer that specifies the pass number for the current context. A pass can correspond to a stage of computation or calculation. The pass number can start at zero and be incremented for each calculation pass. The current server id property can be a string that specifies or identifies the current server or instance name.

One significant power of the context object in the object model can be with respect to a current tuple property. Through the current property for example one can reach the current member property in every dimension. The tuple type can include a set of members and from each member there can be a member object as previously described . From that member object one can find all relevant properties such as its level hierarchy dimension member properties and so forth. Accordingly code can be written or specified to act conditionally depending on for instance the member from a certain dimension being analyzed.

Consider the following pseudo code example where a procedure is designed to take code path conditional based on whether TimeDimension s CurrentMember is the DefaultMember for the hierarchy.

Turning to a procedure deployment system is depicted in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. System includes development component compiler component and data store . Development component facilitates generation of procedural language procedures routines or functions. Accordingly development component can be a source code editor. Users can employ development component to produce one or more routines or extensions utilizing a procedural language e.g. C C Java . . . and an object model that includes objects supporting a multidimensional database query type system such as MDX. Furthermore it should be noted that the routines could employ the context object described supra to enable generation of conditional extension code that depends on the context in which the extension is executing. Compiler component can receive or retrieve a produced function compile such function and generate an object file or an executable. The compiler component can subsequently save or upload the compiled extension to data store . In accordance with an aspect of the invention database can be part of a server such as an OLAP server. Storage of the compiled function to the database makes the extension available for employment by later queries. Finally it should be appreciated that while illustrated separately development component and compiler component can be incorporated into a single system such as an integrated development environment IDE .

To further clarify the operation of system consider the following example Assume that the interface component received the MDX query Select my stored procedure args on 0 from Sales. The parser component can receive this query and identify the extension component my stored procedure args . This extension can be provided to the formula component which sends it the execution engine . Execution engine can located and then execute the procedure based on the arguments provided. Thereafter the result or result object for instance the MDX Set object can be return to the formula component . The formula component can then pass and the query component can receive the result of the extension execution. A new declaratory query can then be generated by the query component incorporating the extension result Select result object on 0 from Sales. Query results can then be passed back to the query component which passes it to the interface component which can ultimately output the result to the requesting entity.

Furthermore it should be noted that the objects in the object model can be passed as parameters to store procedures or extensions as well as returned as results therefrom. Thus in the case of MDX syntax invocation of an extension or stored procedure does not differ from invocation of any other MDX function which takes MDX objects as parameters and returns one or more MDX objects as a result.

As with all system figures it should be appreciated that one or more components illustrated and or described as separate and distinct components can be combined into one or a lesser number of components providing the same aggregate functionality. Figures are illustrated herein to facilitated clarity and understanding. However other combinations aggregations or even additional components are contemplated and within the scope of the subject invention. With respect to system the query component and the formula engine as well as the query execution engine and the execution engine can be combined such that there is one component that passes a query including procedural calls or invocations and another component that executes the query and procedural calls.

Turning to a multidimensional database interaction system is illustrated in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. System can include a set of two interfaces namely user interface and system interface component to facilitate interaction with a multidimensional database system that process queries that include procedural routine calls or the like. User Interface component receives multidimensional queries from users or other entities. In particular interface component can receive multidimensional declarative queries that include calls to procedural functions or routines. According to an aspect of the invention the query can be an MDX query for example Select procedure args on 0 from Sales. System interface component receives the multidimensional query from the user interface component and returns the results of such a query. These results can be provided back to the user interface component . The user interface component can then provide the results back to the query submitting entity. According to an aspect of the invention user interface component and system interface component can be separate application programming interfaces or subcomponents for single application interface providing aggregate functionality.

In view of the exemplary systems described supra methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the present invention will be better appreciated with reference to the flow charts of . While for purposes of simplicity of explanation the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the order of the blocks as some blocks may in accordance with the present invention occur in different orders and or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Moreover not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodology in accordance with the present invention.

Additionally it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers. The term article of manufacture as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer readable device carrier or media.

Turning to a method of querying multidimensional data is illustrated in accordance with an aspect of the subject invention. At a query is received that includes a procedure or procedure call. Stated differently rather than the being purely declarative the query can include procedural elements such as routines functions or references thereto. These procedural elements facilitate algorithmic manipulation of multidimensional entities e.g. cubes dimensions members sets tuples . . . via objects. In particular declarative query functionality for instance defined by MDX can be exposed to object oriented procedural languages through an object model as described herein. According to one aspect of the invention the object model can include a context object that can be employed to allow execution of conditional procedures or functions based on the context of execution. At an execution engine can execute the received query on a database e.g. relational multidimensional hybrid . . . . According to an aspect of the invention the execution engine can be tightly integrated with the object model thereby allowing efficient execution of one or both of declarative and procedural query statements. As will be described in the later sections the queries can include calls to stored procedures which the execution engine can invoke together with declarative statements. At the results of the query can be returned to the requesting entity. For example the results can be provided to another program for further calculation or interpretation or presented via display to one or more users.
