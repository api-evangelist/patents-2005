This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 563 138 entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR CONDUCTING A GAME filed on Apr. 16 2004 and this application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The field of the invention relates generally to gaming and more particularly to games of skill and or chance.

Casino games are popular and recently many varieties of new casino games have been introduced especially those that can be played over a network such as the Internet. These games allow in some jurisdictions players to make bets and win prizes as if they were playing in a casino. The Internet has gained a great deal of popularity on certain betting card games such as blackjack. The rules of these types of games are similar to those played in a casino and therefore these games have similar odds of winning as casino games.

Poker arguably the most popular gambling game in America has largely been ignored by casinos. The basic reasons for this are that casino poker games are slower and offer lower proportional winnings than other casino games and thus are less exciting for the players and less profitable for the casinos. Playing action in poker is slow because each player must make a decision for each round of betting and or discarding and the casino player must shuffle the cards deal to each player calculate the house cut from the pot and make change for the players. Also because poker is a game of chance whose odds of winning may be dramatically increased by various playing strategies and card counting the casual player often feels intimidated when playing against strangers some of whom may be experts. The game of poker has been extended in various forms to in casino machines that may be played for money e.g. video poker . Similarly poker games have been extended to be played over networks such as the Internet both as games of pure entertainment and gambling. Also on the Internet there are other games of skill e.g. video games that players may play for entertainment. These games may be played for example within an Internet browser program executing on a personal computer a cell phone PDA or other system.

In such traditional forms of poker and other types of games winning or losing by a player is determined by each individual round of play. Thus if a player faces a large loss in an individual game session he she is discouraged from proceeding in further sessions for fear that he she may lose additional money.

There is a need for new games of skill and chance especially those that can involve wagering or gambling. However in traditional gambling or wagering games players are often intimidated by a single loss string of losses or the skill of other players playing the game and as a result many players stop playing such games. According to one aspect of the present invention a new game format is provided that extends the risk of losing a wager over a longer period of time or game sessions. In this manner the player is motivated to continue playing the game as the risk of losing is protracted over a longer period of time or over multiple gaming sessions.

In another aspect of the present invention a prize is awarded to a player that achieves a particular result at the end of a number of gaming sessions. These sessions may be for example traditional or modified casino type games such as blackjack poker etc. or may be games of skill such as video games or other type games adapted for play on one or more computer systems. Such a game format is beneficial as a player is generally less intimidated in playing such games and is more likely to play such games rather than games in a casino type format where money may be lost in individual sessions. Further such a game format may also be more favorably viewed by people opposed to gaming. Also such a game format may be more compliant with gaming laws in particular jurisdictions.

According to one aspect of the present invention players compete in a race and generally attempt to become the sole or co winner in the race. In one example advancement in the race is determined by the result of a number of gaming sessions the result of each session determining the advancement of individual players in the race. For example if a player wins a particular gaming session that player may be advanced within the overall race. A winner of the race may be determined for example as the first to finish the race e.g. advance to a predetermined level or be the player in a leading position at a point when the race is terminated e.g. after a particular period of time or after a particular number of game sessions . If a player loses an individual session there is less disincentive to quit the game as the risk of losing is spread over a longer period of time or number of gaming sessions. The player will have for example in a subsequent gaming session to advance within the race and catch up to other players.

According to another aspect of the present invention the individual game sessions may be games having fixed odds. These games may be played for example in a casino environment or outside a casino. For instance a player may subscribe to play multiple game sessions inside a casino or other legal gambling jurisdiction and play the game outside of the jurisdiction. In one aspect the games played outside of the legal gambling jurisdiction may be a game of chance where the player cannot influence the outcome of the game. Because the player pays for the game within the legal gambling jurisdiction and the play of the player has no influence over the outcome of the game play of the game outside of the legal gambling jurisdiction may be permitted. In some jurisdictions the player may be limited to subscribing to the multiple game sessions and receiving winnings within a casino or other legal gambling jurisdiction.

According to another aspect of the present invention the game sessions include a game of guts poker as referred to in the art. Guts poker is a card game wherein each player seeks to obtain the best hand possible from an initial dealing of cards without drawing additional cards. In a conventional game of two card guts poker the dealer deals two cards to each player. If both cards in the player s hand match then that player has a pair. Otherwise the hand is called simply by the high card between the two. Although two card guts poker is common guts poker can be played with any number of cards the Monte Carlo version of guts poker involves dealing three cards . In another example a game five card guts poker may be played.

In any conventional version of guts poker each player decides whether or not they will go in or out . Those players who are out have no further stake in the game unless the hand is re dealt. Of those players who are in the one with the best hand collects the pot while the others who called in throw into the pot the amount of money that the winner has collected.

In one aspect of the present invention the game of guts poker is a pure game of chance e.g. the outcome of the game may not be influenced by game play of the player . In this manner the game may be subscribed to in a legal gambling jurisdiction and played outside of it. For instance the player may play and or view game sessions from a remote location e.g. through a computer coupled to a game server through the Internet . For instance the game of guts poker may be modified to eliminate player decisions that influence outcomes e.g. by removing the decision of whether to go in or out of a particular hand . For example the player may always be in for each subscribed game sessions or may be declared in or out e.g. by a game playing computer based on a predetermined set of rules.

In one example of such a guts poker game different possible poker hands may be assigned different point values and a winning hand e.g. among a number of players may be correlated to an advancement in the race. For instance a possible hand that has more difficult odds of being obtained may be attributed to a higher advancement in the race. For example the player may be advanced a farther distance than an inferior hand of another player. Alternatively only the winning player in each session may be advanced some token advancement. Players may be randomly assigned a hand e.g. by dealing cards from a 52 card deck as in conventional poker and the player having the winning hand may be advanced in the race.

There may be more than one session of the game played periodically. For instance guts poker sessions may occur once every M minutes or D times per day. Accordingly there may be intermediate prizes that are awarded e.g. daily prizes for top scores fixed odds payouts etc. . Top scorer prizes may be funded for example by a hold percentage of the player s subscription for playing in multiple game sessions. For instance the top N percentage of scores may be paid out T percentage of revenues. As a result payouts and winners are expanded and contract along with the number of subscribers. If for example 10 of scores are paid 40 of revenues and if there are 100 subscribers that pay 10 each then the top ten scores are paid collectively 400 . In the event of tie scores the two or more tied players evenly split the payouts owed to the slots trailing the tier. For instance if three 3 players tie for second place those three players split evenly payouts owed to the second third and fourth place.

According to another aspect of the invention fixed odds payouts may include for example session outcomes e.g. a hand in a poker game that meet particular criteria. For instance if a player achieves a royal flush that player may be awarded a fixed odds payout. Such payouts may be independent of any other standing in the overall race or other payout. Fixed odds payouts may also include prizes awarded during particular periods of time. For instance if a player is dealt a certain hand at a certain time e.g. four aces on November 11 11 11 the player is awarded a prize.

According to one aspect of the invention a method of conducting a game comprises acts of providing for an entry of a player into a plurality of game sessions providing for a race between the player and one or more other players and playing by the player in at least one of the plurality of game sessions having at least one outcome wherein the at least one outcome of at least one of the plurality of game sessions determines an advancement of the player in the race.

Further features and advantages of the present invention as well as the structure of various embodiments of the present invention will be more fully understood from the examples described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following examples are intended to illustrate the benefits of the present invention but do not exemplify the full scope of the invention. All references cited herein are expressly incorporated by reference.

According to one aspect a new game and system and method for conducting the game is provided. A new game format is provided that extends the risk of losing a wager over a longer period of time or game sessions. In this manner the player is motivated to continue playing the game as the risk of losing is protracted over a longer period of time or over multiple gaming sessions. In another aspect of the present invention a prize is awarded to a player that achieves a particular result at the end of a number of gaming sessions. This new game format may be implemented with one or more types of casino games e.g. poker blackjack games of skill e.g. video games or games of chance.

Such a new game format may be performed on one or more general purpose computer systems as discussed further below in relation to . More particularly a gaming system may be provided that conducts a game having one or more players. In the game players compete in a number of gaming sessions to achieve an ultimate goal. In one embodiment the ultimate goal is to win a race with the players progress in the race being influenced by each players success within individual game sessions. These game sessions may be for example casino type games as discussed above video games or other game type. However in one embodiment at least one of the game sessions is a guts poker game played among a number of players.

System includes an interface that interacts with a user e.g. a player to place bets and communicate information relating to a game session. Interface may be for example an interface of a computer system. In one particular example interface may include an interface presented by a browser program operating in a memory of a computer system.

System may also include a game processor which performs functions relating to one or more game sessions. Game processor may be for example a process executing in a memory of system . Processor may receive and process bets placed by users through interface conduct game sessions and rules of the game and determine wins and payouts to players.

Information relating to game sessions may be stored in one or more storage entities e.g. a device such as a disk associated with system . Storage may for example store information directly relating to game play e.g. a number of players current score current state of game play or other information relating to game play and payment.

System may also include a payment component that receives payment information from a user through interface to pay for bets placed by the player. Payments may include for example wagers placed by players or any additional bets paid by a player in association with playing a game. These bets may include for example subscription fees provided by a player for playing multiple game sessions additional side bets or other wagers. Payment component may communicate with one or more payment systems for the purpose of obtaining payment for playing the game.

As discussed above a new game format may be provided that allows players to play against each other in multiple game sessions to achieve a multiple session goal. An example process for playing a number of game sessions involving a multiple session goal is shown in . At block process begins. At block a player is provided the option to enter into multiple game sessions. Entry of the player may be facilitated for example by an interface presented by a gaming system e.g. system . In one embodiment the player pays a subscription fee for entering into the multiple game sessions. This fee may be paid for example in a legal jurisdiction such as a casino where gambling or gaming is permitted.

At block a system e.g. system conducts multiple game sessions. These game sessions may be played through one or more computer systems by multiple players.

At block it is determined whether any player has achieved the multiple session goal. As discussed above for example the ultimate goal may be winning a race e.g. a horse race held between players but the goal may be any competition goal that measures the relative success of a number of players. As an alternative for example the goal may be a particular number of points or number of sessions won by any particular player.

If at block no player has achieved the goal game play is continued. Game play may also be limited by time e.g. a timed game or limited by a total number of sessions conducted within the overall game. For instance a game may include ten 10 game sessions and after the ten game sessions are conducted the overall game is ended and a winner is determined. Other limitations may determine how long the game is conducted and the invention is not limited to any particular method.

If at block a player has achieved the multiple session goal a prize may be awarded to the winning player. Payout may be one of many types as discussed in more detail below. At block process ends.

At block the player is initialized in the race between a number of players. For instance each of the players may be initialized to the same starting point in the race. Alternatively players may be started at different points e.g. in a handicap situation . Each of the players compete against one another to win the race.

At block the players are entered to play in the next game session. Game sessions may be for example conducted periodically e.g. once every predetermined number of minutes or number of times per day . Game sessions may be consecutive or may have some delay scheduled between them. A game system e.g. system may conduct the game sessions and interact with players to conduct each session.

At block it is determined whether a player has achieved the winning outcome in a particular game session. In the case of guts poker for example the player having the highest ranked hand may be selected as the winner of the particular session. As discussed a guts poker game using five cards may be played and points may be attributed to different possible poker hands. If for instance the player achieves a hand having the highest point total that player may be indicating as winning the particular session.

If the player has achieved a winning outcome the player is advanced within the race at block . In one example only the winner in each session is advanced by some token advancement in the race e.g. an advancement of one unit . Alternatively hands may be assigned particular advancements and each player is advanced by an amount correlated to the particular hand that was achieved. For instance a royal flush may be correlated to an advancement of five units whereas a lower ranking hand such as a three of a kind may be correlated to an advancement of three units. It should be appreciated that any advancement scheme may be used and the invention is not limited to any particular scheme.

In one embodiment the progress of the race may be visually indicated to each player e.g. in an interface of a computer system . The race may be for example represented visually as a horse race between players and each player may be graphically represented in the race by a token which is advanced or not advanced with the outcome of each game session.

At block it is determined whether there is a winner in the race. This may be determined for example by a particular player achieving a particular goal e.g. total number of points exceeding a predetermined amount number of wins etc. or achieving a particular standing within a set amount of time e.g. in a timed game or within a fixed number of sessions e.g. a subscription period lasting over a day a week a month etc. .

At block the system e.g. system awards one or more prizes to one or more players. The prize may be in the form of a payment credit or other type as discussed further below. In a case that players tie prizes may be split among the tying players. At block process ends.

It should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to processes and as discussed above with reference to but rather these processes may include more or less acts or may perform them in different orders or frequencies. For instance the prizes may be awarded periodically during the game for different occurrences within the game or different session outcomes. For instance if in a guts poker game a player receives a royal flush then that player may be awarded a fixed odds payout which may be independent of any other payout for the player s standing in the overall race. Other fixed odds of payout may include prizes awarded during other particular periods of time during the game. For instance if a player is dealt a certain hand at a certain time e.g. four aces on November 11 11 11 the player is awarded a prize. Other payouts may be awarded within particular sessions to encourage players that are behind in the race to continue playing e.g. awarding larger one time payouts during later stages of the game .

In at least one of the game sessions the game played may be a game of chance developed from a wagering game of skill and chance that is played automatically according to a predetermined set of rules. Such games of skill may include card games such as poker and blackjack or other games such as dominoes craps or backgammon. Such games may be reduced to games of chance by removing the element of player skill and allowing such games to be played outside legal gaming jurisdictions. For instance in a game such as guts poker the element of choice by the player to go in or out of a hand based on the dealt cards may be eliminated to reduce the game to a game of chance. In another example choices made by the player may be made by a game playing computer according to a set of predetermined rules.

Prior to a game a game player may need to pay for playing. For example a game player may pay using money or loyalty points. In particular a game player may pay using money by debit card credit card check cash or from an account credit either with the gaming operator or an affiliated organization. Alternatively a game player may pay using loyalty points from an account held either by the gaming operator or by an affiliated organization. Loyalty points may be obtained from any type of organization but are generally associated with loyalty programs such as frequent flier programs for airlines frequent stay programs for hotels or frequent visitor programs for casinos. The game player may pay in person e.g. by using a cashier in a casino or through other remote methods including paying by telephone via a handheld device a kiosk a computer through the Internet or other network and mail. Payment may be in any form that is legal in the particular jurisdiction. Also rather than a player paying a set amount per game a player may instead open an account and place money or loyalty points in the account as credit.

In one embodiment of the invention players may subscribe to play in multiple game sessions. That is the player pays at one time to play more than one game. These games may be consecutive games periodically disbursed over a period of time or other distribution. According to one embodiment a player may subscribe to play multiple games using a computer based interface e.g. a personal computer a cell phone a PDA a set top box or other interface . These subscribed games may be automatically played e.g. by a computer system without the need to interact with the game provider. According to another embodiment the player may also choose to have his or her subscription automatically renewed. The player may also be able to manage his or her subscription including setting spending limits time out periods or password protection.

According to one embodiment of the invention a player may subscribe to a number of games to be played in the future in a place where wagering games are legal e.g. in a casino or jurisdiction where wagering is permitted and may observe and or play these subscribed games in another location e.g. on a computer coupled to the Internet on a cellular phone PDA or other system . In this manner the gaming experience may be extended beyond the legal jurisdiction. It is realized however that some jurisdictions require that the gaming activity be located within the jurisdiction and therefore one aspect of the present invention relates to locating the system responsible for accepting subscriptions from and making payments to players within a legal jurisdiction. Further according to one embodiment games of chance are provided that are developed from games of skill and chance and therefore the player through his her remote play does not influence the outcome of the game. Therefore because the system is located in a legal jurisdiction and the player does not influence the outcome of the game outside of the legal jurisdiction the wagering activity may be performed legally. Further the gaming experience is improved as familiar games of skill and chance are provided in a form that may be played from a remote location.

According to one embodiment of the invention players may also enter to play this or any other wagering game of chance using an alternative method of entry AMOE . AMOE is a required available method of entry that does not require a purchase to enter a sweepstake. Sweepstakes are usually used as a promotional or marketing tool. An individual entering a sweepstakes by AMOE is required by law to have the same odds of winning each of the available prizes.

A common AMOE method includes having an individual interested in entering the sweepstakes send in a postcard having his or her name address or other contact information. Another AMOE method includes having an individual sign on to a free Internet website and submit the required information without payment of a fee. Numerous other methods may be used for AMOE. Most sweepstakes limit the number of times one individual or family may enter a sweepstakes by AMOE.

According to one embodiment of the invention it is realized that an AMOE alternative method of entry may be used to enter a game of chance. More particularly it is possible to develop implement and run wagering games of chance including the inventive games described herein with an AMOE method of entry. AMOE methods are conventionally used to enter a player in a sweepstakes which is not considered wagering or gambling. Thus according to one embodiment of the invention an individual may enter a wagering game of chance by AMOE using for example the postcard or the online method outlined above. The wagering game of chance player entering by AMOE may also have the same odds to win the payout associated with the game in which they are entered. The wagering game of chance player entering by AMOE may also be limited to enter in a predetermined number of games within a given period of time. For example the AMOE entry may be limited to entry in one game in a period of one year two games in one month etc. Other numbers of sessions and given periods may be any number and the invention is not limited to any particular implementation.

According to one embodiment the game which the game player enters by AMOE may be determined by the game player on an AMOE entry form. For example a postcard AMOE may be required to state the date and the time of the game that the game player wants to enter. Alternatively the game entered by the player may be the next starting game after the AMOE entry form is received and logged. As another alternative AMOE entries may be assigned to a specific game s each hour day week or other time interval.

According to one embodiment a game also has a predetermined payout table associated with it. The payout table may include a listing of the possible methods of obtaining a payout and their payout ratios. The payout ratio is the payout amount in relation to the amount wagered. For instance if the payout ratio is 1.2 1 then a winning 1.00 bet has a payout of 1.20. The payout amount for each method of winning may depend upon but may not be rigidly determined by the odds of obtaining the particular way to obtain a winning outcome. In one embodiment the payout table may follow a standard payout schedule for playing the original wagering game of skill and chance. However because the odds for winning are lowered for the gaming operator in this invention the payout ratios may be adjusted for each method of winning.

The payout table may also be affected if the game is played against the gaming operator or against other players. Typically if the player is playing against the gaming operator then the payout table with the payout ratio discussed above may be used. However if the player is playing against other players then the payout may be determined by the total amount bet from all the players minus a predetermined commission paid to the gaming operator.

A payout table may also include adjustments for a player s subscription. For instance the payout may be adjusted according to the player s subscription level. For example the payout ratio may increase or the gaming operator commission may decrease if the player has a multiple game subscription multiple card subscription high payment per game card or hand or any combination of the three. The payout may also be adjusted for numerous other criterion including frequent player credits. Of course all payout adjustments must meet any legal requirements for the gaming jurisdiction in which the game is played.

A payout table for each game may also be supplemented by a jackpot that transfers from game session to game session. These types of jackpots are commonly referred to as rolling or progressive jackpots. A rolling jackpot may be for example the same amount that transfers from game session to game session or from race to race until it is paid out. A progressive jackpot is a rolling jackpot that increases as more game sessions are played or may be increased according to some other criterion. Rolling or progressive jackpots are typically paid out for a difficult way to win. For example a rolling jackpot may be paid to a player that obtains a royal flush in a poker game as it is realized that the odds of obtaining a royal flush are very small.

The final payout may also be affected by bonus play which is well known in the gaming industry. Bonus play generally works to increase some payouts by offering the chance to multiply a payout.

Once a player has paid or entered to play a game the player may place an opening bet or the computer may place the bet for the player if the player is placing a set bet per game. After the opening bet is placed the game is played according to the rules of the game being played. Once the game is started the game play and optionally the betting are partially or fully automated using one or more computer systems. Examples of such computer systems are more fully described below.

When a computer or gaming device plays a game automatically the computer may determine the play according to rules predetermined for the game. For instance these rules may be available for players to see in advance. Preferably the computer or gaming device determines the best play according to the rules for best play according to experts in the game. For example the best strategy for playing blackjack may be found at www.blackjackinfo.com. However it should be appreciated that any strategy may be used and the invention is not limited to any particular strategy.

It should be appreciated that the invention is not limited to any particular game but rather any game of skill and chance may be used to develop a game of chance that uses a set of predetermined rules for playing the game.

With blackjack poker and other games the computer may also automatically bet for the player after the initial ante. In blackjack the only possible additional bets in blackjack are determined by the initial ante. These bets are split double insurance and surrender. In traditional poker the bets are typically more freeform but if the computer plays and bets the game for a player then the predetermined rules may also include rules that determine how the computer will bet in particular situations.

The game player may view the game proceedings using television wireless or line telephone with display handheld device kiosk computer or in person. Depending upon the viewing medium it may be necessary to download game information prior to viewing while other viewing medium may allow viewing of the streamed game information. For example the game player may operate a computer that has an Internet enabled interface e.g. using Macromedia Flash or Java programming methods and the computer may display streamed game information within that interface. The game player may also decide not to watch. However according to one embodiment of the invention the player need not view the game session to win the game.

The computer system may automatically determine when a player is a winner. Such a result may be automatically authenticated and verified by the computer system. In this instance the computer system may then notify the game player that he or she has won and the winnings after the computer has consulted the predetermined payout table described above. The notification of winning to a game player may occur by mail e mail computer web or network telephone television pager fax kiosk or any other method.

One or more games may proceed concurrently the parameters of the concurrent game may be the same similar or different. Additionally the games may run continually i.e. one after another. When one game ends another game will begin immediately or in a short period of time. The games may follow a precise time schedule so that players know when games will begin. In one specific example if game play in a game requires four and a half 4.5 minutes to complete then the next game may start immediately or in thirty seconds to keep to a schedule of games every five minutes e.g. at 00 05 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 of each hour. Because the game sessions may run continually it may be possible that a game will have no game player playing in a particular game session.

When the computer system automatically determines the winner and play is conducted against other players the computer system may also determine the game s hand s or board s and the associated player identity ies that hold the best chance of winning or is the best at any moment during game play. The computer system may then display the game s hand s or board s or the identity of the game player s that is the best to all game players observing the game session. The computer system may also selectively display only one or a subset of all the best games hand s or board s or the associated player identity ies to a particular game player observing the game session. Additionally when the game is completed the computer system may display the winning game hand or board the winning player s identity and or the payout.

During the period of time between the games a game operator may make announcements rest or perform any number of actions. If the game is played using a computer system advertisements sponsorships public service announcements or any visual or auditory content may be inserted for example into one or more of these periods of time. Advertisements or other content may also be inserted into the game display during a game session.

If the computer automatically plays the games for the players a game player may access information regarding results of a game remotely after the game is completed. In this manner a player need not attend or view a particular game session as the results of each session may be accessed at a later time. Further the player need not access the game session results from the same interface at which the game was played or subscribed. Remote access may be gained for example by kiosk telephone television computer handheld device or any other device or system that is appropriate. Information that may be accessed about a past game session may include for example whether the player won or lost what the player s payout was or any other information relating to the past game session.

A game player may also be able to replay or review a past game session using a video enabled device. For instance a kiosk a telephone having a display a television a computer or handheld device may be used to replay a past game session. By accessing a selected game session in the computer system a game player may be able to see a past game as it occurred the winning game and winning game player identity ies or possibly any other aspect of the game of interest.
