title: Method and system for managing partitioned data resources
abstract: In a computing environment, a method for forming an association between a first data object and a second data object includes forming a first association fragment, where the first association fragment includes information relevant to accessing the first data object. The method also includes forming a second association fragment. The second association fragment may include information relevant to accessing the second data object. The first association fragment and the second association fragment cause an association to be effectively formed between the first data object and the second data object.
