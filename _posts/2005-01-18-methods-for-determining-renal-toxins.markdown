title: Methods for determining renal toxins
abstract: The present invention is based on the elucidation of the global changes in gene expression and the identification of toxicity markers in tissues or cells exposed to a known renal toxin. The genes may be used as toxicity markers in drug screening and toxicity assays. The invention includes a database of genes characterized by toxin-induced differential expression that is designed for use with microarrays and other solid-phase probes.
