The present invention relates to a laminated film for a dye sensitized solar cell to an electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell and to a process for their production.

Since the initial report of photogenerating transforming elements using dye sensitized semiconductor fine particles Nature Vol. 35 737 740 1991 dye sensitized solar cells have been the object of interest as new solar cells to serve as potential alternatives for silicon based solar cells. In particular dye sensitized solar cells employing plastic films as supports can be produced more flexibly and with lighter weights and they have therefore been extensively studied.

With dye sensitized solar cells employing plastic films as supports the difficulty of forming porous semiconductor layers on transparent conductive layers hampers efforts to ensure satisfactory adhesion between the transparent conductive layers and porous semiconductor layers. The lack of guaranteed sufficient adhesion leads to reduced photogenerating performance of the solar cell.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a laminated film for a dye sensitized solar cell and an electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell which have excellent adhesion between the transparent conductive layer and the porous semiconductor layer and allow formation of dye sensitized solar cells with high photogenerating performance.

The present invention further provides a process for production of an electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell which has excellent adhesion between the transparent conductive layer and the porous semiconductor layer.

Specifically the invention provides a laminated film for a dye sensitized solar cell characterized by comprising a polyester film and a transparent conductive layer formed on one side thereof the transparent conductive layer having a surface tension of 40 mN m or greater.

The invention also provides an electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell comprising the aforementioned laminated film for a dye sensitized solar cell and a porous semiconductor layer formed on its transparent conductive layer.

The invention further provides a process for production of an electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell characterized by forming a transparent conductive layer on one side of a polyester film having an absolute value of no greater than 0.8 for the difference in the heat shrinkage rates in the lengthwise direction and widthwise direction of the film upon treatment for 10 minutes at 200 C. and baking a metal oxide thereover at 170 250 C. to form a porous semiconductor layer.

According to the invention the polyester of the polyester film is a linear saturated polyester synthesized from an aromatic dibasic acid or its ester forming derivative and a diol or its ester forming derivative.

Specific examples of such polyesters include polyethylene terephthalate polyethylene isophthalate polyethylene isophthalate polybutylene terephthalate poly 1 4 cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate and polyethylene 2 6 naphthalate. Among these polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene 2 6 naphthalate are preferred for a satisfactory balance between dynamic properties and optical properties. In particular polyethylene 2 6 naphthalate is most preferred because of its high mechanical strength low heat shrinkage and low oligomer generation during heating.

The polyester may be a homopolymer or copolymer although a homopolymer is preferred. When the polyester is a copolymer the copolymerizing component is preferably used at no greater than 3 mole percent with respect to the total dicarboxylic acid component or total diol component.

When using a copolymerizing component the dicarboxylic component may be an aromatic dicarboxylic acid such as phthalic acid or 2 6 naphthalenedicarboxylic acid or an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid such as adipic acid azelaic acid sebacic acid or 1 10 decanedicarboxylic acid. Examples of diol components include aliphatic diols such as 1 4 butanediol 1 6 hexanediol and neopentyl glycol and alicyclic diols such as 1 4 cyclohexanedimethanol.

The polyester may be produced by a publicly known process. For example it may be produced by a process in which the dicarboxylic acid and diol are reacted to directly obtain a low polymerization degree polyester. Alternatively it may be produced by a process in which a lower alkyl ester of the dicarboxylic acid and the diol are subjected to ester exchange reaction with an ester exchange catalyst and then polymerization reaction is conducted in the presence of a polymerization catalyst to obtain a polyester. Examples of ester exchange catalysts that may be used include sodium potassium magnesium calcium zinc strontium titanium zirconium manganese and cobalt. Examples of polymerization catalysts that may be used include antimony trioxide antimony pentaoxide germanium dioxide tetraethyl titanate tetrapropyl titanate tetraphenyl titanate ammonium titanyloxalate potassium titanyloxalate and titanium trisacetylacetonate.

When ester exchange reaction is followed by polymerization reaction a phosphorus compound is preferably added to inactivate the ester exchange catalyst before polymerization. Examples of phosphorus compounds that may be used include trimethyl phosphate triethyl phosphate tri n butyl phosphate and orthophosphoric acid.

The intrinsic viscosity of the polyester is preferably 0.40 dl g or greater and more preferably 0.40 0.90 dl g. A viscosity of less than 0.40 dl g may result in numerous process interruptions while a viscosity of greater than 0.9 dl g will hamper melt extrusion and lengthen the polymerization time which is economically undesirable.

Preferably the polyester film of the invention contains substantially no particles. The presence of particles may impair high transparency roughen the surface and hamper working of the transparent conductive layer.

The polyester film of the invention preferably contains an ultraviolet absorber. Preferred ultraviolet absorbers for use are compounds represented by the following formula I .

Preferred ultraviolet absorbers among the compounds represented by formula I are 2 2 p phenylenebis 3 1 benzooxazin 4 one 2 2 p phenylenebis 6 methyl 3 1 benzooxazin 4 one 2 2 p phenylenebis 6 chloro 3 1 benzooxazin 4 one 2 2 4 4 di phenylene bis 3 1 benzooxazin 4 one and 2 2 2 6 naphthylene bis 3 1 benzooxazin 4 one .

The ultraviolet absorber content is preferably 0.1 5 wt and more preferably 0.2 3 wt with respect to 100 wt of the polyester in the polyester film. If the content is less than 0.1 it will not be possible to adequately lower the light transmittance at a wavelength of 370 nm and if it is greater than 5 wt the light transmittance at a wavelength of 400 nm will not be adequately increased.

The ultraviolet absorber may be added to the polyester film by for example a method of addition during polymerization of the polyester a method of kneading with the polyester polymer during the melting step before film formation or a method of impregnation into the film. Preferred among these is a method of kneading with the polyester polymer during the melting step before film formation. This method can prevent reduction in the polymerization degree of the polyester. Kneading of the ultraviolet absorber into the polyester polymer may be accomplished for example by a compound powder direct addition method or master batch method.

The polyester film of the invention has a light transmittance of no greater than 3 and more preferably no greater than 2 at a wavelength of 370 nm and a light transmittance of at least 70 and preferably at least 75 at a wavelength of 400 nm. If the light transmittance at a wavelength of 370 nm is greater than 3 the ultraviolet blocking effect will be insufficient resulting in reduced photogenerating efficiency with time after fabrication of the dye sensitized solar cell. If the light transmittance at a wavelength of 400 nm is less than 70 the amount of visible light contributing to photogeneration will be reduced thereby leading to unsatisfactory photogenerating efficiency.

The haze of the polyester film of the invention is preferably no greater than 1.5 more preferably no greater than 1.0 and even more preferably no greater than 0.5 for more efficient photogeneration.

The polyester film of the invention has an absolute value of preferably no greater than 0.8 more preferably no greater than 0.5 and even more preferably no greater than 0.3 for the difference in the heat shrinkage rates in the lengthwise direction and widthwise direction of the film upon treatment for 10 minutes at 200 C. If the absolute value of the difference in heat shrinkage rates is greater than 0.8 cohesion between the transparent conductive layer of the laminated film and the porous semiconductor thereover will be impaired making it difficult to achieve adequate photogenerating performance when fabricating a dye sensitized solar cell.

The polyester film of the invention has a heat shrinkage of preferably 0 0.5 and more preferably 0 0.3 in the lengthwise direction of the film upon treatment for 10 minutes at 200 C. If the heat shrinkage in the lengthwise direction exceeds 0.5 cohesion between the polyester film and transparent conductive layer of the laminated film will be reduced while cohesion between the transparent conductive layer and the porous semiconductor layer thereover will also be reduced.

The three dimensional center line average roughness of the polyester film of the invention is preferably 0.0001 0.02 m more preferably 0.0001 0.015 m and most preferably 0.0001 0.010 m on both sides. Also the three dimensional center line average roughness is preferably 0.0001 0.005 m and more preferably 0.0005 0.004 m on at least one side. The thickness of the polyester film is preferably 10 500 m more preferably 20 400 m and even more preferably 50 300 m. This range is preferred to facilitate working of the transparent conductive layer.

The polyester film having the properties described above may be produced by the following process for example. Hereunder glass transition temperature is abbreviated as Tg .

The polyester film of the invention may be obtained by melt extruding the polyester into a film cooling it to solidification on a casting drum to produce an unstretched film stretching the unstretched film one or more times in the lengthwise direction at Tg Tg 60 C. to a total factor of 3 6 and then stretching it in the widthwise direction at Tg Tg 60 C. to a factor of 3 5 if necessary with heat treatment at 180 255 C. for 1 60 seconds.

In order to adequately reduce the difference in heat shrinkage rates in the lengthwise and widthwise directions of the polyester film as well as the heat shrinkage in the lengthwise direction the film may be contracted in the lengthwise direction in the heat treatment step or it may be subjected to relaxation heat treatment in a suspended state. The method used for contraction in the lengthwise direction in the heat treatment step may be the method described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication HEI No. 57 57628. The method of relaxation heat treatment of the film in a suspended state may be the method described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication HEI No. 1 275031.

The transparent conductive layer used may be a conductive metal oxide such as for example fluorine doped tin oxide or indium tin oxide ITO . There may also be used a metal thin film made of for example platinum gold silver copper or aluminum. A carbonaceous material may also be used.

The transparent conductive layer used may be of a single type or two or more different ones may be laminated for use as a composite. Indium tin oxide ITO is preferred among these materials because of its high light transmittance and low resistance.

The surface tension of the transparent conductive layer is 40 mN m or greater and preferably 65 mN m or greater. If the surface tension is less than 40 mN m cohesion between the transparent conductive layer and porous semiconductor will be inferior. The surface tension is preferably 65 mN m or greater for easier formation of the porous semiconductor layer by coating of an aqueous coating solution. The practical upper limit for the surface tension of the transparent conductive layer is about 75 mN m in order to facilitate coating of a completely aqueous coating agent.

The range for the surface resistance of the transparent conductive layer is preferably no greater than 100 and more preferably no greater than 40 . It is preferably not greater than 100 because the internal resistance of the cell will be excessively increased and the photogenerating efficiency will be reduced.

The thickness of the transparent conductive layer is preferably 100 500 nm. It is preferably not less than 100 nm because it will not be possible to adequately reduce the surface resistance value and preferably not greater than 500 nm because the light transmittance will be reduced and the transparent conductive layer will be prone to cracking.

The surface tension may be determined by activation of the surface of the transparent conductive layer by any of the methods described below. Specifically there may be mentioned a method of activation by treatment with an acidic or alkaline solution a method of activation by irradiation with ultraviolet rays or an electron beam and a method of activation by corona treatment or plasma treatment. Of these methods of activation of the surface by corona treatment or plasma treatment and especially methods of activation of the surface by plasma treatment are preferred to obtain high surface tension. When the transparent conductive layer surface is activated by plasma treatment it may be conducted under the following conditions for example. Specifically a normal pressure plasma surface treatment apparatus may be used for plasma treatment of the transparent conductive layer surface at 0.1 10 m min under a 1 200 L min stream of an inert gas or a mixture of an inert gas and oxygen. Nitrogen for example may be used as the inert gas.

In the laminated film of the invention a readily adhesive layer is preferably provided between the polyester film and the transparent conductive layer in order to improve the cohesion between the polyester film and the transparent conductive layer formed thereover. The thickness of the readily adhesive layer is preferably 10 200 nm and more preferably 20 150 nm. If the thickness of the readily adhesive layer is less than 10 nm the effect of improved cohesion will be minimal and if it is greater than 200 nm the readily adhesive layer will be prone to clumping and breakage resulting in reduced cohesion.

The readily adhesive layer is preferably formed by coating in the polyester film production step. The coating is preferably carried out on the polyester film prior to completion of oriented crystallization. The expression polyester film prior to completion of oriented crystallization includes unstretched films uniaxial stretched films that have been oriented in either the machine or transverse direction of an unstretched film and biaxial stretched films that have been stretched to a low factor in both the machine and transverse directions biaxial stretched films prior to completion of oriented crystallization by final re stretching in the machine or transverse direction . Preferably an aqueous coating solution having the composition of the readily adhesive layer is coated onto an unstretched film or a uniaxial stretched film and this is subjected to longitudinal and or transverse stretching to obtain a biaxial stretched film which is then heat set.

The readily adhesive layer is preferably composed of a material that exhibits excellent adhesion for both the polyester film and the transparent conductive layer. Specific examples of such materials include polyester resins acrylic resins urethane acrylic resins silicon acrylic resins melamine resins and polysiloxane resins. These resins may be used alone or two or more may be used in admixture.

In the laminated film of the invention a hard coat layer is preferably provided between the readily adhesive layer and the transparent conductive layer in order to improve the cohesion and especially the durability of cohesion between the polyester film and the transparent conductive layer formed thereover. The hard coat layer may be formed by coating and hardening a hard coat structural material on the readily adhesive layer formed polyester film. As hard coat layer structural materials there may be used ones which exhibit adhesion with both the readily adhesive layer and the transparent conductive layer. For example a mixture of a resin and inorganic particles may be used. Examples of resins that may be used include acrylic resins urethane resins silicon resins UV curing resins and epoxy resins. Examples of inorganic particles that may be used include alumina silica and mica. The thickness of the hard coat layer is preferably 0.01 20 m and more preferably 1 10 m.

The laminated film of the invention preferably comprises an anti reflection layer on the side opposite the transparent conductive layer in order to increase the light transmittance and enhance the photogenerating efficiency.

The anti reflection layer may be provided by forming a single layer or a multilayer of a material with a different refractive index than the refractive index of the polyester film. In the case of a single anti reflection layer a material having a smaller refractive index than the base film may be used. In the case of multiple anti reflection layers preferably a material having a larger refractive index N than the polyester film is selected as the material for the layer adjacent to the laminated film and a material having a refractive index N smaller than N is selected as the material for the layer laminated thereover.

The material composing the anti reflection layer may be an organic material and or inorganic material satisfying the aforementioned relationship for the refractive index. As examples there may be mentioned dielectric materials such as CaF MgF NaAlF SiO ThF ZrO NdO SnO TiO CeO2 ZnS and InO.

The method for laminating the anti reflection layer may be for example a dry coating method or wet coating method. As examples of dry coating methods there may be mentioned vacuum vapor deposition sputtering CVD and ion plating. As examples of wet coating methods there may be mentioned gravure reverse and die coating.

Before laminating the anti reflection layer the side on which the anti reflection layer is to be formed may be subjected to pretreatment such as corona discharge treatment plasma treatment sputter etching treatment electron beam irradiation treatment ultraviolet irradiation treatment primer treatment or ready adhesion treatment.

The electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell of the invention comprises a laminated film for the dye sensitized solar cell and a porous semiconductor layer formed on its transparent conductive layer. The porous semiconductor layer is formed by baking a metal oxide on the transparent conductive layer at 170 250 C. The metal oxide forms the porous semiconductor layer as an n type semiconductor. A material comprising a composite of multiple oxides may also be used.

According to the invention the porous semiconductor layer is formed by baking the metal oxide on the transparent conductive layer formed on one side of the polyester film at 170 250 C. The polyester film used is preferably a polyester film having an absolute value of no greater than 0.8 for the difference in the heat shrinkage rates in the lengthwise direction and widthwise direction of the film upon treatment for 10 minutes at 200 C.

The metal oxide is preferably at least one type of metal oxide selected from the group consisting of titanium oxide TiO zinc oxide ZnO and tin oxide SnO .

The baking is carried out for reinforcement of electrical contact between the semiconductor fine particles and improved adhesion with the transparent conductive layer. The baking conditions are preferably 170 250 C. for 1 120 minutes more preferably 180 230 C. for 3 90 minutes and most preferably 190 200 C. for 5 60 minutes. The baking can minimize increase in resistance of the porous semiconductor layer while preventing heat induced deformation of the polyester film. If the baking temperature is below 170 C. it will not be possible to adequately reinforce electrical contact between the semiconductor fine particles and the photogenerating efficiency of the fabricated dye sensitized solar cell will be reduced. If the temperature is above 250 C. heat induced deformation of the polyester film will be significant and cohesion between the transparent conductive layer and porous semiconductor layer will be reduced.

The porous semiconductor layer has a structure with sintered or fused semiconductor ultrafine particles. The particle sizes of the ultrafine particles are preferably 5 100 nm and more preferably 5 50 nm as the mean primary particle size.

The semiconductor ultrafine particles may also be a mixture of two or more types of fine particles with different particle size distributions. Semiconductor particles with large particle sizes may also be combined therewith in order to scatter incident rays and improve the optical trapping efficiency. Such semiconductor particles may have a mean primary particle size of about 300 nm for example.

Semiconductor ultrafine particles for the porous semiconductor layer may be prepared by a publicly known sol gel method or gas phase thermal decomposition method see Dye Sensitized Solar Cells Fundamentals and Applications Yanagida S. ed. 2001 Gijutsu Kyoiku Publications or Thin Film Coating Technology by Sol Gel Methods 1995 Gijutsu Kyoiku Publications .

For preparation of a dispersion of the semiconductor ultrafine particles there may be employed a method of depositing the fine particles from a solvent as the co precipitation product of a chemical reaction or a method using ultrasonic irradiation or mechanical crushing for pulverization into ultrafine particles and dispersion.

The porous semiconductor layer is preferably formed by a coating method. Specifically a dispersion of the semiconductor ultrafine particles is preferably coated onto the transparent semiconductor layer of the laminated film and heated to dryness for anchoring of a porous semiconductor layer on the transparent conductive layer.

The dispersion medium used may be water or an organic solvent. For the dispersion a small amount of a polymer such as polyethylene glycol hydroxyethyl cellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose a surfactant or an acid or chelating agent may be added if necessary.

The dispersion of the semiconductor ultrafine particles is coated for a semiconductor fine particle amount of preferably 0.5 20 g mand more preferably 5 10 g m with respect to 1 mof the support. The coating may be accomplished by any desired method that has hitherto been commonly employed for coating. For example a roller method dip method air knife method blade method wire bar method slide hopper method extrusion method or curtain method may be used. There may also be employed a spin method or spray method using a general purpose machine. Coating may also be accomplished by any of the three major known printing methods i.e. relief printing offset printing and gravure printing as well as wet printing such as intaglio printing rubber plate printing or screen printing. The most suitable film forming method may be selected as appropriate for the solution viscosity and wet thickness.

The porous semiconductor layer is formed to a thickness of preferably 1 30 m more preferably 2 10 m and even more preferably 2 6 m. This range can yield a high degree of transparency.

The porous semiconductor layer may be subjected to irradiation with light that is strongly absorbed by the ultrafine particles such as ultraviolet light or to microwave irradiation to reinforce physical bonding between the ultrafine particles.

A primary coating layer may also be formed on the transparent conductive layer beforehand in order to prevent electrical shorting of the porous semiconductor bearing transparent conductive layer with the counter electrode. In this case the thickness of the primary coating layer is preferably 5 1000 nm and more preferably 10 500 nm. The material for the primary coating layer is preferably TiO SnO ZnO or NbO and is most preferably TiO. The primary coating layer may be formed by the spray pyrolysis method or sputtering method as described in Electrochim Acta 40 643 652 1995 for example.

A publicly known process for production of dye sensitized solar cells may be employed for fabrication of the dye sensitized solar cell using the electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell according to the invention. The following is an example of a process that may be employed.

A dye is adsorbed onto the porous semiconductor layer of the electrode of the invention. Specifically a dye having the property of absorbing light in the visible light region or infrared light region such as an organometallic complex dye e.g. ruthenium piperidine complex ruthenium complex or a cyanine based dye coumarin based dye xanthene based dye or porphyrin based dye is dissolved in a solvent such as an alcohol or toluene to form a dye solution and the porous semiconductor layer is dipped into the dye solution or the dye solution is sprayed or applied onto the porous semiconductor layer.

A thin platinum layer is formed on the transparent conductive layer side of the laminated film by sputtering to form the counter electrode.

The aforementioned electrode A and electrode B are stacked together separated by an inserted frame spacer 20 m thickness made of a thermocompression bonding polyethylene film and the spacer section is heated to 120 C. for contact bonding. The edges of the obtained structure are sealed with an epoxy resin adhesive.

An aqueous electrolyte solution containing lithium iodide and iodine 3 2 molar ratio and 3 wt nylon beads with a mean particle size of 20 m as spacers is injected through a small hole for electrolyte solution injection which is preformed at the corner of the structure. The interior is then sufficiently deaired and finally the small hole is sealed with an epoxy resin adhesive.

The laminated film for a dye sensitized solar cell and the electrode for a dye sensitized solar cell according to the invention may be used to produce a dye sensitized solar cell by the aforementioned process explained as an example.

The ethylene glycol solution of trimethyl phosphate was prepared beforehand by heating trimethyl phosphate in ethylene glycol at 135 C. for 5 hours under 0.11 0.16 MPa pressurization. Upon transfer to a polymerization reactor the temperature was raised to 290 C. for polycondensation under a high vacuum of no greater than 27 Pa. This yielded a substantially particle free polyethylene 2 6 naphthalene dicarboxylate polymer intrinsic viscosity 0.63 dl g .

The polyethylene 2 6 naphthalene dicarboxylate polymer was dried for 6 hours at 170 C. in pellet form and supplied to an extruder hopper and then melted at a melting temperature of 305 C. filtered with a stainless steel wire filter with a 17 m mean pore size passed through a 3 mm slit die extruded onto a rotary cooling drum with a surface temperature of 60 C. and cooled to obtain an unstretched film. The unstretched film was preheated at 120 C. and then heated between a low speed roll and a high speed roll using an IR heater at 850 C. situated 15 mm above and stretched to a factor of 3.2 in the machine direction to obtain a longitudinally stretched film. One side of the longitudinally stretched film was coated with the previously prepared coating agent A using a roll coater to form a readily adhesive layer. The coating amount of coating agent A was adjusted for a post drying thickness of 0.2 m for the readily adhesive layer. The film was fed to a tenter and stretched to a factor of 3.4 in the transverse direction at 140 C. and then heat set at 244 C. for 5 seconds to obtain a biaxial stretched film with a readily adhesive layer.
