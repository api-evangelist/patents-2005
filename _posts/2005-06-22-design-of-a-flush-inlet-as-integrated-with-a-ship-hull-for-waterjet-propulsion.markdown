title: Design of a flush inlet as integrated with a ship hull for waterjet propulsion
abstract: The present invention's methodology for designing a fluid propulsion intake configuration of a marine vessel considers the integral geometry of the inlet together with a portion of the hull, with respect to which the inlet's entrance opening is flush. The inventive methodology typically includes definition of an inlet reference line (an “axial” description, straight and/or curved, of the inlet), cross-planes (each of which perpendicularly intersects the inlet reference line), a footprint (a planar outline of the inlet's entrance opening), an inlet shaping line (a projection of the footprint onto the hull portion), inlet flow lines (angularly spaced about the circumference of the inlet shaping line, each connecting the cross-planes), two fairing reference curves (one at the inlet's entrance opening and the other on the hull portion, thereby demarcating a fairing therebetween that is consistent with the inlet flow lines), and a lip nose (at the inlet's entrance opening).

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention relates to waterjet propulsion of a marine vessel more particularly to methodologies for designing in furtherance of waterjet propulsion of a marine vessel a configuration including a flush inlet and a portion of a marine hull.

The design of a flush inlet for a ship with jet propulsion has traditionally been approached in an ad hoc fashion lacking analytical procedures that relate geometric parameters to the design predictions. In particular these conventional methodologies fail to take into consideration the influence of the ship hull on the flush inlet performance and vice versa.

The inlet performance is critical to the success of a waterjet propulsion system. There are major effects associated with inlet hull interactions. First the inlet in conjunction with the hull constitutes an important hydrodynamic interaction problem that can greatly affect the drag characteristics of the ship. The drag can either be reduced or augmented relative to the hull without inlet. The inlet flow can also affect the trim of the ship and subsequently the drag. The location of the inlet on the ship hull is an important consideration for the drag problem.

The inlet also changes the hull flow characteristics in the vicinity of the inlet. The flow inside the inlet can be subject to adverse pressure gradient and flow separation can be prominent if no systematic method is available to relate flow characteristics to geometric parameters. The stagnation flow near the lip region of the inlet is critical for good cavitation performance.

In addition the inlet geometry has a significant effect on pump performance. The proper shaping of the inlet is important to have minimum dynamic head losses in the flow passage due both to turning and to frictional losses at the wall. The flow in front of the pump face needs to be as uniform as possible to minimize unsteady flow behavior of the pump. The interactions between the inlet and hull must be favorable to propulsion without inducing flow separation and or cavitation.

In view of the foregoing it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for designing in integrative fashion a combination associated with waterjet propulsion of a marine vessel said combination including a flush inlet and a marine hull or portion thereof.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide such a method that promotes the powering efficiency of a waterjet propelled marine vessel.

The present invention represents a synergistic methodology for integratively designing a flush inlet together with a vehicular hull. The present invention is usually practiced in association with a marine hull such as a hull in the nature of a monohull e.g. for a surface ship or a hull in the nature of a body of revolution e.g. for a submersible . Inventive practice is possible with respect to vehicular hulls of diverse shapes and dimensions. Typical inventive practice serves to further the efficiency of the powering performance of a jet propelled ship. The inventive methodology takes into account the effects of the ship hull in the design of a flush inlet for waterjet propulsion.

Featured by the present invention is a geometric specification scheme that allows systematic variations in geometric parameters to affect design performances e.g. powering and cavitation. The inventive design methodology enables design optimization for an inlet hull configuration. The typical inventive design procedure uses a systematic characterization of inlet geometry. The present invention s analytically defined parametric inlet design process can be synergistically applied with respect to any given hull configuration. Inlet shaping can be of any geometric form that the inventive designer practitioner specifies depending upon the hull flow condition.

According to typical inventive embodiments an analytically defined lip geometric specification is inventively provided that can be modified according to the stagnation streamline information during the design iteration process. The present invention gives an explicit characterization of lip geometry that can provide good design practices for pressure recovery and good cavitation performance. Geometric parameters are inventively provided that can be varied to reduce dynamic head losses and minimize the flow non uniformity in front of the pump face. The present invention also facilitates rapid integration of inlet plus hull as one integrated hydrodynamic component.

The inventive methodology is typically practiced for designing the geometry of vehicular structure relating to fluid intake for fluid propulsion. In most applications the present invention pertains to a waterjet propelled marine vessel that includes a flush water inlet. A typical inventive method comprises a defining a global configuration including a fluid inlet and a hull portion b defining a surface of the fluid inlet c defining a fairing between the hull portion and the fluid inlet at the fluid entrance end and d defining a lip nose. The fluid inlet has a fluid entrance end and a fluid exit end. The fluid inlet is integrated flush with the hull portion at the fluid entrance end. The defining of a global configuration includes defining an inlet reference line and defining at least three cross planes. Each cross plane intersects the inlet reference line and is normal to the inlet reference line. A first cross plane is located at the fluid entrance end. A second cross plane is located at the fluid exit end. The inlet reference line extends between the centroid of the first cross plane and the centroid of the second cross plane. The inlet reference line intersects the centroid of each cross plane other than the first cross plane and the second cross plane. The defining of a surface includes defining a footprint defining an inlet shaping line and defining at least three inlet flow lines. The footprint represents a closed planar outline of the fluid inlet at the fluid entrance end of the fluid inlet. The inlet shaping line represents a projection of the footprint onto the hull portion. Each inlet flow line connects the cross planes. The inlet flow lines are spaced at different angular positions around the circumference of the inlet shaping line. The defining of the inlet flow lines includes using with respect to each inlet flow line a fifth order Bezier cross link curve to connect the cross planes at the corresponding angular position. The defining of a fairing includes defining two closed fairing reference curves. A first closed fairing reference curve is on the fluid inlet at the fluid entrance end and along the inlet flow lines. A second closed fairing reference curve is on the hull portion. The fairing extends between the two closed fairing reference curves. The footprint includes a lip section and a ramp section. The lip section is on the leading edge side of the footprint relative to the hull. The ramp section is on the trailing edge side of the footprint relative to the hull. The defining of a lip nose includes defining a nose reference line for the footprint defining a lip outline projection defining an elliptical nose and blending the elliptical nose into the hull portion and a lip nose cutting plane. The lip outline projection represents a projection of the lip section onto the lip cutting plane. The elliptical nose is characterized by a partial elliptical shape the partial elliptical shape is blended into the lip outline projection and the major elliptical axis of the partial elliptical shape coincides with the nose reference line. Some inventive embodiments include the additional step of actually making e.g. constructing or fabricating the vehicular structure so as to include the fluid inlet which can include the lip nose the hull portion and the fairing.

The present invention is unique in that it allows for an integrated design of a flush inlet for marine jet propulsion on any given hull configuration. The geometric provisions and specifications presented hereinbelow by way of example are instructive as to the present invention s physically based parametric geometric modeling method for flush inlet design. The present invention s inlet design methodology as typically embodied is useful as a kind of modeling tool. When used in conjunction with any validated physics based simulation tool e.g. Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Solvers or RANS the present invention s inlet design methodology affords a robust physics based inlet design capability and yields better inlet designs than do the conventional ad hoc inlet design methodologies.

The present invention has several novel features including global definition of the flush inlet configuration an inlet surface generation scheme a projection scheme a fairing scheme and a lip nose definition. According to the present invention s global definition of the flush inlet configuration an arbitrary inlet reference line an axis that generally describes the inlet is defined and a stacking scheme is devised that involves definitions of cross planes along and normal to the inlet reference line. The present invention s scheme for generating an inlet surface including an inside surface involves generation of inlet flow lines around the circumference of the inlet shaping line. The present invention s projection scheme projects the inlet footprint on a planar surface onto the hull surface in a controlled manner by using either uniform or non uniform projection methods. The present invention s fairing scheme blends the inlet flow lines with the hull lines along specified directions. The present invention s lip nose definition provides analytical nose geometric definition.

Other objects advantages and features of this invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Reference is now made to and which depict a typical integrated inlet hull design in accordance with the present invention. and illustrate a flush inlet in combination with a centralized portion of a marine hull . According to typical inventive embodiments flush inlet is located on or in the vicinity of the bottom of the hull . As shown by way of example in and marine hull is for a submersible vehicle and is thus conceived to represent a body of revolution . Flush inlet includes an inlet fluid entrance opening an outlet fluid exit opening and a flow passage . In the vicinity of the fore and aft areas respectively of fluid entrance opening are the ramp face region and the lip region .

Fluid entrance opening is flush generally even with hull bottom . Fluid exit opening is connected to the casing of a pump represented diagrammatically in . As shown in the bow and stern of marine hull not shown are conceived to be at the lefthand and righthand sides respectively and marine hull is moving from right to left. During navigation by marine hull of a body of water water is constantly taken into flush inlet at inlet opening and conducted by flush inlet to pump which pressurizes the water so as to facilitate waterjet propulsion of hull .

The present invention as typically embodied provides a geometric method for designing e.g. modeling a flush inlet integrated with a hull for marine applications. The inventive design method typically requires the following specifications i the location relative to hull of the reference line reference axis a of flush inlet ii the inclination angle and geometric definition of the inlet reference line a ii the shape of hull iv the planar outline of the flush inlet shape and its projection v the area scheduling in the flow passage of flush inlet vi fairing control by angular and axial bias vii the fairing of flush inlet with hull at the ramp face of flush inlet viii the lip geometry specifications and fairing to hull .

With reference to the flush inlet geometry can be characterized by defining for flush inlet an inlet reference line IRL a. Inlet reference line a represents an axial or axis like line of reference for flush inlet . Inlet reference line a can be a straight linear line or a curved line or a curvilinear line having at least one straight portion and at least one curved portion . An inlet reference line a can be curved in two dimensional plane or in three dimensional space. More generally the word line is used herein in the geometrically nonrestrictive sense of allowing for the possibility of a line of any shape e.g. straight curved or some combination thereof and direction. As shown in a side view of a typical inventive flush inlet inlet reference line a is geometrical curved line A B. Inlet reference line a terminates at a point B that is next to pump and originates at a point A that is approximately even or coplanar with the surface of hull bottom .

Selection of the origin of the inlet reference line a is important as it has a major impact on the interaction between flush inlet and hull . As shown in inlet reference line a is inclined to hull . Reference line a must be defined by a geometric curve that originates at the hull bottom surface e.g. at a point A as shown in and that terminates at a location e.g. at a point B as shown in where the flush inlet will be connected to the pump casing.

Still referring to and also referring to plural cross planes that are normal to reference line a can be established along reference line a. Cross planes and are shown in . The first cross plane viz. cross plane defines the shape of inlet opening . The last cross plane viz. cross plane defines the shape of outlet opening which matches the forward face of the pump casing. The inventive designer can select the areas and shapes of the cross planes as a function of position along the inlet reference line a. The decision on the area distribution along reference line a is mainly dictated by the flow diffusion or acceleration requirement through the inlet flow passage .

Generally each reference line a passes through the centroid c of the corresponding cross plane . Cross planes are analytically defined closed curves. Each cross plane can be divided in angular segments by revolving around the centroid c of the closed curve. Five cross planes that describe the inlet shape can be established at this stage. The circumference of the closed cross planes can be equally divided into a number of segments uniform distribution . The same number of divisions is applied to all cross planes . The cross planes along the reference line a are connected via connecting each point on the circumference of the cross planes as the function of angular position. The number of the linking curves that connect the cross planes is equal to the number of angular divisions of cross planes . The present invention typically uses a fifth order Bezier cross link curve to connect the cross planes at each angular position. The Bezier cross link curves that connect the cross planes are defined as the inlet flow lines IFL which are shown in for a typical inlet configuration. With reference to line A B represents a typical inlet flow line on the ramp face . Line D E C represents a typical inlet flow line at the lip region . Other inlet flow lines are shown distributed along the inlet shaping line ISL .

The hull surface definition in the vicinity of the inlet is usually required in the present invention s inlet modeling. The planar outline of the inlet shape is defined in a geometric plane such that the normal to the plane is the same as the normal to the hull at the origin A of the reference line a. The inlet outline on the planar surface is referred to herein as the footprint of the inlet shape. A typical outline of the footprint of the inlet shape is depicted in . In general the footprint can be defined along the hull body coordinate system with the major line along the hull longitudinal direction and the minor line along the hull transverse direction. The forward portion of the footprint outlines the ramp portion of the inlet shape. Ramp line is shown in as curve D A B i.e. the curved line segment having extreme points D and B and passing through point A therebetween . The rearward portion of the footprint outlines the lip portion of the inlet shape. Lip line is shown in as curve B C D i.e. the curved line segment having extreme points D and B and passing through point C therebetween .

The footprint shown in as closed curve A B is then projected onto the surface of the hull . Different projection schemes can be invoked during the inventive design process. Shown in is a typical projected footprint on a hull surface of a body of revolution . The projected footprint shown as closed curve A B is referred to herein as the inlet shaping line ISL . A uniform projection scheme involves projection of the footprint to the hull at a specified angle relative to the planar surface. The projection angle depends on the topology of the body shape at the location of the inlet . A non uniform variable projection scheme allows variable angles of projection of the inlet shaping line to the hull surface. The variable scheme provides additional control in inlet shaping on the hull surface.

ISL the projection of footprint the planar inlet outline curve on the hull automatically creates discontinuity across the hull surface and the inlet surface. A fairing scheme is needed to ensure curvature continuity from the hull to the inlet . The fairing scheme involves defining two reference curves as the blending curves which will provide the location along the inlet flow lines and the location on the hull where the fairing between the hull and the inlet should occur. A demonstration of blending curves is shown in for a typical inlet hull configuration. Blending curve is on the hull surface. Blending curve is on the hull inlet surface. Blending curves and serve to delimit the fairing. The fairing can be conducted along each IFL and the points on the hull by a cubic spline that will preserve slopes and curvatures continuity on the boundaries. Defining an axial and an angular bias can further control the general topology of the inlet hull intersection. An axial bias is an axial displacement of the origin of inlet reference line a along the major line of the footprint . An angular bias is defined as a non uniform distribution of points along the ISL .

The lip portion of the inlet requires special attention and a robust definition of the inlet lip shape is usually critical to the success of the present invention s inlet design. The lip can be characterized by defining a cutting plane through the lip region of the inlet . In general a cutting plane is a planar surface that can be specified to be aligned with the stagnated streamline at the lip . The outline of the lip shape on the cutting plane can be modified if there is a need to improve the inlet flow at the lip region to prevent flow separation or improve cavitation performance. A nose reference line such as shown in as curve O O C can be defined by identifying the leading edge radius and the leading edge location of the lip .

An analytically defined leading edge shape can be implemented along the portion of the inlet shaping line where the lip is located. Lip outline projection the inlet lip line geometry as projected onto the lip cutting plane is shown in as curve A O B. According to typical embodiments of the present invention an elliptical nose with an exponential weighted function from the leading edge is prescribed. The major axis of the weighted elliptical function is along the nose reference line . The original elliptical nose is blended into the hull line and lip nose cutting plane by matching the locations slopes and or curvatures. The new nose the final lip nose geometry as transformed back to the IFL coordinates is shown in as curve A O B . 

In accordance with the multifarious embodiments of the present invention inventive modeling approaches other than those described hereinabove can be inventively implemented. For instance depending on the inventive embodiment varous spline algorithms can be used in modeling the inlet flow lines and or the inlet shaping lines.

Reference now being made to according to typical inventive embodiments a two level or two phase approach is taken that includes i a preliminary design and analysis procedure and ii a detailed performance analysis using computational fluid dynamics CFD . A schematic of a typical inventive two phase design process is depicted in FIG. . The preliminary design and analysis phase includes global shaping and preliminary design panel method . The performance analysis phase includes detailed geometric specifications detailed hydrodynamics analysis and performance evaluations design and off design conditions . Each of these phase components lends itself to processing using a computer that includes a processor and a storage device along with peripherals such as interface equipment e.g. keyboard and mouse a display unit and a printer. The software tools for the preliminary design and analysis phase include an enhanced inlet geometry code and a potential flow code.

The present invention s preliminary design and analysis provide inlet parametric study based upon the geometric characterizations for flush inlets. The Panel code VSAERO is used to provide comparative design predictions based on potential flow theory in selecting appropriate geometric variations in the parametric study. Sensitivities can be conducted to assess the relative importance of various geometric parameters to inlet flow. Candidates are selected based on the preliminary evaluations for the detailed analysis. The main tool for the detailed analysis is the unstructured UNCLE 3D RANS code. The detailed analysis provides velocity and pressure distributions on the inlet surface and the inlet flow passage. Design parameters of interest e.g. mass flow rates inlet losses and flow distortions at the impeller face can be characterized based on the computed velocities and pressure.

Preliminary design of an inlet includes a global shaping scheme and design by analysis that uses potential flow based panel code VSAERO. With reference to the global shaping scheme requires five major design specifications as follows i the inlet shape which can be any shape of interest ii the transition length iii the inclination angle along the inlet line which is the angle formed between the inlet plane with the attendant reference coordinate system iv the inlet fillet control fairing by using both axial and angular bias as defined hereinabove and v area ratio scheduling between the inlet plane and the exit plane. In the global shaping the parametric study is conducted by varying these five major parameters. In general variations in the inclination angle and the transition length are limited by the physical space available inside the hull where the inlet is located. The inlet shapes need to be determined by considering the geometry of the external hull shape subject to the constraints of inclination angle and transition length. Local fillet controls can be exercised to fine tune the blending of inlet to the hull.

In practicing the present invention there is no exact design theory available at this time to explicitly define inlet shapes based on the given constraints and the specified design objectives. Parametric studies need to be conducted at the preliminary design stage to establish pertinent features that further good inlet design. It is recognized at this time that the design parametric space for inlet design is enormous and that it is necessary to reduce the size of the design space significantly so that the computational task is manageable. In the absence of development in this regard inventive design typically is restricted to the class of oval shapes. An elliptical shape can be considered as a special case of oval shapes with skew factor of one 1 . The determination of oval shape as the primary inlet shape of interest is a subjective judgment based on its topological property when it is blended on a surface of revolution.

In inventive testing the panel code VSAERO was used to analyze the inlet hull configuration. The results of potential flow simulations can only be interpreted on a comparative basis. Typically in inventive practice the flow variable of interest is the static pressure and its gradient information around and inside the inlet region. The primary objective for the preliminary design is thus to identify geometric features that produce the least amount of pressure gradient variations. Design candidates can be selected for detailed evaluations of their performance using RANS solver UNCLE. The RANS simulations provide detailed flow information that can be used to fine tune the inlet geometry for better performance. Major parameters of interest are the thrust mass flow rate and jet velocity ratio at the self propulsion point .

The effectiveness of an inlet design in accordance with the present invention can be evaluated using criteria of desirable characteristics including the following i no flow separation at inlet ii minimizing inlet loss iii shock free entry and iv minimizing the inflow distortion at the pump face. Application of these and other criteria may militate in favor of effecting a re design at least to a limited degree in accordance with the present invention. For instance the fairing at the inlet hull junction including the lip geometry may need to be modified to improve the performance. Major re design may be required if there is excess separation and highly distorted flow at the pump face.
