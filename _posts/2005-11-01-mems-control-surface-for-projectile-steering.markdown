title: MEMS control surface for projectile steering
abstract: A projectile includes a projectile body including a flow surface; the flow surface including at least one control surface formed therein. The controls surface is formed continuous with the flow surface, and a pressure source is connected to at least one control surface. The pressure source delivers a pressure to at least one control surface to cause at least one control surface to bulge away from the flow surface.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for government purposes without the payment of any royalties thereof.

The invention relates in general to devices for steering projectiles and in particular to micro electromechanical systems MEMS type control surfaces for steering projectiles.

Conventional control systems rely on actuators to rotate fins to provide flight path control. These fins protrude far into the flow stream and require actuators that provide sufficient torque to maintain the fins in the desired orientation. MEMS have been demonstrated for flight control on delta wings. Small perturbations in the flow field created by MEMS structures can result in a net macro force with sufficient strength to steer large objects.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 105 904 discloses deployable flow control devices. of that patent show two embodiments in which a sealable flexible element acts as a flow effector. shows the sealable flexible element in the quiescent state while shows it in the deformed state. The sealable flexible element secures to the housing under lip. When plenum is not pressurized the sealable flexible element is in its quiescent state retracted out of the fluid boundary layer on the flow surface and within the housing. When the plenum is pressurized the sealable flexible element changes to its deformed state expanding such that it deploys through aperture into the fluid boundary layer on the flow surface. When the plenum is depressurized the sealable flexible element returns to its quiescent state and retracts out of the fluid boundary layer on the flow surface. show the sealable flexible element attached to the flow surface rather than the housing.

One problem with the device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 105 904 is that the flow effector is a separate piece that must be attached in some manner to the projectile flow surface or skin. At high velocities such as Mach 2 to Mach 10 the temperature of the projectile flow surface increases to several hundred degrees Centigrade which causes weakness at areas where the flow effector is attached to the flow surface. Another problem is using a polymer as the material for the flow effector. At high velocities and temperatures the polymer is too elastic and unstable. Still another problem is that in the embodiment of the flow effector is not flush with the flow surface thereby creating a flow disturbance when the flow effector is in the inactive position. Similarly in the embodiment of the flow effector projects above the flow surface even in the inactive position.

Unexpectedly Applicant has discovered a novel structural arrangement to overcome the above limitations.

The present invention overcomes the problems of the conventional technology by providing a control surface that is formed continuous with the surrounding flow surface. Therefore there is no separate piece that must be attached to the flow surface. Eliminating the separate piece eliminates the possibility that the separate piece may become detached or weakened at high velocities and temperatures. In addition the control surface will be flush with the flow surface in the inactive position thereby eliminating unwanted flow disturbances. Furthermore the inventive control surface is made of the same material as the surrounding flow surface so that its elasticity and high temperature stability is suitable for high velocities and temperatures.

An object of the invention is to guide hypersonic projectiles without adversely affecting the projectile drag coefficient.

Another object of the invention is to provide a control surface that consumes minimal power and volume.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

In accordance with the invention MEMS control surfaces and in an embodiment the control surface is a diaphragm structure are formed continuous with the flow surface of a projectile so as to be intergrated with the flow surface in order to alter the flow field around the projectile. By applying a pressure stimulus to a MEMS diaphragm the changes in the flow field result in changes in drag and lift that can be used to steer the projectile. The invention is particularly useful for projectiles traveling at hypersonic velocities. At hypersonic velocities only a very small protuberance into the flow field is needed to influence the direction of flight. Even deflections as small as 40 m can have a significant effect on the flow field.

The MEMS control surfaces may be located directly on the projectile or on the fins of the projectile. The pressure may be supplied to the control surfaces via an actuator or harnessed from the flow field. The MEMS control surfaces have in essence no moving parts. As result the system will share benefits enjoyed by other solid state systems such as elimination of friction and wear and greater repeatability. In addition MEMS batch fabrication processes generally result in dramatically reduced cost. The invention reduces volume and power requirements. The low profile structures have less drag than conventional systems which results in a longer projectile range and reduced heating.

A thickness of flow surface is for example in a range of about 0.5 to about 7 millimeters. A thickness of the diaphragm is for example in a range of about 10 microns to about 100 microns. The amount of deflection of diaphragm from its rest state in to its deflected state in is for example in a range of about 20 microns to about one millimeter. The shape of diaphragm in the plane of the flow surface may vary. Generally but without limitation the shapes are circles or squares with a principal dimension in a range of about 1 millimeter to about five millimeters which in part facilitate cycling of the control surfaces

Diaphragm is formed of the same piece of material as flow surface . One way of forming diaphragm is by thinning out the underside of the flow surface by etching with for example an acid. The remaining portions of the underside of flow surface would be masked to prevent any unwanted thinning. Flow surface and diaphragm are made of a material that can withstand the extremely high temperatures associated with high velocity Mach 2 Mach 10 flow. Generally the materials are metals including titanium and stainless steel. Nonetheless in an embodiment a ceramic material for example silicon carbide may also be used.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.

Finally any numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations for example by using the term about that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding.
