The subject matter of this patent application relates to computer software architecture and more particularly to the architecture of application software for internal projects.

Enterprise software systems are generally large and complex. Such systems can require many different components distributed across many different hardware platforms possibly in several different geographical locations. Thus the architecture of a large software application i.e. what its components are and how they fit together is an important aspect of its design for a successful implementation.

The invention can be implemented as methods systems and apparatus including computer program products for implementing a software architecture design for a software application implementing an internal projects application useful for planning and executing internal projects and measures including network scheduling resource staffing cost estimation and management time confirmation and progress monitoring. The application is structured as multiple process components interacting with each other through service interfaces and multiple service interface operations each being implemented for a respective process component. The process components include a Costing process component that maintains project cost estimates an Accounting process component that records relevant business transactions a Project Processing process component that structures plans and executes simple short term measures and complex projects and a Time and Labor Management process component that supports the definition of employees planned working times as well as the recording of the actual working times and absences and their evaluation.

The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented to realize one or more of the following advantages. Effective use is made of process components as units of software reuse to provide a design that can be implemented reliably in a cost effective way. Effective use is made of deployment units each of which is deployable on a separate computer hardware platform independent of every other deployment unit to provide a scalable design. Service interfaces of the process components define a pair wise interaction between pairs of process components that are in different deployment units in a scalable way.

Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and in the description below. Further features aspects and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

As shown in the internal projects design includes three deployment units a Financial Accounting deployment unit a Project Management deployment unit and a Human Capital Management deployment unit .

The Financial Accounting deployment unit includes two process components a Costing process component and an Accounting process component . The Costing process component is used for maintaining project cost estimates. The Accounting process component records all relevant business transactions in Financial Accounting.

The Project Management deployment unit includes a Project Processing process component . The Project Processing process component is responsible for structuring planning and executing simple short term measures and complex projects.

The Human Capital Management deployment unit includes a Time and Labor Management process component . The Time and Labor Management process component supports the definition of employees planned working times as well as the recording of the actual working times and absences and their evaluation.

Not explicitly represented in the figures is a foundation layer that contains all fundamental entities that are used in multiple deployment units. These entities can be process components business objects and reuse service components. A reuse service component is a piece of software that is reused in different transactions. A reuse service component is used by its defined interfaces which can be e.g. local APIs Application Programming Interfaces or service interfaces.

In contrast to a deployment unit the foundation layer does not define a limit for application defined transactions. Deployment units communicate directly with entities in the foundation layer which communication is typically not message based. The foundation layer is active in every system instance on which the application is deployed. Business objects in the foundation layer will generally be master data objects. In addition the foundation layer will include some business process objects that are used by multiple deployment units. Master data objects and business process objects that should be specific to a deployment unit are assigned to their respective deployment unit.

A process component of an external system is drawn as a dashed line process component drawn as icon . Such a process component is used to represent the external system in describing interactions with the external system however this should be understood to require no more of the external system that it be able to produce and receive messages as required by the process component that interacts with the external system.

Interactions between process component pairs involving their respective business objects process agents operations interfaces and messages are described as process component interactions which determine the interactions of a pair of process components across a deployment unit boundary i.e. from one deployment unit to another deployment unit. Interactions between process components are indicated in by directed lines arrows . Interactions between process components within a deployment unit need not be described except to note that they exist as these interactions are not constrained by the architectural design and can be implemented in any convenient fashion. Interactions between process components that cross a deployment unit boundary will be illustrated by the figures of this patent application these figures will show the relevant elements associated with potential interaction between two process components but interfaces process agents and business objects that are not relevant to the potential interaction will not be shown.

The architectural design is a specification of a computer software application and elements of the architectural design can be implemented to realize a software application that implements the end to end process mentioned earlier. The elements of the architecture are at times described in this specification as being contained or included in other elements for example a process component is described as being contained in a deployment unit. It should be understood however that such operational inclusion can be realized in a variety of ways and is not limited to a physical inclusion of the entirety of one element in another.

The architectural elements include the business object. A business object is a representation of a type of a uniquely identifiable business entity an object instance described by a structural model. Processes operate on business objects.

A business object represents a specific view on some well defined business content. A business object represents content which a typical business user would expect and understand with little explanation. Business objects are further categorized as business process objects and master data objects. A master data object is an object that encapsulates master data i.e. data that is valid for a period of time . A business process object which is the kind of business object generally found in a process component is an object that encapsulates transactional data i.e. data that is valid for a point in time . The term business object will be used generically to refer to a business process object and a master data object unless the context requires otherwise. Properly implemented business objects are implemented free of redundancies.

The architectural elements also include the process component. A process component is a software package that realizes a business process and generally exposes its functionality as services. The functionality contains business transactions. A process component contains one or more semantically related business objects. Any business object belongs to no more than one process component.

Process components are modular and context independent. That they are context independent means that a process component is not specific to any specific application and is reusable. The process component is the smallest most granular element of reuse in the architecture.

The architectural elements also include the operation. An operation belongs to exactly one process component. A process component generally has multiple operations. Operations can be synchronous or asynchronous corresponding to synchronous or asynchronous process agents which will be described below. An operation is the smallest separately callable function described by a set of data types used as input output and fault parameters serving as a signature.

The architectural elements also include the service interface referred to simply as the interface. An interface is a named group of operations. Each operation belongs to exactly one interface. An interface belongs to exactly one process component. A process component might contain multiple interfaces. In one implementation an interface contains only inbound or outbound operations but not a mixture of both. One interface can contain both synchronous and asynchronous operations. All operations of the same type either inbound or outbound which belong to the same message choreography will belong to the same interface. Thus generally all outbound operations to the same other process component are in one interface.

The architectural elements also include the message. Operations transmit and receive messages. Any convenient messaging infrastructure can be used. A message is information conveyed from one process component instance to another with the expectation that activity will ensue. An operation can use multiple message types for inbound outbound or error messages. When two process components are in different deployment units invocation of an operation of one process component by the other process component is accomplished by an operation on the other process component sending a message to the first process component.

The architectural elements also include the process agent. Process agents do business processing that involves the sending or receiving of messages. Each operation will generally have at least one associated process agent. A process agent can be associated with one or more operations. Process agents can be either inbound or outbound and either synchronous or asynchronous.

Asynchronous outbound process agents are called after a business object changes e.g. after a create update or delete of a business object instance.

An output process agent will generally perform some processing of the data of the business object instance whose change triggered the event. An outbound agent triggers subsequent business process steps by sending messages using well defined outbound services to another process component which generally will be in another deployment unit or to an external system. An outbound process agent is linked to the one business object that triggers the agent but it is sent not to another business object but rather to another process component. Thus the outbound process agent can be implemented without knowledge of the exact business object design of the recipient process component.

Inbound process agents are called after a message has been received. Inbound process agents are used for the inbound part of a message based communication. An inbound process agent starts the execution of the business process step requested in a message by creating or updating one or multiple business object instances. An inbound process agent is not the agent of a business object but of its process component. An inbound process agent can act on multiple business objects in a process component.

Synchronous agents are used when a process component requires a more or less immediate response from another process component and is waiting for that response to continue its work.

Operations and process components are described in this specification in terms of process agents. However in alternative implementations process components and operations can be implemented without use of agents using other conventional techniques to perform the functions described in this specification.

The architectural elements also include the deployment unit. A deployment unit includes one or more process components that are deployed together on a single computer system platform. Conversely separate deployment units can be deployed on separate physical computing systems. For this reason a deployment unit boundary defines the limits of an application defined transaction i.e. a set of actions that have the ACID properties of atomicity consistency isolation and durability. To make use of database manager facilities the architecture requires that all operations of such a transaction be performed on one physical database as a consequence the processes of such a transaction must be performed by the process components of one instance of one deployment unit.

The process components of one deployment unit interact with those of another deployment unit using messages passed through one or more data communication networks or other suitable communication channels. Thus a deployment unit deployed on a platform belonging one business can interact with a deployment unit software entity deployed on a separate platform belonging to a different and unrelated business allowing for business to business communication. More than one instance of a given deployment unit can execute at the same time on the same computing system or on separate physical computing systems. This arrangement allows the functionality offered by a deployment unit to be scaled to meet demand by creating as many instances as needed.

Since interaction between deployment units is through service operations a deployment unit can be replaced by other another deployment unit as long as the new deployment unit supports the operations depended upon by other deployment units. Thus while deployment units can depend on the external interfaces of process components in other deployment units deployment units are not dependent on process component interaction within other deployment units. Similarly process components that interact with other process components or external systems only through messages e.g. as sent and received by operations can also be replaced as long as the replacement supports the operations of the original.

The Project business object represents a business operation that is characterized by a unique set of conditions on which it is based. For example the conditions may be the targets to be met the organizational structure or the financial personal and time constraints on the project. It is structured by project elements such as phases and tasks.

The Accounting process component contains an Accounting Notification business object an Accounting View on Project business object a Maintain Accounting View on Project and Ledger Account inbound process agent and a Project Accounting In interface .

The Accounting Notification business object represents a common input channel for all kinds of operational business transactions into Financial Accounting that is called by operational components in order to record the business transactions in Financial Accounting. The Accounting View on Project business object represents a project structure in a Financials application. This project structure consists only of elements and their characteristics with respect to Financials.

The Project business object initiates project notification within the Project Processing process component . The Project business object first sends a request to the Notify of Project to Accounting outbound process agent . For example the request may be to notify accounting that a project element has been created changed deleted or moved. Here the outbound process agent invokes a Notify of Project operation provided by the Project Accounting Out interface . Upon completion the Notify of Project operation transmits a Project. Accounting Notification message requesting the entry in accounting to be made. For example the message may indicate that relevant changes in project elements are complete.

The Project Accounting Notification message initiates accounting notification within the Accounting process component . The Project Accounting Notification message is received by a Maintain Subledger Account operation provided by the Project Accounting In interface . Here the operation sends a request to the Maintain Accounting View on Project and Ledger Account inbound process agent to update the Accounting Notification business object and show that a project has been created changed or deleted.

The Project Processing process component contains two business objects five outbound process agents and one interface. The business objects include a Project business object and a Project Snapshot business object . The outbound process agents include a Sync Request Project Cost Estimate Simulation from Project to Costing outbound process agent a Request Project Cost Estimate from Project Snapshot to Costing outbound process agent a Sync Query Project Cost Estimate from Project to Costing outbound process agent a Request Project Cost Estimate from Project Snapshot to Costing outbound process agent and a Sync Query Project Cost Estimate from Project Snapshot to Costing outbound process agent . The interface is a Project Costing Out interface .

The Project business object represents a business operation that is characterized by the unique set of conditions on which it is based. The Project Snapshot business object represents a specialization of a project. It is a copy of the whole project at a certain point in time and is used for determining for example planned scope vs. actual scope milestone trend analysis or earned value analysis.

The Costing process component contains two business objects three inbound process agents and one interface. The business objects include a Project Cost Estimate business object and an Accounting View on Project business object . The inbound process agents include a Sync Simulate Project Cost Estimate inbound process agent a Maintain Project Cost Estimate and Project Accounting View inbound process agent and a Sync Query Project Cost Estimate inbound process agent . The interface is a Project Costing In interface .

The Project Cost Estimate business object represents a listing of the project elements that incur costs. Project elements relevant to valuation include material usage resource usage external internal services and travel expenses. The Accounting View on Project business object represents a project structure in a Financials application. This project structure consists only of elements and their characteristics with respect to Financials.

In the Project Processing process component the Project business object initiates interactions associated with projects and the Project Snapshot business object initiates interactions associated with project snapshots.

In one interaction type the Project business object first sends a request to the Sync Request Project Cost Estimate Simulation from Project to Costing outbound process agent . For example the request may be to perform a synchronous project costing simulation. Here the outbound process agent invokes a synchronous Request Project Cost Estimate Simulation operation provided by the Project Costing Out interface . Upon completion of the operation the Request Project Cost Estimate Simulation operation transmits a Project Cost Estimate Simulation Request message requesting the synchronous project costing simulation be performed. Upon completion of the simulation the Request Project Cost Estimate Simulation operation receives a Project Cost Estimate Simulation Response message from the Costing process component containing the project costing information needed.

In another interaction type the Project business object first sends a request to the Request Project Cost Estimate from Project Snapshot to Costing outbound process agent . For example the request may be to inform the costing document processing about the creation or change of project elements that are costing relevant. Here the outbound process agent invokes a Request Project Cost Estimate operation provided by the Project Costing Out interface . Upon completion of the operation the Request Project Cost Estimate operation transmits a Project Cost Estimate Request message requesting the cost estimates be maintained.

In another interaction type the Project business object first sends a request to the Sync Query Project Cost Estimate from Project to Costing outbound process agent . For example the request may be to query existing project costing information. Here the outbound process agent invokes a synchronous Query Project Cost Estimate operation provided by the Project Costing Out interface . Upon completion of the operation the Query Project Cost Estimate operation transmits a Project Cost Estimate Query message requesting project costing information. After the query has been transmitted the Query Project Cost Estimate operation receives a Project Cost Estimate Response message from the Costing process component containing the project costing information needed.

In yet another interaction type the Project Snapshot business object first sends a request to the Request Project Cost Estimate from Project to Costing outbound process agent . For example the request may be to inform the costing document processing about creation change of project snapshot elements that are costing relevant. Here the outbound process agent invokes the Request Project Cost Estimate operation provided by the Project Costing Out interface . Upon completion of the operation the Request Project Cost Estimate operation transmits a Project Cost Estimate Request message requesting the cost estimates be maintained.

In a further interaction type the Project Snapshot business object first sends a request to the Sync Query Project Cost Estimate from Project Snapshot to Costing outbound process agent . For example the request may be to query existing project costing information. Here the outbound process agent invokes the Query Project Cost Estimate operation provided by the Project Costing Out interface . Upon completion of the operation the Query Project Cost Estimate operation transmits a Project Cost Estimate Query message requesting project costing information. Upon completion of the query the Query Project Cost Estimate operation receives a Project Cost Estimate Response message from the Costing process component containing the project costing information needed.

In the Costing process component interactions are initiated when a message is received from another process components. For example messages may be received from the Project Processing process component to simulate maintain or query cost estimates.

In one interaction type the Project Cost Estimate Simulation Request message is received by a synchronous Simulate Project Cost Estimate operation provided by the Project Costing In interface . Here the operation sends a request to the Sync Simulate Project Cost Estimate inbound process agent which invokes the Project Cost Estimate business object to complete the operation. Upon completion of the simulation the Simulate Project Cost Estimate operation sends a response to the originating process component by transmitting the Project Cost Estimate Simulation Response message .

In another interaction type the Project Cost Estimate Request message is received by a Maintain Project Cost Estimate operation provided by the Project Costing In interface . Here the operation sends a request to the Maintain Project Cost Estimate and Project Accounting View inbound process agent . The inbound process agent invokes the Project Cost Estimate business object and the Accounting View on Project business object to complete the operation.

In yet another interaction type a synchronous Query Project Cost Estimate operation provided in the Project Costing In interface receives the Project Cost Estimate Query message . Here the operation sends a query request to the Sync Query Project Cost Estimate inbound process agent . The inbound process agent invokes the Project Cost Estimate business object to complete the operation. Upon completion of the simulation the Query Project Cost Estimate operation sends a response to the originating process component by transmitting the Project Cost Estimate Response message .

The Project Processing process component contains a Project business object a Notify of Project to Time and Labor Management outbound process agent a Change Project based on Employee Time Calendar inbound process agent a Project Task Confirmation Out interface and a Project Task Confirmation In interface .

The Project business object represents a business operation that is characterized by the unique set of conditions on which it is based the targets to be met the organizational structure and the financial personal and time constraints on the project for example. It is structured by project elements such as phases and tasks.

The Time and Labor Management process component contains an Employee Time Confirmation View On Project business object an Employee Time Calendar business object a Maintain Employee Time Confirmation View on Project inbound process agent a Notify of Project Task Confirmation from Employee Time Calendar to Project Processing outbound process agent a Project Task Confirmation In interface and a Project Task Confirmation Out interface .

The Employee Time Confirmation View On Project business object represents a view on a project adapted for the confirmation of employee times. The Employee Time Calendar business object represents a calendar based overview of different time data planned working time absences and working time confirmations of an employee and the employee s superpositions illness vs. vacation for example .

In the Project Processing process component interactions may be initiated when a message is received or when a business object requests a notification.

In one interaction type the Project business object first sends a request to the Notify of Project to Time and Labor Management outbound process agent . For example the request may be to notify time labor management of an employee s time on a project. Here the outbound process agent invokes a Notify of Project operation provided by the Project Task Confirmation Out interface . Upon completion of the operation the Notify of Project operation transmits an Employee Time Confirmation View on Project Notification message requesting the project notification be made to time and labor management.

In another interaction type a Project Task Confirmation Notification message received from the Time and Labor Management process component may initiate interaction. The Project Task Confirmation Notification message is received by a Change Project based on Employee Time Calendar operation provided by the Project Task Confirmation In interface . Here the operation sends a request to the Change Project based on Employee Time Calendar inbound process agent . The inbound process agent invokes the Project business object to complete the operation. For example the project is updated with the working times and additional information such as status short text remaining work etc.

In the Time and Labor Management process component interactions may be initiated when a message is received or when a business object requests a notification.

In one interaction type the Employee Time Confirmation View on Project Notification message is received from the Project Processing process component . The Employee Time Confirmation View on Project Notification message is received by a Maintain Employee Time Confirmation View On Project operation provided by the Project Task Confirmation In interface . Here the operation sends a request to the Maintain Employee Time Confirmation View on Project inbound process agent . The inbound process agent invokes the Employee Time Confirmation View On Project business object to complete the operation. For example the project is updated with the working times and additional information such as status short text remaining work etc.

In another interaction type the Employee Time Calendar business object first sends a request to the Notify of Project Task Confirmation from Emp Time Calendar to Project Processing outbound process agent . For example the request may be to provide an employee s time calendar to project processing. Here the outbound process agent invokes a Notify of Project Task Confirmation operation provided by the Project Task Confirmation Out interface . Upon completion of the operation the Notify of Project Task Confirmation operation transmits a Project Task Confirmation Notification message notifying project processing of a project task confirmation or a project task status change. This notification is sent when an active employee time with project relevant information is created changed or cancelled.
