title: Method of subdividing a plot of land for housing and a housing subdivision so formed
abstract: A method for sub-division of a plot of land comprises the steps of forming, on a polygonal basic tile shape, a layout of a basic precinct unit comprising an array of occupiable spaces of predetermined shape, at least one access way communicating with each occupiable space and tessellating the polygonal basic tile shapes over an area to be sub-divided whereby respective said at least one access way of each basic precinct unit connects with an access way of an adjacent basic precinct unit to form a network of connecting access ways, said basic precinct unit, together with an adjacent basic precinct unit forming an inter-tile unit of predetermined shape from two or more adjacent occupiable spaces, said inter-tile unit linking adjacent basic precinct units. The tessellation is formed computationally and the computation may include dimensional, boundary and topographical contour data of a plot of land to be subdivided.

This application claims the benefit of Australian Application No. 2004900191 filed Jan. 16 20004 and PCT AU2005 000030 filed Jan. 13 2005 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

This invention is concerned with a method for sub division of a plot of land and a sub division so formed.

The invention is generally concerned with domestic dwellings in a housing development which comprises repetitive forms of housing where each housing unit sits on its own plot of land.

The invention is concerned particularly although not exclusively with a method of planning and design that generates housing layouts types of housing units the form and distribution of the spaces between the housing units and the characteristics of the roads that serve each unit.

Individual ownership of discreet areas of land has been a fundamental desire of many human beings expressing their nature as both an acquisitive and social animal.

The simplest form of ownership is a land title granted by the state that designates the boundaries of the land the owner and the entitlement that the owner has as owner.

As world population numbers and densities increase there is a continuous demand for larger numbers of land titles to be issued. The process of dividing a large area of land into smaller areas is generally referred to as sub division.

In order to make use of any land area either as a single individual as a family or as a social or enterprise group it is necessary to gain access to it in some way and to gain access to essential services that make habitation of the land environmentally commercially and humanly sustainable.

This access is normally achieved by incorporating public road and service distribution systems within the land sub divisions or legalizing some entitlement which allows shared access with another land owner or owners.

The area occupied by the road access system is essentially shared land owned by a group normally the state who also control the limits and rules associated with the granting of new land titles.

The whole process is often referred to as town planning. The reasons for a landowner to allow or encourage his land to be sub divided are almost always associated with profit. A large plot of land is normally less valuable than that same plot divided into smaller saleable sections provided there is access to each individual parcel or lot.

The basic technique for sub dividing land starts with the arrangement of the access system. Often the road system is already in place and the sub division is simply a process cutting the land into narrower plots that continue to share the same public road. However sometimes it is necessary to provide new roads entering the land to be sub divided. These roads are usually arranged according to some preconceived notion of how the land will then be sub divided and they determine to a great extent the appearance of the final sub division.

It is the normal practice when creating a sub division to create these roads first in a grid or other pattern and to then divide the land so that each block has access to them. An alternate process involves the creation of groups of land with a perimeter of access way attached to it that can be arranged in a pattern on the site.

The land occupied by roads is essentially not saleable and so it is important to reduce the land occupied by such roads.

There are many ways of doing this including the adoption of very narrow long blocks the use of narrow roads management of the hierarchy of access ways to allow them to be narrower shared access or the adoption of new forms of land title such as group or strata title.

All of these operate on an outside in approach where access ways are created first with the sub division working away from them or the sub division is created within a perimeter of access or service corridors. This approach tends to cause the access ways to dominate the design and particularly in dense sub divisions when groups of buildings are attached to each other cause the area occupied by roads to be large when compared to the land they give access to. This approach also tends to force the access ways to define the major social aspects of the development or the way in which the occupiers of the land will react with each other once the land is occupied. This forcing is at its most obvious when the lots are small and is typical of very dense landed property developments such as row or terrace housing.

This forcing of social outcome is generally considered to be a negative by many sociologists and town planners. Most sociologists believe that it is important for human beings to have distinct private or their own family space semi private or space in which they mix with people they are familiar with and public or space in which they mix with strangers. It is important that private space is buffered by a layer of semi private space. Many criminologists also agree that this sort of arrangement reduces crime rates and improves the security of residential communities.

Previous attempts to optimize land utilization in a sub division project whilst retaining some sense of aesthetics generally have related to schemes for land sub division with or without schemes for arrangement of building structures on sub divided plots. Other attempts at optimization of land usage have related to specific structural configurations of buildings to optimize occupant amenity in a high density environment.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 623 296 describes a multistorey structure to accommodate trailer homes and the like in a more efficient and aesthetically pleasing manner.

A physical arrangement of pre constructed building modules described in U.S. Pat. No. 3 629 983 is said to achieve efficiency of construction and economy of land use. Similarly U.S. Pat. No. 3 678 639 describes a mobile home arrangement which enables the configuration of two or more mobile homes to give the appearance of a single conventional dwelling.

U.S. Pat. No. 3 720 023 describes a complex array of patio houses arranged in such a way as to reduce building costs whilst maximizing land utilization.

Other techniques for maximizing land utilization in a residential sub division utilize common walls between adjacent building structures or rigidly proscribed layouts of building structures land plot shapes and access roadways. Examples of sub divisions utilizing common walls between adjacent structures are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 732 649 3 874 137 3 996 709 4 325 205 and 4 920 711.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 575 977 4 679 363 4 852 213 5 671 570 5 761 857 and 6 470 633 each deal with residential land sub division on a micro scale but the inflexibility of the micro sub divisional regions or units when applied on a macro scale do not achieve the combination of flexible land use optimization and general amenity as provided with the present invention.

Terrace or row house sub division represents the densest form of landed property development currently available. However in a row or terrace house development there is almost no semi private space. Houses face directly onto a major street with only a small exposed yard separating them from it. The streets are through streets generally carrying traffic from a large radius around any individuals home. They are often used as alternative access to commuters passing through the area.

In order to overcome these undesirable outcomes new forms of title have been created for residential and to a limited extent commercial developments.

Often called group title or cluster housing these allow for the development of larger pieces of land on which a cluster of dwellings or other buildings are built normally attached to each other. The ownership of the land is shared while often the buildings are owned by individual titles. The social outcome is considered by many to be better while the ownership or tenure is no doubt less secure and potentially less valuable.

Generally speaking housing units that sit on their own plots of land are called landed property. Such housing units may be detached as in the bungalow or linked. Common types of linked housing units are the semi detached house the terrace house and the cluster house which comprises four or more housing units in one block.

In a conventional repetitive housing development housing units are repeated along a road resulting in rows or blocks of houses called row housing. In many countries government authorities such as Local Governments State and Federal Town and Regional Planning Departments the Construction Industry Development Board and the Fire and Rescue Departments have strict guidelines on the design of repetitive housing units on landed property particularly as they relate to row housing. In general the most efficient way to put as many housing units on each acre of land is by arranging row housing orthogonally in a regular grid plan.

Given land boundaries that form irregular shapes and geographical features that form naturally the rigid orthogonal grid arrangement may not be suitable. Moreover in order to achieve more interesting designs the orthogonal grid may be adjusted by curving or bending the roads and rows of houses to follow the natural contours and boundaries. Alternatively the orthogonal grid may be replaced by a radial grid to achieve more interesting forms or the dimensions of the basic housing unit or row of units may be altered to better fit the land. Often multiple grids are employed within a housing site and consequently various row housing layout patterns result from prior art housing sub division methods.

However as a general rule it is safe to conclude that the more irregular the more organic the plan of a row housing layout the less efficient becomes the layout in terms of land usage.

Where cost and land use efficiency is a priority the social features of row housing suffer. In row housing estates the road is the public space that fronts each house unit. That road is designed for the car rather than the pedestrian rendering it less suitable for social interaction and unsuitable as a play area for smaller children. That road is also a public domain accessible not only to the residents and their guests but also to uninvited strangers and potential criminals. The longer and the more interconnected the roads inviting faster traffic speeds and potential criminals the more unsafe is the public space just outside the house. There may be public amenities like playgrounds and green spaces in a housing estate but these may be streets away unsuitable for smaller children to go to their own and being public areas subject to vandalism and neglect.

Poor housing forms can contribute to social dysfunction. Social and human factors play the major role in creating good neighbourhoods but housing design too can play a role. Studies of prior art housing communities have focussed on three important issues 

Jan Gehl Life Between Buildings 1971 presented empirical evidence that correlated housing design features which inhibited or promoted social interaction. Oscar Newman an architect modified the buildings of public housing in New York housing that could be described as crime ridden slums. He found that certain design features successfully reduced crime. His design strategy described in his book Defensible Space 1972 was to modify the public spaces around the houses that are no man s land such that the residents are given ownership of these shared spaces. Charles Mercer Living in Cities 1975 citing the work of Lee Rainwater 1966 and John Elizabeth Newson 1968 posited that play is an important arena for learning for the child that growing up can be seen as a process where the child becomes more and more independent of the parent exploring first the spaces around the mother other rooms in the house the front yard and so on. In this work he considered that the opportunity for exploring new environment is best presented in small discreet steps so that the child can explore them at his own pace.

A problem with a typical urban or suburban situation is that the process of exploring new territory independent of the parent stops at the front gate. Beyond that is not considered safe. When a child is finally old enough to go out unaccompanied by an adult he or she is disadvantaged compared to a child that could explore bit by bit the neighbourhood around the home. This suggests that the space outside the home should be made conducive to the growing up process. It should be safe for smaller children with ample play and civic amenities. Play areas with parks or sports fields some minutes away from the home do not serve this function.

It is possible when designing row housing to design a road network in such a way as to create more exclusive semi private pedestrian friendly zones by creating looping roads cul de sacs and placing green spaces in front of each house but this will reduce the land use efficiency increase the cost of the development and render it either unaffordable to the public or commercially unfeasible. Similarly where cost is a priority the aesthetic features of the row housing suffer because land use efficiency requires 

Generally speaking the more irregular the shape of the housing unit the wider its frontage the more articulated the facade the more expensive becomes the development cost.

In the particular case of the terrace house which is the most land efficient and hence the most common type of row housing the long block of terrace houses does not fit well on naturally sloping or undulating sites. It is cheaper to excavate hills and fill valleys and streams to provide relatively flat platforms for the long blocks. Extensive earthworks is a cheaper alternative than the extra construction cost incurred when level changes are introduced within the block. Environmentally this is a particularly grave disadvantage of row terrace housing as the natural terrain and environment of hills and valleys is flattened and natural steams replaced with concrete drains.

It is an aim of the invention to overcome or alleviate at least some of the disadvantages of prior art methods for sub division of land.

It would be desirable to provide a novel design method of planning repetitive housing resulting in novel types of housing units and layout that can overcome the social aesthetic and environmental shortcomings of row housing but which meets the test of commercial viability in keeping down the cost of land infrastructure and earthworks and render the new types of houses affordable. In particular it would be desirable to find a viable alternative to the terrace house as the most cost efficient building type for landed property development.

It would be desirable also to improve the pattern of roads and public spaces that serve housing units and to create better neighbourhoods which increase the value of a housing development. At the same time it would be most desirable to achieve better land use efficiency and to reduce infrastructure costs.

According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method for sub division of a plot of land said method comprising the steps of 

forming on a polygonal basic tile shape a layout of a basic precinct comprising an array of occupiable spaces of predetermined shape at least one access way communicating with each occupiable space and

If required said polygonal basic tile shape may comprise a plurality of polygonal sub tiles of predetermined shape.

Suitably each said polygonal sub tile may comprise a layout including at least portion of an occupiable space and at least portion of an access way.

Alternatively said sub tiles may comprise an array of discrete occupiable spaces and at least one access way.

If required said basic tile shapes may be tessellated to form a super tile shape containing provision for public amenities.

According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a land sub division whenever effected according to the foregoing method s .

According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method for sub division of a plot of land said method characterized by the steps of 

inputting into a processing device dimensional boundary and topographical contour data of a plot of land to be sub divided 

selecting from a data storage means associated with said processing device at least one polygonal basic tile shape 

forming on said polygonal basic tile shape a layout of a basic precinct unit comprising an array of occupiable spaces selected from a stored range of predetermined shapes and at least one access way communicating with each occupiable space 

computing a tessellation of said polygonal basic tile shapes over a computer surface of said plot of land within a predetermined dimensional ratio whereby respective said at least one access way of each basic precinct unit connects with an access way of an adjacent basic precinct unit to form a network of connecting access ways over said computer surface of said plot of land to be sub divided each said basic precinct unit together with an adjacent basic precinct unit forming an inter tile unit of predetermined shape from two or more adjacent occupiable spaces said inter tile unit linking communal spaces of adjacent basic precinct units and 

According to a still further aspect of the invention there is provided a computer software programme for sub dividing land according to the aforesaid method said software programme being adapted to form tile units and sub units according to predetermined ratios of occupiable space and access ways comprised in a basic precinct unit said software permitting tessellation of said tile units over a predetermined land area whereby selected tile units are manipulable to allow interconnection of precinct unit access ways to form a network of interconnecting access ways.

If required said software may form tessellatable super tile shapes comprising a plurality of tessellated tile units.

Preferably said software is adapted to permit a best fit adaptation of tessellatable shapes comprising said precinct units to a predetermined land boundary and or land contour variations.

As used herein the expression occupiable space means any space to which a right of occupancy pertains either by way of ownership title lease agreement rental agreement or any other agreement by which an occupier is legally entitled to occupy having rights of access or entry to and or to use the occupiable space in a manner approved by or with the consent of the owner thereof.

While the present invention is illustrated by reference to sub division of a plot of and for housing or residential purposes it should be understood that the invention is equally applicable to the sub division of land space for commercial developments including factories shops and offices. Accordingly expressions such as precinct access way common space and communal space each will have a meaning which may differ according to the context in which those expressions are used. By way of example but not by way of limitation common space and or communal space may in some contexts mean publicly available space but in the context say of a gated or closed community common space and or communal space may refer to spaces accessible only by members of that community or otherwise only with the consent or permission of one or more members of that community. Similarly access way in certain contexts could include common space or communal space .

For the sake of simplicity like reference numerals are employed in the drawings for like features where convenient.

Throughout this specification and claims which follow unless the context requires otherwise the word comprise and variations such as comprises or comprising will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or group of integers or steps but not the exclusion of any other integer or group of integers.

The expression tessellate originated in the paving of surfaces with mosaic tiles to form a fully covered surface with a pattern without gaps and with no overlapping. When tiles are fitted together to cover a surface a tessellation occurs. The tiles can be a square or any polygon or any pattern so long as certain mathematical rules are satisfied.

Existing planning methods where individual housing units are repeated to form blocks and blocks repeated to form rows of blocks could be described as tessellations of a rectangular pattern however tessellating rectangles is but a small subset of all possible tessellations.

Tessellations of just a few basic tile designs utilizing rectangular and or other polygonal shapes can result in complex and beautiful decorative patterns for paving and other decorated surfaces. Although such patterns may appear to be a combination of many interlocking polygonal shapes these patterns may be achieved with plain or decorated tile elements which fit together to form a tile member which in turn fits together with other tile members to form what otherwise appears to be a complex pattern of geometric shapes.

The hexagonal shape of basic unit is in fact comprised of tessellated triangular sub units or elements each representing a pair of basic layout patterns as shown in .

The polygon that contains this basic neighbourhood arrangement is then tessellated as shown in . The resulting pattern produces a housing layout which differs from a conventional row housing layout in the following ways 

1. The shape and arrangement of the external spaces between the housing units including the distribution of the public spaces and the pattern of the network of roads.

2. The shape of the individual housing lots the relationship between adjoining housing lots and the potential for linkages between them.

3. The complex configuration of layout and patterns is made up of only the two basic triangular tile patterns.

Consistent with the expression tessellation as described hereinafter the basic hexagonal housing unit is referred to as a tile and the sub units or elements which combine to form the tile shapes are called sub tiles.

By designing tile as shown in and this results in a basic neighbourhood unit comprising a group of houses each clustered around a central courtyard or communal garden . Tile can be replicated to form three interconnected neighbourhoods as shown in wherein Type A sub tiles join with adjacent Type A sub tiles of adjacent tiles to form a Y shaped inter tile . As shown joining sub tiles permits the formation of a Y shaped service road that connects three courtyards 

According to the planning method of the present invention sites can be of arbitrary shape and may not fit in the row housing placed in an orthogonal gridline manner. Adjustments have to be made at the boundaries of the site. Similarly for this method of planning special case adjustments have to be made at the edges of the site as shown in the example given in which represents a small site of approximately 40 acres. Super tiles are not required in this example as the area may be tessellated with the basic neighbourhood units as shown in and employing a mixture of semi detached houses as shown in semi detached row houses as shown in quadriplex units as shown in and bungalows as shown in . In the subdivision shown there are 393 housing units located on 37.1 acres giving an average density of 10.57 units acre with a total green area of 5.6 acres. The subdivision comprises 72 semi detached houses 58 semi detached row houses 248 quadriplex units and bungalows . Suitably a main road surrounds the subdivision .

For larger areas such as that shown in super tiles with elements of a higher hierarchy including distribution roads central pars etc. are included.

Linking the design intent to each step in the method of design provides a good way to describe the features of the repetitive housing produced. Studying in quantitative terms the design implications of tessellated housing and contrasting these against row housing provides another.

At a macro level a super tile such as that shown in can become a basic tile unit. This basic tile unit comprises housing units with a service road. This ensures all units have a public access reserve which may be required by Land Laws pertaining to the subdivision of land.

Also included is a communal garden for each housing cluster. The inventor believes that common play areas just outside the house gate is important in a child s environment especially at pre school age.

The basic tile unit as shown in is triangular one of the standard housing lots is a funnel shaped trapezium sub unit as shown in and represented as a Type B sub tile as shown in . This is in contrast to the most efficient form of housing lot in row housing comprising a narrow frontaged rectangle. The implications of the geometry is discussed quantitatively further below.

In a connecting service road is required to link the cul de sac to other neighbourhood units or to a distribution road. This is the basic road pattern employed in the tessellation technique according to the invention. Such a road pattern contrasts with that of the street in row housing but it is also different from cul de sacs that arise from row housing not only in a qualitative sense but quantitatively as well.

There may be two types of inter tiles containing housing land lots. The inter tiles have different properties the shape of the individual housing lots the relationship between adjoining housing lots and the potential for linkages between them. The resulting house types thus are clearly different from the types of buildings found in row housing.

One aspect of the difference is that apart from the duplex houses the linkages in tessellated housing are symmetrical in two axes. This means that there no long blocks as in terrace houses.

As illustrated in for duplex houses the natural axis of symmetry is back to back rather then side to side.

The next step in the design process is to incorporate additional elements required for a higher level of township or community hierarchy.

Public amenities such as parks halls and other public buildings can be included in the neighbourhood precinct to meet the requirements of the larger community. Such amenities may in any case be compulsory under local Planning Regulations. These amenities may be incorporated in larger tiles or super tiles which in turn may be further tessellated to create a larger sub division.

In the example of the tessellated layout shown in the road network is dominated by short stretches of connecting roads roundabouts and cul de sac features that slow down traffic speed. This contrasts with that of existing road patterns arising from row housing. In fact the higher the level of hierarchy the greater the amount of traffic and the greater the priority given to the car. At the lower level of the hierarchy the pedestrian is given priority.

A road network may be considered as a structured hierarchy determined by levels of accessibility. The more accessible a place the more public it is and conversely the less accessible the place the more private it becomes. This structured hierarchy of public semi public and semi private zones is an important feature achieved from structured tessellation planning and can create defensible spaces in the community sub units.

In Table 1 a tessellation layout on a 20 acre site is compared with that of terrace houses in a site of similar area. The layout of each scheme is according to their respectively most efficient forms the row housing with dwellings being laid out in a rigid rectangular grid and a communal green space as shown in whereas the equivalent tessellated sub divisional layout is shown in the tessellated housing forming a triangle.

Even in a two dwelling comparison involving 2 tessellated detached houses and 2 rows detached houses shown in the tessellated layout is the more efficient as indicated in Table 5.

The advantages of the method according to the present invention may be illustrated by a consideration of prior art sub divisional systems.

This road can be reduced by shortening the service road as shown in . However this results in an uneven distribution of land area and shape as found in existing cul de sac developments. These odd shaped lots are not considered desirable and as such makes such developments comparatively rare.

Developing further from the comparison between the tessellation housing layout and the terrace housing layout the dimensions of the lots are expressed as variables and the ratio of road to green to house is calculated as formulas and land use efficiency defined as follows 

The land use efficiency of both tessellated and terrace housing is compared across varying lot sizes and frontages. It is seen that the efficiency of the terrace house layout improves when the frontage is made narrower and narrower as shown in wherein the upper curves represent tesselar housing and the lower curves represent terrace housing both having frontages where A 18 ft B 20 ft C 22 ft and D 24 ft.

To maximize usage of that land the building itself must also follow or approximate the funnel shape of the land. The geometry of the most efficient building form on a funnel shaped land contrasts with that of a rectangular land.

For example a typical bungalow lot of 557.6 sm in a conventional layout is compared with a typical bungalow lot of same size in a tessellated layout. Both typical lots are subjected to local government setback requirements to arrive at the maximum footprint allowable.

In the maximum plinth area of a tessellated bungalow lot is 233.3 sm compared to the conventional bungalow plinth area of 223.0 sm as shown in . This represents a 4.6 increase amounting to 10.3 sm.

Table 6 represents a comparative feasibility study between a conventional terrace housing layout and equivalent tessellated housing layout on the same site represented respectively in .

In the layout of the total land area is 37.1 acres comprising 5.6 acres of green space and 186 Type terrace houses 150 Type terrace houses and 88 Type terrace houses giving a density of 11.43 units acre for a conventional terrace row housing development.

In contrast the layout of shows a tessellation layout which permits on the same total land area of 37.1 acres comprising 5.6 acres of green space 72 semi detached houses 58 semi detached houses 248 quadriplex units and bungalows giving a density of 10.57 units acre.

In this comparison differences in saleable land areas are taken into account as is savings in construction cost for infrastructure. Thus in this example only the advantages of tessellation housing due to its land use efficiency is taken into account. Using conservative estimates of the reduction in the cost of infrastructure the value added to the project by the tessellation layout is already 6 of the development cost. A more realistic study taking into account the full extent of the advantages of tessellation housing in terms of saleable value and cost can easily double the added value.

It will be readily apparent to a person skilled in the art that the land subdivision processes according to the invention offer substantial advantages over conventional rectangular grid like subdivisions not only in terms of improved profitability to developers but more importantly in terms of improved amenity for site occupants.

The reasons for this are complex and associated with aesthetics traffic control crime prevention and other social factors.

What Town Planners want to see in a subdivision is a non linear layout. Straight lines are perceived as being bad for neighbourhood traffic bad socially bad in terms of crime prevention and aesthetically sterile.

Automated land division is easy with a simple grid which can be expressed mathematically according to a set of rules provided by the developer and controlled by rules set by local authorities. The rules with which the automation process is most often driven are related to road widths plot size frontage and buildable area. Buildable area is related to plot dimensions and a series of rules most of which are set back rules.

The formulae that arise within an automated system for simple orthogonal grids are all linear. All areas are calculated as simple squares or rectangles and are relatively simple to understand and operate. They are so simple that it is possible to arrive at economic solutions using simple manual iteration.

When the subdivision is non orthogonal automation of this sort is difficult. Some of the formulae that drive these relationships are quadratic. It is no longer possible to investigate the relationships between plot size frontage and setbacks using a few iterations and real mathematics must be used to investigate economic solutions.

The reason that quadratics come into play is that most plot areas or buildable areas are partly square or rectangular and partly triangular often expressed as AREA squared plus not simply AREA which is usually the case for an orthogonal grid 

The solution to the quadratic equation of this sort is X B plus or minus the square root of B minus 4 multiplied by A multiplied by minus AREA all divided by 2 multiplied by A

If the subdivision design is standardized that is it becomes repeatable but non orthogonal the problems identified by planners associated with orthogonal grids are avoided but it is still possible to drive the mathematical evaluation relatively simply.

A further aspect of this invention will be to develop such a system and imbed it in packages that can be used by other designers. Such a package would include 

Using these inputs the software will create the optimum tile. Operator will be able to manually adjust to modify the automatically generated tile.

After setting out the site on AutoCAD or similar drafting package a simple command tile will create an overall pattern. The pattern will automatically be created with the greatest number of complete tiles possible on the site. Roads will be created using mouse commands rotating and or linking individual tiles.

A best fit command will automatically create all possible perimeter blocks by combining unusable truncated pieces with others or attaching them to other blocks.

Operator can manually adjust best fit solutions and modify grid positioning to check for more optimal solutions.

By overlaying the site contours the software will provide the best arrangement of platform levels for each lot controlling the cut and fill sections to balance.

Other design and quantity surveying costing tools can be added to create very user friendly software packages.

An example of an automated tessellation of a plot of land to establish subdivisional boundaries is illustrated in additional drawing .

In the land to be subdivided is bounded on two sides by existing main roads and comprises five separate precincts and surrounding a central lake or pond and a communal facility such as a clubhouse . Precincts and are separated by pathways and portions of precincts and are intersected by pathways to form sub precincts and respectively.

Each of precincts and are comprised of differing basic tile shapes identified as Types A B C D and E tiles which are illustrated in respectively.

It can be seen therefore that while the tesselation process can be automated the capacity to utilize differing basic tile configurations in the tessellation process avoids highly ordered or repetitious visual appearances in a built subdivision with a sufficient level of distinction between property types at both a micro and macro level within the overall sub divisional development.
