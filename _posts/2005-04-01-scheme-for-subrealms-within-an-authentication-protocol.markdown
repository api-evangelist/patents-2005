title: Scheme for sub-realms within an authentication protocol
abstract: Branch domain controllers (DCs) contain read only replicas of the data in a normal domain DC. This includes information about the groups a user belongs to so it can be used to determine authorization information. Password information, however, is desirably replicated to the branch DCs only for users and services (including machines) designated for that particular branch. Moreover, all write operations are desirably handled by hub DCs, the primary domain controller (PDC), or other DCs trusted by the corporate office. Rapid authentication and authorization in branch offices is supported using Kerberos sub-realms in which each branch office operates as a virtual realm. The Kerberos protocol employs different key version numbers to distinguish between the virtual realms of the head and branch key distribution centers (KDCs). Accounts may be named krbtgt_<ID> where <ID> is carried in the kvno field of the ticket granting ticket (TGT) to indicate to the hub KDC which krbtgtâ€² key was used to encrypt the TGT.

This invention relates to computer systems and more particularly to authentication and authorization of devices using a central trusted authority in distributed environments.

Ever since the advent of digital computers access control has been an important topic of computer security. To protect the integrity of computer systems and the confidentiality of important data various access control schemes have been implemented to prevent unauthorized users and malicious attackers from gaining access to computer resources.

Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is in fact who or what it is declared to be. In private and public computer networks including the Internet authentication is commonly done through the use of usernames and passwords. Knowledge of a password is assumed to verify the user s identity. Each user registers initially using an assigned or self declared password. On each subsequent use the user must know and use the previously declared password. Many institutions require a more stringent authentication process than the simple username and password approach.

An authentication protocol is a sequence of steps that is carried out in an authentication. When a client desires a connection to a server authentication is required. An exemplary authentication protocol is Kerberos. According to the Kerberos protocol authentication of the connection to the server is accomplished via a ticket. The ticket is initially received by the client from a ticket issuing facility on the network known as a key distribution center KDC . The ticket is re useable for a period of time whereby even if the session is terminated the client does not have to repeat the authentication process while the ticket is still valid.

Thus various schemes based on different protocols such as the Kerberos protocol have been proposed and implemented for controlling network access control by means of user authentication. Generally the user logon for a computer and the user authentication for network access control are two separate procedures. Nevertheless to minimize the burden on a user in dealing with the different access control schemes the user logon and the user authentication for network access are sometimes performed together. For example in the case where the user authentication is implemented under the Kerberos protocol when the user logs on the computer the computer may also initiate a Kerberos authentication process. In the authentication process the computer contacts a Kerberos KDC to first obtain a ticket granting ticket TGT for the user. The computer can then use the TGT to obtain from the KDC a session ticket for itself.

Kerberos realms are used today to support directly e.g. Microsoft Active Directory authentication and authorization. A Kerberos realm is defined by a single central authentication authority implemented by a KDC. In cases where organization structures span across large geographical areas such as the ones employing branch offices it is common to deploy local synchronized instances of KDCs in order to provide quick authentication. However this approach creates security issues as the branch offices are often located in untrusted locations.

The following summary provides an overview of various aspects of the invention. It is not intended to provide an exhaustive description of all of the important aspects of the invention nor to define the scope of the invention. Rather this summary is intended to serve as an introduction to the detailed description and figures that follow.

The present invention provides a way to mitigate the security risks associated with deploying domain controllers on branch offices while supporting rapid authentication and authorization by using Kerberos sub realms in which each branch office operates as a virtual realm. According to an embodiment the Kerberos protocol employs different key version numbers to distinguish between the virtual realms of the head and branch key distribution centers KDCs .

According to aspects of the present invention a branch ID as opposed to the realm name is used to distinguish between multiple virtual realms.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be made apparent from the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments that proceeds with reference to the accompanying drawings.

The subject matter is described with specificity to meet statutory requirements. However the description itself is not intended to limit the scope of this patent. Rather the inventors have contemplated that the claimed subject matter might also be embodied in other ways to include different steps or combinations of steps similar to the ones described in this document in conjunction with other present or future technologies. Moreover although the term step may be used herein to connote different elements of methods employed the term should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except when the order of individual steps is explicitly described.

An authentication protocol is a sequence of steps that are carried out in an authentication. Many authentication protocols have been designed to authenticate computing devices as well as applications data or other content.

While aspects of this invention will be described for clarity in an environment of discrete and remote computers the invention can also be applied to authentication protocols in any environment including application authentication data authentication user authentication remote device authentication process authentication and the like. Several kinds of authentication protocols will be described herein for the purpose of introducing terms and concepts in authentication of computing processes but this is not intended as a list of possible authentication protocols for use with the invention. It will be acknowledged that the invention can be used in conjunction with any authentication protocol.

Kerberos is an authentication protocol that has experienced wide use. Kerberos was created by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT and named for a three headed dog that guarded the gates of the underworld in Greek mythology. and the following brief discussion provide a conceptual illustration of Kerberos for use in conjunction with embodiments of the invention. The three headed dog symbolizes the three processes utilized by Kerberos the client the server and the key distribution center KDC . The client and the server are sometimes referred to as principals. The KDC may comprise an authentication server AS A and a ticket granting server TGS B.

Under the Kerberos protocol when a client wants to establish a session with a service it has to have a session key and a session ticket for the purpose of authenticating itself with that service. The session key and the session ticket are issued by a Kerberos KDC upon request by the client. Since the KDC is itself a service the client has to first obtain a session key and a session ticket for transactions with the KDC before it can request for session keys and tickets for other services. This special session ticket for communicating with the KDC is called a ticket granting ticket TGT and the associated session key is called a logon session key. When the client wants to access a service other than the KDC it sends a request including the TGT to the KDC for a session ticket for that service. The KDC responds to the request by issuing a session ticket for the target service to the client which then uses the service session ticket to access the target service.

The Kerberos protocol includes three subprotocols. The subprotocol in which the KDC gives a client a logon session key and a TGT is known as the authentication service AS exchange. The subprotocol in which the KDC distributes a service session key and a session ticket for a requested service to the client is known as the ticket granting service TGS exchange. The subprotocol in which the client presents the session ticket for admission to a service is called the application protocol AP exchange.

Kerberos currently employs shared private keys symmetric encryption . The authentication process proceeds as follows with reference to A client sends a request to an AS A requesting credentials for a given server . This request is called an authentication service request AS REQ . The AS A responds with the requested credentials encrypted in the client s key. The credentials consist of 1 a ticket for the server and a temporary encryption key often called a session key . This response is called an authentication service reply AS REP .

The client transmits the ticket which contains the client s identity and a copy of the session key all encrypted in a private server key to the server . This transmission is designated in by the communication arrow . This transmission is called the authentication protocol request AP REQ . The session key now shared by the client and server is used by the server to authenticate the client by decrypting the client s identity and may optionally be used to authenticate the server . If the client requests authentication of the server thereby providing two way authentication the client can encrypt a time stamp using the session key and transmit it to the server along with the ticket. Only the server will be able to decrypt the time stamp because only the server could decrypt the ticket to obtain the session key. The server can then return the time stamp portion to the client encrypted in the session key thereby authenticating itself to the client . The server reply to the client is called the authentication protocol reply AP REP .

The session key may be used to encrypt further communication between the two parties or to exchange a separate subsession key to be used to encrypt further communication. A subsession key can be any key for use in encrypting and decrypting communications between two or more computers. It is an encryption and or decryption key that is used subsequently to a first encryption and or decryption key.

Remaining with Kerberos implementation consists of one or more authentication servers A running on physically secure hosts . The authentication servers A maintain a database of principals i.e. clients and servers and their secret keys. Code libraries provide encryption and implement the Kerberos protocol. In order to add authentication to its transactions a typical network application adds one or two calls to the Kerberos library which results in the transmission of the necessary messages to achieve authentication. The Kerberos protocol consists of several sub protocols or exchanges . There are two methods by which a client can ask a Kerberos server for credentials. In the first approach the client sends a plaintext request for a ticket for the desired server to the AS A. The reply is sent encrypted in the client s secret key. Usually this request is for a ticket granting ticket TGT which can later be used with the ticket granting server TGS B which may also be a part of the KDC . In the second method performed after the client has obtained a TGT the client sends a request to the TGS B. The client sends the TGT to the TGS B in the same manner as if it were contacting any other application server which requires Kerberos credentials. The reply is encrypted in the session key from the TGT. Once obtained credentials may be used to verify the identity of the principals in a transaction to ensure the integrity of messages exchanged between them or to preserve privacy of the messages. The application is free to choose whatever protection may be necessary.

To verify the identities of the principals in a transaction the client transmits the ticket to the server . Since the ticket is sent in the clear parts of it may be encrypted but this encryption does not thwart replay and might be intercepted and reused by an attacker additional information is sent to prove that the message was originated by the client to whom the ticket was issued. This information called the authenticator is encrypted in the session key and includes a timestamp as mentioned above. The timestamp proves that the message was recently generated and is not a replay. Encrypting the authenticator in the session key proves that it was generated by a party possessing the session key. Since no one except the client and the server know the session key it is never sent over the network in the clear this guarantees the identity of the client .

The integrity of the messages exchanged between principals can also be guaranteed using the session key passed in the ticket and contained in the credentials . This approach provides detection of both replay attacks and message modification attacks. It is accomplished by generating and transmitting a collision proof checksum of the client s message keyed with the session key. Privacy and integrity of the messages exchanged between principals can be secured by encrypting the data to be passed using the session key passed in the ticket and contained in the credentials.

The authentication exchanges mentioned above are usually in the context of read only access to the Kerberos database. Sometimes however the entries in the database must be modified such as when adding new principals or changing a principal s key. This is done using a protocol between a client and yet another Kerberos server the Kerberos Administration Server KADM not shown . The administration protocol is not described in this document. There is also a protocol for maintaining multiple copies of the Kerberos database but this can be considered an implementation detail and may vary to support different database technologies.

Authentication protocols can be used for any authentication. It is easy to imagine a computer user on a client computer authenticating himself to a server computer. A more subtle scenario is depicted in namely that of one or more applications A running on a client computer engaging an authentication protocol A to access desired data on a server computer . For example information for a database may be distributed across several computers. A database query initiated by an application A on a client computer may require an authentication protocol A B to access to the various machines such as server . In this situation the database application e.g. SQL SERVER or any other database application would make a function call for the retrieval of the desired information. This function call would be made a particular application program interface API . An API is a language and message format used by an application program to communicate with the operating system or some other control program such as a database management system DBMS or communications protocol. APIs are implemented by writing function calls in an application which provide the linkage to an indicated subroutine for execution.

In example embodiments the network access control is provided by means based on the Kerberos protocol. Although the following description is directed mostly to embodiments based on the Kerberos protocol it will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited thereto and can be readily adapted for use with other authentication protocols.

The following terminology is used herein. Branch domain controllers DCs are DCs that are deployed in a branch office site and their physical security is not as strong as the DCs in the corporate office. As such a compromise for a branch DC is deemed more likely. A hub DC is a DC that is set up to act as a window for the branch to communicate with the rest of the directory e.g. Microsoft Active Directory AD infrastructure. A PDC is the primary domain controller e.g. as established in Windows 2000 onwards. Main DCs include the hub DCs the PDC and for example other Windows 2003 and Windows 2000 DCs. Krbtgt is the account that represents the Kerberos AS service. This account has a key called the krbtgt key or KDC key that is used to encrypt the TGTs.

A domain controller DC is a single machine or computing device. A domain can include many DCs. A domain may also be known as a realm e.g. in Kerberos . While isolation can be achieved by splitting a given domain into multiple domains the present invention preserves the domain boundaries achieving isolation. For example attributes in Kerberos are used to extend Kerberos to achieve isolation.

The present invention supports branch office DCs. Branch office DCs are specialized DCs meant for deployment in branch offices. These DCs can potentially be compromised without compromising all of the domain. Customers have deployed DCs in branches to make authentication more efficient. However having DCs in a physically insecure branch compromises the integrity of the entire forest. Hence it is desirable to deploy a DC that will not have such a high level of risk.

A KDC is a service that runs on the DC. A directory service such as Active Directory stores information about network based entities such as applications files printers and people. A directory service also manages identities and brokers resources between distributed resources e.g. manages secret information. Kerberos KDC uses this secret information. The KDC authenticates the users because it has access to the users secrets through the directory.

In accordance with the present invention only the appropriate secrets for a particular branch are replicated to that branch. Aspects of the present invention ensure isolation of the secrets after they have been replicated. The KDCs are made to trust each other. A field in the Kerberos tickets not the realm name is used to achieve isolation.

The realm name is the highest level identifier. Although distinction may be made based on realm name it is preferable to use a key information field as set forth in accordance with the present invention which contains a key encryption type and a key version number.

Branch DCs desirably have limited privileges in the domain such that even if they are compromised they will not compromise the entire forest or domain. There are two main ways in which a branch DC may compromise the domain. One way is the injection of malicious data. Conventional branch DCs have unlimited privileges to write data. There are several ways to mitigate this including 1 allowing branch DCs to write to only certain portions of the AD database for example and 2 allowing only read operations at branch DCs such that all write operations are to be performed at the main DCs.

Another way in which a branch DC may compromise the domain is by the compromise of privileged secret information such as user and service keys that could be used to perform privileged operations. This could be mitigated by for example not letting any secret information replicate to the branch DCs this while effective would significantly reduce the benefits of deploying a DC in the branch and replicating only a subset of the secrets. For example do not replicate the secrets of users who can perform privileged operations.

In accordance with the present invention branch DCs contain read only replicas of the data that typically resides in a DC. This includes information about the groups a user belongs to so it can be used to determine authorization information. Password information however is desirably replicated to the branch DCs only for users and services including machines designated for that particular branch. Moreover all write operations are desirably handled by hub DCs the PDC or other DCs trusted by the corporate office.

Because a branch does not have all the secrets the branch can only perform authentication operations that are limited to requiring keys that are present in the branch. For Kerberos the branch DC can issue TGTs for branch users and service tickets for branch services. Also branch DCs are desirably cryptographically isolated from hub DCs such that they cannot issue tickets for users and services they are not authorized for.

Authentication requests for users not belonging to the local branch are desirably forwarded by the branch DC to the hub DC. In particular AS REQs for users not in the branch may be forwarded to the hub DC and TGS REQs may be forwarded if the user requesting it is not a local user e.g. the branch DC did not issue the TGT for this user or if the service is not a local service .

Hub DCs may trust authentication requests performed by a branch for the users belonging to that branch but desirably recalculate the privileged attribute certificate PAC for such users when they access resources not at the branch.

The distinction between users authenticated by the branch and those authenticated at the hub is made by having separate keys associated with the Krbtgt accounts in the branch and the hub.

To achieve the desired secret separation the branch DC also referred to herein as a read only domain controller or RODC has a cache of the user and machine account secrets that are used in the branch. The set of user and machine account secrets available at the RODC is based on partial replication according to policy. A read only copy of all other information in a DC is also kept at the branch DC and this allows the branch to supply group policy compute authorization information etc.

Authorization is desirably required for a given RODC to cache a given user or machine account. This may be done explicitly such that an administrator can declare that a given RODC or a given set of RODCs can cache or are denied to cache a certain set of accounts.

Each read only domain controller RODC or branch DC has a Kerberos key distribution center KDC . The KDC uses a different krbtgt password than what the head office KDC uses when signing encrypting ticket granting tickets TGTs this different password is referred to herein as krbtgt . The RODC at the branch knows only the key of the branch in question. The DCs at the head office know the key associated with the normal krbtgt account and in addition to that know the key used by each branch. In Kerberos protocol terms this means different key version numbers for the Kerberos master keys used by the head and branch KDCs.

According to an embodiment the accounts for the RODCs are named krbtgt  where is a number ranging from 1 to 2. The may be carried in a field e.g. the kvno field in the TGT as an indication to the hub KDC which krbtgt key was used to encrypt the TGT. This kvno field may be a uint32 32 bit field that can be split into two words the lower most 16 bits used for the key version number and highest most 16 bits used for the where 0 here would be reserved for the main krbtgt. It is contemplated that a krbtgt account may be created for each branch and that this account can be shared between RODCs in the same branch only.

In other words it is desirable to distinguish between claims issued by a hub KDC and a branch KDC. This distinction is made based on key version number. The key information field is 32 bits. This field is split into two 16 bit fields. One 16 bit field is used for the RODC ID and the other 16 bit field is used for the key version. The separation of the keys is performed in a domain and implemented by the RODC ID field.

The branch DC is advertised as the KDC for the desired realm in the branch office. Branch clients will preferably find the branch DC failing which they will try to find a head office DC HODC .

The kvno field is mapped to a krbtgt account as described herein step . If it is not the local krbtgt step then it is forwarded to the hub DC step otherwise the local krbtgt key is used to decrypt the TGT step and continue the code path e.g. obtains the session key from it decrypts the authenticator with the session to prove the validity of the request obtains the service key to encrypt the service ticket in response .

After verifying the preauthentication PA data step the KDC attempts to build the service ticket step . It attempts to retrieve the service key. If the service was determined to be in another domain the KDC forwards the request to the hub DC. The KDC on the RODC cannot build cross realm TGTs because of the lack of the trust keys.

If the service is not cached by this RODC then the request is forwarded to the hub DC. If the secrets for the service are available then KDC will continue as is and build the TGS REP.

At the hub KDC it is determined if the operation is a cross realm operation step . If not the hub KDC issues the service ticket step or in the case of cross realm operation a TGT to the remote realm .

Regarding TGS REQ on the hub DC on TGS REQ the KDC decrypts the TGT obtains the session key from it and decrypts the authenticator with the session to prove the validity of the request. The service key is then obtained to encrypt the service ticket in response.

Handling the TGS REQ is almost identical to how the KDC on the RODC will handle it with the following exceptions
