title: Data binding in a word-processing application
abstract: A word processor application is provided for creating word processor documents wherein the data and presentation can be separated. Data can be stored in a separate location from the presentation surface of the word processor document. Users of the word processor application can establish links (or bindings) between the contents of the data and the presentation surface. A user can modify contents of a word processor document by directly changing the linked data without having to deal with the complexity of the presentation format, which can be constantly changing. A user can modify content of a word processor document, by editing a data store without any knowledge of the current layout of the presentation surface. A user can modify complex backing data through simple document edits, without exposure to the complexities of the data structure.

Markup Languages have attained wide popularity in recent years. One type of markup language Extensible Markup Language XML is a universal language that provides a way to identify exchange and process various kinds of data. For example XML is used to create documents that can be utilized by a variety of application programs. Elements of an XML file typically have an associated namespace and schema.

A namespace is a unique identifier for a collection of names that are used in XML documents to define element attribute names and types. The name of a namespace is commonly used to uniquely identify each class of XML document. The unique namespaces differentiate markup elements that come from different sources and happen to have the same name.

XML Schemata provide a way to describe and validate data in an XML environment. A schema states what elements and attributes are used to describe content in an XML document where each element is allowed what types of content is allowed within it and which elements can appear within which other elements. The use of schemata ensures that the document is structured in a consistent and predictable manner. Schemata may be created by a user and generally supported by an associated markup language such as XML. By using an XML editor the user can manipulate the XML file and generate XML documents that adhere to the schema the user has created. In previous word processor applications support for custom XML schemas was added to the application enabling users to tag contents of a document with custom XML markup e.g. essentially giving semantic meaning to what was previously an unclassified run of text. This meant that a document which was previously just text with formatting but no meaning for other applications to process could now be a structured XML document containing specific pieces of XML markup from any user defined XML schema that any other XML aware application could locate and understand.

In a basic example the text at the top of a document could be tagged as a title with a XML element from a user defined XML schema which means that other XML aware applications can now easily understand that this range of text contains a title and extract it appropriately. This enables a backend process to intelligently extract parts of the document with appropriate semantics and context e.g. this text is the .

However the drawbacks associated with prior word processor applications stem from the fact that the addition and persistence of custom XML markup is tied to the presentation of the document. That is in the existing implementations there is an inexorable link between the XML markup of a word processor document for example the details of a customer invoice expressed in XML format and its presentation on the document surface three paragraphs of plain text followed by a table with 5 columns and 4 rows w a specific table style for example . Therefore the XML data represented in prior word processor applications because it is tied to the presentation must coincide exactly with the content of the document. For example if the XML schema for the invoice states that comes before which comes before then those three XML elements must appear in exactly that order as presented in the document. This means that changes to the presentation format e.g. moving a table row around which contains will also cause changes to the structure of the XML data contained in that document which requires extra steps on the part of the solution developer to ensure this data conforms to the structure of the associated XML schema. Thus the end user of the document is not afforded the freedom to manipulate the presentation freely because doing so might invariably change the semantics of the data potentially violating the XML schema for that data.

Additionally solutions developed on top of prior word processor applications need to more carefully consider the implications of the presentation when attempting to read write data from a document for a backend application. So if a paragraph of bold text is tagged as a title the resulting XML saved by prior word processor applications would look like 

As shown above the custom XML tagging is surrounded on both sides by XML tags that are very specific to the prior word processor application in this example w p w r etc. This means that a XML aware solution which is processing this data must not only understand its own data format which contains the element but must also understand the exact details of the prior word processor application formatting so it knows to traverse and ignore that information as it is searching for its own data. Accordingly this kind of implementation still imposes some requirements on the user because small changes in the look of the text in the document for example dragging the contents of the element into a table cell etc. can result in significant changes the location of the custom XML tags within the surrounding word processor s native tags. Thus a programmer code developer often needs to write additional code to anticipate and understand where the prior word processor applications is going to put the custom XML elements based on the presentation and deal with all of the various permutations. This means the resulting solution may still need to contain significant logic code for dealing with specific prior word processor application needs.

Programmers code developers working with the prior word processor applications also need to take into consideration the implications of a document s layout format when considering reading and writing operations. For example a user might attempt to grab the value of a element and use it to place the full name of a company in the element in the same document as a simple enhancement for a user writing a company report. To maintain the document s integrity the user needed to consider both on the reading and writing of the desired data from the document the current layout format of the document before they could write functional code to perform these actions. For example the user might need to know if the value they were writing was in a table cell a bulleted list etc. in order to construct the prior word processor application s formatting information that when inserted into the document would produce the desired result. This is another potential reason for additional coding in order to understand the word processor application s presentation semantics.

Yet another limitation of prior word processor applications is that XML elements editing behaviors can sometimes be perceived as fragile. This is partly because as discussed above they are limited by the fact that the positioning of the tags on the document surface determines the structure of the XML data based on the user defined schema. Accordingly a number of issues may arise. First typical user operations e.g. copy paste from one section to another may alter the XML structure and render the document invalid according to the associated XML schema. Second in such word processor implementations all elements required by the customer defined XML schema need to be included in some form on the document surface. This means that developers may have a hard time creating associated XML data as a method for carrying around additional information about the document which is not displayed on the document surface but serves more as metadata. And third elements which are semantically unnecessary on the document surface e.g. non leaf elements which are not marking up mixed content need to be included as well in such word processor implementations further increasing the ability of common user operations to modify the XML data.

In many cases the schema which defines the XML data for example the data that comprises a memo document tends to be rigidly defined by a single standards body in order to facilitate the communication of this data between multiple heterogeneous processing systems. However in so facilitating the backend communication often the human readability and editability of the document data is sacrificed which making it difficult for a user to understand and parse this data. For example the XML standard might define a standard format for dates such as dd mm yyyyThh mm ss.ssss. All dates are required to be represented in this format to be parsed by XML aware applications. Obviously this format is hard for the user to enter correctly and often clashes with the way in which the user typically enters dates e.g. many locales typically use mm dd yyyy instead of dd mm yyyy etc. .

Thus what is needed is a way to enable developers to separate the XML data and the presentation of such data in an application such as a word processor application.

Embodiments of the invention provide a word processor application for creating word processor documents wherein the data and presentation can be separated. More particularly data can be entered into and extracted from a word processor document which is stored in a separate location from the presentation format of the word processor document. According to embodiments of the invention users of the word processor application can create a separate storage location for the word processor document data and establish links or bindings between the contents of that data and the presentation surface. A user of the word processing application can modify content of the presentation of a word processor document by directly changing the linked data without having to deal with the complexity of the presentation format which can be constantly changing. Separating the view presentation and the data allows the user to continue to edit the document in free form while allowing the data to be represented in the persistent file format in a single known structural format. When using an external process to modify content of a word processor document a user can edit a separate piece of XML data stored within the word processor file without any knowledge of the current layout of the presentation surface or format. These links or bindings are also created such that changes to the structure of the presentation surface does not determine the structure of the XML data and conversely that changes to the structure of the XML data does determine the layout of the presentation surface of the word processor document these links can be created or broken without adversely impacting the contents of the document. Embodiments of the invention tend to simplify adding editing and extraction of structured data in a word processor document.

According to embodiments of the invention a word processor document may be tagged with semantics for specific regions of text but the associated data is now stored in a separate XML data file within the document. The data is linked to the range of text in the document i.e. tagged regions using a data binding. Accordingly data can now be stored in a consistent location the data store in its own XML data file regardless of where the data binding puts that content in the presentation surface of the document or how that data is presented. Thus a user does not have to worry about data being moved changed deleted etc. in the document because the XML structure for that data is located within the custom XML in a consistent location and cannot be affected by changes to the presentation surface. Moreover embodiments of the invention provide a programming interface for the word processor application. A user can use the programming interface to develop code for reacting to changes in the data store or one or more areas of the document.

Throughout the specification and claims the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

The term data refers to any supplementary information which is carried with referred to or used by the word processing document. This information is often large and is likely not exposed on the presentation layer of the document in its entirety.

The terms markup language or ML refer to a language for special codes within a document that specify how parts of the document are to be interpreted by an application. In a word processor file the markup language specifies how the text is to be formatted or laid out.

The term element refers to the basic unit of an XML document. The element may contain attributes other elements text and other content regions for an XML document.

The term presentation refers to the visible portion of the document the text and layout that would appear if the document were printed.

The term tag refers to a character inserted in a document that delineates elements within an XML document. Each element can have no more than two tags the start tag and the end tag. It is possible to have an empty element with no content in which case one tag is allowed.

The XML content between the tags is considered the element s children or descendants . Hence other elements embedded in the element s content are called child elements or child nodes or the element. Text embedded directly in the content of the element is considered the element s child text nodes . Together the child elements and the text within an element constitute that element s content .

The term attribute refers to an additional property set to a particular value and associated with the element. Elements may have an arbitrary number of attribute settings associated with them including none. Attributes are used to associate additional information with an element that will not contain additional elements or be treated as a text node.

The term content region refers to a bounded and or optionally labeled region of a document which serves as a container for a type of content entered by a user. See Methods System and Computer Readable Medium For Managing Specific Types of Content In An Electronic Document filed on Sep. 30 2004 and assigned U.S. Ser. No. 10 955 612 by the present assignee which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

 XPath is an operator that uses a pattern expression to identify nodes in an XML document. An XPath pattern is a slash separated list of child element names that describe a path through the XML document. The pattern selects elements that match the path.

The term XML data store refers to a container within the word processing document which provides access for storage and modification of the data in XML format for example stored in the word processor document while the file is open.

The term data binding refers to a property on a content region which determines the XPath location in one or more pieces of XML data inside a word processor document where the contents of the content region may be stored. As used herein 

Embodiments of the invention provide a word processor application for creating word processor documents wherein the storage of XML data and presentation can be separated. More particularly data which can be entered into and extracted from a word processor document is stored in a separate location from the presentation format of the word processor document. Accordingly users of the word processor application can create a separate storage location for the XML data contained within a word processor document and establish links or bindings between the contents of that data and the presentation surface enabling the user to edit the associated XML data by editing the contents of the presentation but by the same token preventing the user from changing the structure of the associated XML data. For example the data for an invoice can be stored separately as XML in the word processor file format so that moving around the positions of the links in the document does not change the structure of the separate data store. Thus backend processing of this structured data is made easier as the data now has a known structure which is unaffected by the way the user edits the document. A user can edit the data format the data including rich presentation formatting etc. in the word processor document and only the changes to the text content is pushed back to the XML data stored behind the document. According to the invention however all the data updated that are made via user interaction with the word processor document are available in an original native stream of XML. The invention therefore also enables the modification of the contents of a word processor document by directly changing the linked XML data without having to deal with the complexity of the presentation format of that data which again can be constantly changing. In so doing it greatly simplifies the addition editing and extraction of structured data in a word processor document.

Computing device may also have input device s such as keyboard mouse pen voice input device touch input device etc. Output device s such as a display speakers printer etc. may also be included. These devices are well know in the art and need not be discussed at length here.

Computing device may also contain communication connections that allow the device to communicate with other computing devices such as over a network. Communication connection is one example of communication media. Communication media may typically be embodied by computer readable instructions data structures program modules or other data in a modulated data signal such as a carrier wave or other transport mechanism and includes any information delivery media. The term modulated data signal means a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in the signal. By way of example and not limitation communication media includes wired media such as a wired network or direct wired connection and wireless media such as acoustic RF infrared and other wireless media.

System memory may also store one or more program modules such as word processor application and others described below. Word processor application is operative to provide functionality for creating editing and processing electronic documents.

According to one embodiment of the invention the word processor application comprises the WORD program from MICROSOFT Corporation. It should be appreciated however that word processor application programs from other manufacturers may be utilized to embody the various aspects of the present invention. It should further be appreciated that the various aspects of the present invention are not limited to word processor application programs but may also utilize other application programs which are capable of processing various forms of content e.g. text images pictures etc. such as spreadsheet application programs database application programs presentation application programs drawing or computer aided application programs etc.

Embodiments of the invention may be implemented as a computer process a computing system or as an article of manufacture such as a computer program product or computer readable media. The computer program product may be a computer storage media readable by a computer system and encoding a computer program of instructions for executing a computer process. The computer program product may also be a propagated signal on a carrier readable by a computing system and encoding a computer program of instructions for executing a computer process.

The word processor application includes its own namespace or namespaces and a schema or a set of schemas that is defined for use with document s associated with word processor application . The set of tags and attributes defined by the schema for word processor application define the format of document . As described below and according to embodiments of the invention the data store may include data . Preferably the schema is attached to the data within the data store . The word processor document also includes content regions created by a user as described below. More than one data store associated XML data and schema may be included as part of the word processor application . In order to provide XML data with a set of grammatical and data type rules governing the types and structure of data that may be included in a given XML data one or more XML schema may be associated with the XML data for providing the rules governing each of the XML elements and tags with which the user may annotate the given XML data . The schema includes the rules governing the order with which those elements may be applied to the XML data and specific rules associated with individual elements applied to the XML data .

Embodiments of the invention provide a word processor application operable to create word processor documents wherein the data and presentation can be separated via the presence of a separate data store which is stored with the word processing document. More particularly data which can be entered into and extracted from a word processor document is stored in one or more XML data files within the document s data store thereby separating the data from the presentation format of the word processor document . Accordingly users of the word processor application can create a separate storage location for the data of a word processor document and establish links or bindings associated with one or more content regions between the contents of that data and the presentation surface enabling the user to edit the data by editing the contents of the presentation but by the same token preventing the user from changing the structure of the data . Moving around positions of the content regions in the document does not change the structure of the XML data in the separate data store . Moreover changes made to the data presentation bold italic justification etc. do not affect the data structure. Thus backend processing of the structured data is simplified since the XML data corresponds to a known structure which is unaffected by the way a user edits the document .

Embodiments of the invention enable the modification of the contents of a word processor document by directly changing the linked data without having to deal with the complexity of the presentation format which can be constantly changing. In so doing it greatly simplifies the addition editing and extraction of structured data in a word processor document . Moreover data bindings bound to structured XML data may be moved around in the document without affecting the structure of the data. The data bindings on the content regions are preferably enabled using an XPath expression which may be defined via a user interface or programming window .

A user uses the XPath expression a standard XML method for identifying a node in an XML tree to uniquely identify a desired XML node which the document content region should be bound to. The word processing application operates to automatically parse and use the XPath to locate the desired target for the data binding region. This also means that developers familiar with the XPath standard can leverage this use of XML to create data bindings which are semi dynamic in nature. That is identifying a different target node based on other changes to the data or changes to the presentation . For example suppose a user wants to display the name of the employee who has completed the most sales in a given time period. If this information was in the XML data associated with a document a user can create an XPath expression which links to the name of the individual with the highest number of completed specifications and that link automatically shifts to the appropriate location node as the data changes. The link can also be changed between nodes through the use of code the user interface or a programming environment .

Alternatively a user can create a data binding which uniquely identifies the object representing node in the data which the document content region may be bound to. The word processing application operates to automatically determine the XPath to locate the desired target for the data binding region. However this means that in this case the data binding will have its XPath updated automatically to ensure that the data binding points at the same object as opposed to the same XPath expression.

Programming code as described briefly above may be developed to utilize the XML processing module and react to changes moving in either direction i.e. from a content region on the document surface to a node in the XML data in the data store and vice versa . A user can develop code that defines relationships between the document surface and specific content within the data store . Moreover code can be developed that reacts to changes within a bound region of the document or within the data store trapping or intercepting events such as edits additions deletions etc. For example suppose a user wants to ensure that not more than one document can use a specific title. The code based on what is input into the title node might check against a central database whether the title is already being used. If the title is taken the code may prompt the user to enter another title and or alert the user that the title is unavailable. Embodiments of the invention enable a user to write code a single time with the associated XML and the code is now portable to all document types that support the use of XML constructs without worrying about the exact semantics of the target application thereby greatly simplifying and streamlining application development.

According to embodiments of the invention a word processor document may be tagged with content regions representing semantics for specific regions of text e.g. Title Body etc. and by adding a data binding the associated text within that content region is now stored in a node inside some XML data in the data store within the document . The data is linked to the content region in the document i.e. tagged regions using one or more data bindings . Accordingly data can now be stored in a consistent location data store in its own XML stream regardless of where the data binding locates the associated content in the presentation i.e. the digital representation that a user interacts with when editing a particular document eg. a WORD window depicting a particular user document of the document or how that data is presented. Thus a user does not have to worry about data being moved around in the document because the XML data is now located within the data store in a consistent location. Moreover the data store can contain data which is not referenced by a data binding within a document . The extra data such as metadata etc. provides additional information to users such as solution developers which may not be relevant to the document user.

According to embodiments of the invention the structure of the data is kept in a separate location one or more pieces of XML data within the document s data stores thereby enabling the user to move around links i.e. data bindings in the presentation without affecting the data structure. Accordingly the structure of the XML data does not change just the presentation of the XML data associated with the word processor document changes. Thus changing the format of the data presentation in the document does not affect the structure of the data store . The user is not moving the actual data by manipulating the document surface thus the user has complete control over the presentation without having to be concerned about ramifications to the data which is being maintained separately in the store . Thus embodiments of the invention allows users to access custom XML information separate from the presentation information.

The one or more data bindings can be used to bind content of a data source XML data in the data store herein termed XML data to locations in the document . XML data as used herein includes any type of content such as text plain or richly formatted images content of a specific type dates etc. The structure of a data binding may be described as an XPath link which allows the word processor application to connect to synchronize with persist links to XML nodes in an XML data store associated with a document . The XML data store is most preferably a part of the document i.e. the store is saved to with the word processor file and travels or associates with the particular document . A data binding may also contain information to control how the data should be transformed between the presentation the word processor s document surface for example and the data store . A user of the word processor application can allow the data stored in the data store the data that is manipulated by the backend applications to be stored in a standard format but present the same information in a word processor document in a friendlier format e.g. the user sees Jan. 29 2004 but the data is stored in dateTime format as 29 01 004T12 00 00.0000 . As another example the data binding information can contain an image to the data this image is represented as a seemingly meaningless string of characters but the same transformation principle described above means that the user will see an image in the content region of the word processor document . The user can add change the image and the XML encoded representation will be persisted to the XML data so that any backend process can store manipulate that information.

According to an embodiment when a user adds data binding information o a content region the user provides the linked XML data of interest identifying one or more nodes for example by specifying the XPath expression. Once bound the content of this content region will be linked or bound to the content XML data of the node returned by that XPath. Consequently this means that if an XML node is added removed changed in such a way that the XML node returned by the XPath changes then the content of the content region in the document updates automatically. Alternatively if a change occurs which results in no node being returned by a particular data binding then the data binding goes into a dangling reference state described below.

For example suppose a document includes the following paragraph where Microsoft Corporation corresponds to a plain text content region shown in italics bound to the XPath contract 1 header 1 company 1 in some linked XML data within the data store for that document. The paragraph displayed on the presentation is 

According to one embodiment a link can be set up by specifying a single line of code in a programming environment for example 

Suppose now that a user uses the data store API to add a new node as the first child of new node in single quotes 

The resulting binding on the content region is still bound to the same XPath contract 1 header 1 company 1 so the document content would immediately update to show the new contents of that node 

According to the invention if one or more regions of a word processor document contain data bound content regions the document reacts to changes to either source of the linked content. Accordingly if a range of the document is data bound then changing the contents of the XML node in the associated XML data will result in an automatic change to the text of the content region . Correspondingly if a range of the document is data bound then changing the text of that bound content region in the document results in an automatic change to the contents of the XML node in the corresponding XML data . That is multiple content regions with identical bindings may exist in multiple places in the document . For example a content region with a data binding to a name may be added to the header as well as the body of a document . Changing either of these locations synchronizes that text with the XML data store which will in turn reflect that change wherever a content region with a data binding to that node exists in the document .

An XML node in the XML data can have a one to many relationship with the document which means that the same XML node in the XML data can be referenced by multiple data bindings . Whenever the data bound content region in the document is updated it causes a change to the appropriate XML node in the XML data which in turn causes all other associated bindings in other content regions in the document to be updated with that new text. For example suppose a content region in the header of the document is contains a data binding specifying the XPath expression for a node in some XML data and another content region in the body of the document also contains a data binding to that same element. According to the invention both will display the same content even though they may have different formatting. If a user edits the content in the content region in the body of the document that update will be persisted to the appropriate XML node in the appropriate XML data in the data store causing all other content regions with associated bindings in the document e.g. in the header footer etc. which also specify that XML node to update. Embodiments of the invention provide a mechanism for binding multiple locations in the document to a single XML node in the data store now linking the content of all three of those locations to a single source of data. Accordingly the contents of all content regions in the document which are linked to the same node in the XML data are identical.

An illustrative example of this is a typical report document where the user might normally have the title displayed in several locations on the cover page in large bold text in the header in smaller text and in the footer in smaller italicized text . Normally the user would have to type out the title in each location ensuring that if the title is changed in any one of these three locations that they remember to change it in the other two to keep the content consistent . However it is all too easy to forget to keep all three of these locations in sync. According to an embodiment of the invention once a data store is in place that contains XML data that the user wants to display in the document multiple locations in the document e.g. the three locations discussed above can all be content regions data bound to a single XML node in the data store .

Thus the content of all three locations are linked or bound to a single source of data . This means that the user by changing the contents of any one of these regions e.g. the cover page will automatically cause the user s text to be pushed to the underlying XML data and then in turn pushed to the other locations in the document having content regions with corresponding data bindings in this case the header and the footer . This means that the user insofar as their interaction with the document has now linked or bound these three ranges of content so that they are all identical. According to the embodiments of the invention the regions of the document can be presented in multiple ways large and bold small and italicized etc. but the data structure in the data store remains the same.

According to an embodiment of the invention users can also specify XPath expressions that do not have a target their specified target XML node does not exist in the XML data in the data store . The data binding does not forget its desired target node rather it goes into a waiting state where it is not connected to any specific XML data but is waiting to see if the desired node appears in the XML data in the backing XML data store . This is particularly useful for document assembly scenarios where each part of a document for example a standard cover page end page and reused clauses may contain data bindings which should only be populated when these parts are assembled into a single final document . In this case the document creator specifies data bindings within content regions in each of the document parts to XML nodes in the XML data which did not exist in that part for example the cover page might contain a content region with a binding to a XML element and a XML element . When the part is viewed outside of its target document those bindings are not connected as no XML data exists but as soon as the part is added to a document which does contain the desired data the data bindings immediately connect synchronize to the data and display the correct content allowing the document creator to specify bindings and save them even though the data has not yet been generated.

One type of dangling reference occurs when a data binding on a content region cannot be successfully linked to a node in a linked XML stream i.e. a state of a binding in a content region . When a node is replaced removed from a linked XML stream one or more data bindings may become dangling references as a result. Preferably if a data binding has a dangling reference due to its XPath the word processor application continues to store the last known XPath for the node on the data binding . This can occur when the XPath no longer resolves to any node . Each time the data store messages an update of some XML data to the word processor document the word processor application checks if any dangling references are resolved by the latest update i.e. the XPath now points to a valid node in the XML tree . If the word processor application resolves a dangling reference the content of the data store preferably takes precedence over the content currently in the data binding that is the content of the data binding is replaced by the content in node in the data store . Dangling references are preferably exposed using a simple API layer accessible through one or more programming environments .

As an example suppose a word processor document includes the paragraph below where Microsoft Corporation corresponds to a plain text content region data bound to the XPath contract header company 3 in some XML data 

If a user such as a developer uses the data store s API to remove the first node under node in single quotes 

The resulting data binding on the content region in the document maintains a link to the same XPath so the data binding becomes a dangling reference to the now non existent contract header company 3 

This means that internally we have a broken link but in accordance with the invention the content of the content region does not change and no errors occur i.e. 

When some XML data is replaced or removed or when a link is moved from one document to another then all data bindings which reference that XML data immediately become dangling references pointing to the deleted XML data . If a data binding contains a dangling reference the word processor application continues to store the last known XPath namespace link associated with the data binding . According to an embodiment of the invention when a set of data bindings become dangling references the word processor application attempts to reattach these links to any other available XML data in the associated XML data store . If any of the data bindings do resolve to a node in another XML data then all of the dangling references associate to this XML data updating the associated content regions for which data bindings are now connected. If this XML data does not result in valid data bindings for any of the dangling references the word processor application performs a similar check with each XML data in the data store etc. If none of the XML data can be used for the dangling references then the bindings remain dangling references to the original XML data .

Referring to the flow diagram depicted in and with continuing reference to an embodiment of the invention is described. The process shown in begins at when a user opens a word processor document using a word processing application . At the word processing application creates a data store which is then in populated with any XML data stored in the word processor document or requested by using user interface or programming window . The data store is preferably included as part of the document but is not visible on the document editing surface . It will be appreciated that the data store may be loaded before creating the content regions and data bindings . Likewise the content regions can be created before the data store . In other words the various operations depicted in do not have to be carried out in any particular order and can be implemented according to a particular user s preference.

At the user creates one or more content regions which exist on the surface of the document . Note that these content regions can also be read from the existing contents of the document . At the user can associate data binding information with a content region by providing a particular linked XML data and an XPath expression specifying the target node . The one or more data bindings link one or more nodes of XML data in the data store to one or more content regions . The data binding becomes bound or dangling. As described above each node may be bound to a plurality of content regions each one specifying a data binding to the same XML node . Moreover the data bindings may be linked to multiple data stores . At the user may create XML data either in a content region or the date store . At the word processor application loads all XML data into a data store . At the word processor application loads the content regions from the document or as requested by the user and at the word processor application loads the data bindings from the document or as requested by the user . At the word processor application checks to see if the XML data associated with node specified by a particular data binding exists.

If the XML data does not exist at the word processor application determines whether other XML data exists within the same XML namespace. If the XML data is located within the data store at at the word processor application determines if the associated XML node for the specified XPath exists. If the XPath exists at the word processor application connects the various document content i.e. content regions and any other linked content to the associated XML node or nodes via the data binding. If the XPath is not located at the word processor application at labels the particular data binding as a dangling reference enters the dangling state . If at other XML data is found in the same XML namespace within the data store at the word processor application again checks to see if the XML node exists within that data.

If the XML data does not exist the word processor application labels the particular data binding as a dangling reference enters the dangling state at . If the XML data is found to exist at then at the word processor application searches for the desired XPath within that XML data . If the node is found at the word processor application connects the document content i.e. content regions and any other linked content to the associated XML node or nodes at .
