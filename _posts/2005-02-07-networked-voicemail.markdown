The disclosure herein relates generally to communication systems and more particularly to integrated communication and messaging systems.

As methods of communication continue to proliferate enterprises continue to desire integrated systems for handling all aspects of multi media communication for enterprise users. An enterprise can be any collection of users of communication media having some common purpose but a typical example is a company with one or more sites and some number of employees who are users of communication media. Communication media include electronic mail email messaging Short Messaging Service SMS messaging voice messaging and more. Users receive and send messages over a variety of wired and wireless networks via a variety of devices such as desktop computers wired phones wireless devices e.g. phones and personal digital assistants PDAs and more.

Enterprises currently have the ability to centralize and manage email messaging using commercially available groupware that centrally stores information about all of the users and their messages. Enterprises also have the ability to centrally manage traditional voice messaging using a Private Branch Exchange PBX . However the systems for managing email messaging and the systems for managing voice mail messaging are not at all well integrated. For example when a new user is added to the enterprise a system administrator for the enterprise sets up the user in the email system using the groupware application and its set methods data and protocols. In addition a different administrator specializing in telephony must set up the user in the voice messaging system using different methods data and protocols. Voice data and email data are typically stored in separate databases. Both initial user setup and updating user information are complicated by the fact that the email and voice systems are so distinct.

The management of and access to the voice mail message information and email information in the enterprise is also complicated by the current lack of integration of the two voice and email systems. There are various challenges to be overcome if one were to attempt to integrate the two systems.

All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

An embodiment of the invention is directed to allowing users in different organizations to exchange voicemail messages through electronic mail. The voicemail system stores voicemails as emails and uses a special format to store information about the voicemail. This format allows the user to access special voicemail features when the user accesses the email containing the voicemail. Under certain circumstances a user for example a user in company A may want to forward this email to an individual in another organization for example in company B. Ideally the user would want for the recipient in company B to also be able to access some of the special voicemail features associated with the email. However a standard email system may not support sending of the rich format of the email that was provided. Thus the user in company B would not be able to have the benefit of the special voicemail features associated with the email.

An embodiment of the invention is directed to helping the recipient in company B to access some of the special voicemail features associated with the email. When the user in company A sends the email to the recipient in company B the special voicemail formatting is encapsulated into a format that can be included in the email sent from company A to company B. When the email is received at company B the special voicemail formatting can be extracted. As a result the recipient in company B will be able to access some of the special voicemail features associated with the email. According to an embodiment of the invention the system in company A checks whether the recipient s system supports emails with the special voicemail formatting. If the recipient s system supports this kind of email the special voicemail formatting is encapsulated and sent in the email as described above and if the recipient s system does not support this kind of email the special formatting is not included with the email.

Each of system A system B system C and system D is coupled to Internet . The various systems include various components of communications and computer network systems. For example in system A private communications network system A voicemail system system A email system user A and user B are coupled together through one or several networks. Similarly the other systems shown include elements of voice and data communications networks. For example system B includes system B voicemail system coupled to system B email system and user C which is also coupled to system B email system . The various components of the systems shown in are coupled through Internet . The blocks shown in and other descriptions herein of the invention may be implemented as software hardware or combinations of software and hardware.

According to an embodiment of the invention system A system B system C and system D each represents communications systems of different organizations such as different companies. Users of these different systems of the various organizations would like to be able to exchange voicemail messages to others having similar equipment even though they are at different organizations. In the system voicemail messages may be stored as a rich format voicemail email. This may mean that the email containing the voicemail message has various particular features beyond those that are included in a standard email. This would allow a user for example to see certain special choices or buttons on the user interface that would allow the user to take certain actions that relate to voicemail messages such as playing forwarding or other unique voicemail actions. Such rich format voicemail email may not be supported by a typical email that is sent over the Internet such as an email that is sent over Internet . Thus a recipient on another organization s system may not be able to use some of the particular features of the voicemail system for the received email if the rich format is not retained. In order to allow for the rich format to be used on another system certain data from rich format voicemail email is encapsulated in encapsulation block . The result is email with encapsulated data .

Email with encapsulated data is passed to another email system such as system B email system . This email is received in system B email system as email with encapsulated data as shown in . The rich format of the email is extracted in extraction block . The result is a corresponding rich format voicemail email which corresponds to the rich format of rich format voicemail email from system A email system . Thus user C is able to view rich format voicemail email and experience some of the unique voicemail actions and particular features of the user interface that were available on system A email system to users such as user A or user B .

If system C is similarly enabled to extract and use the rich format of the email with encapsulated data a user on system C will similarly be able to experience the unique voicemail actions and particular features of the received email. However other systems not equipped with the requisite extraction logic and or voicemail system may not necessarily be able to display the rich format email or extract the rich format of the email and therefore not be able to provide the corresponding unique voicemail actions or particular features of the received email. System A email system may account for this by not encapsulating the data from the rich format voicemail email and instead by sending a simplified form of the email with the included voicemail audio data. For example if system D is not able to extract and use the rich format of the email according to an embodiment of the invention system A email system does not encapsulate the data from the rich format voicemail email and instead sends a simplified form of the email with the included voicemail audio data to system D .

The user requests to forward the rich format voicemail email to a recipient on a remote voicemail system for example to a recipient at a different organization with its own voicemail system. Such request may be made by an action on a user interface such as by a command in a voice interface or selection of a button on a graphical user interface. The rich format data is encapsulated block and packaged into the outgoing email block . The email with the encapsulated data is sent to the remote system which is a different communication system that is coupled to the intended recipient of the email block . The remote system extracts the rich format data from the received email block . The remote system then provides a rich format voicemail email from the received email and the extracted data block . The resulting rich format voicemail email is then displayed to the user that was the intended recipient of the email containing the voicemail block . The user is then able to experience some of the same unique voicemail actions and particular features that were available to the user sending the rich format voicemail email.

System A and System B are each part of various communications and computer network systems. System A email system and system B email system are coupled by way of Internet . User C is coupled to system B email system .

In the system a rich format voicemail email may be forwarded to a user on a different email system. So long as the email system from which the rich format voicemail email is forwarded and the email system to which the rich format voicemail email is forwarded both have the capability to recognize and use the particular format the rich format properties will be preserved. The rich format may mean that the email containing the voicemail message has various particular features beyond those that are available with a standard email which would allow the user for example to see certain special choices or buttons on the user interface that would allow the user to take certain actions that relate to voicemail messages such as playing forwarding or other unique voicemail actions or other voicemail properties.

In one embodiment of the invention Messaging Application Programming Interface MAPI is used as a method of preserving the rich format data contained in the rich format email by assigning MAPI properties to corresponding rich format data. MAPI is used by various industry standard email clients such as the Microsoft Exchange client. MAPI is a mechanism to access information in Exchange and enables different email systems to work together to distribute email. In Exchange email message properties are stored as MAPI properties which contain general email message properties including recipient sender email body and email subject and Exchange specific email message properties including unique identifiers for the sender each recipient and the message itself. However MAPI does not work well outside an intranet. Thus if the sending and receiving email systems utilize Exchange to handle emails and are each part of the same organization using one intranet all MAPI properties which preserve the rich format data of an email will be preserved by Exchange when sent from the sending system to the receiving system. However when the sending system is a member of one organization using one intranet and the receiving system is a member of a different organization not using the same intranet even if they both utilize Exchange to handle emails when the sending system sends the email to the receiving system Exchange may strip off the Exchange specific email message MAPI properties from the email. In this situation Exchange provides a simplified form of the email with only the general email message MAPI properties which may include voicemail audio data but none of the Exchange specific email message MAPI properties which include voicemail properties.

In an embodiment of the invention Exchange specific MAPI properties are assigned for each of the voicemail properties contained in rich format voicemail email resulting in voicemail properties being stored in MAPI format. If system A and system B are each part of the same organization using the same intranet that uses Exchange to handle emails the MAPI format is preserved when a user in system A sends rich format voicemail email to a user in system B . However if system B is part of a different organization not using the same intranet as system A Exchange may strip off the Exchange specific MAPI properties associated with voicemail properties .

Thus given that system A and system B are each part of a common network of voicemail systems rich format voicemail email containing the voicemail properties is encapsulated in block . System A email system uses a MAPI transport provider to convert MAPI properties into a Transport Neutral Encapsulated Format TNEF serial data stream. TNEF defines several TNEF specific attributes each of which corresponds to a particular MAPI property. These attributes are used to encode the corresponding MAPI properties into the TNEF serial data stream. TNEF is primarily used by transport providers that need to encode MAPI message properties for transmission through a messaging system that does not support those properties directly. Thus before an email containing MAPI properties is sent the MAPI transport provider converts the MAPI Properties into a TNEF data stream and encapsulates the TNEF data stream into a special attachment on the outgoing email using the underlying email system s attachment model. For example Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP based transport which is a protocol for sending email messages between email systems uses a MAPI transport provider to encode MAPI properties into a TNEF data stream. Exchange which is utilized by system A email system to handle email sends message which includes standard email attributes such as to and from fields and the TNEF data stream attachment as encapsulated data which is usually named winmail.dat. 

The received email which contains the encapsulated data and the standard email attributes is delivered to system B email system . Exchange which is utilized by system B email system to handle email uses the MAPI transport provider in extraction block and extracts the MAPI properties from the TNEF serial data stream contained in encapsulated data . Exchange recognizes the MAPI properties corresponding to rich format data. The result is a corresponding rich format voicemail email containing voicemail properties which corresponds to the rich format voicemail email containing voicemail properties from system A email system . As a result the users in the organizations associated with system A and system B may get the experience of having their voicemail systems networked.

Thus user C is able to view rich format voicemail email on computer system along with the voicemail properties in a similar manner as displayed in message . User C can then take certain actions that relate to voicemail messages such as playing forwarding or other unique voicemail actions by pressing the appropriate button displayed on the user interface. For example user C may play the voicemail message by pressing play button or forward the voicemail message by pressing the forward button . One feature supported by the voicemail system based on the special voicemail formatting may be that a voicemail email message can be played on the user s telephone. Thus user C may be able to play voicemail email message on telephone device using the special voicemail formatting in voicemail email .

Each of system A system B system C and system D is coupled to Internet . The various systems may or may not be members of a common network of voicemail systems. For example system A system B and system C have corresponding voicemail capabilities that allow for special voicemail features of inbound emails to be used. The various systems may contain various components of communications and computer network systems. For example system A includes system A email system .

In the system a rich format voicemail email such as rich format voicemail email may be forwarded to a user on a different email system such as a user coupled to system B a user coupled to system C or a user coupled to system D . When a user of system A email system forwards a rich format voicemail email before email is sent it is analyzed in routing block . Routing block will use network enabled lookup to determine if the recipient system is able to receive and use the special voicemail formatting of voicemail email .

If network enabled lookup determines the recipient network is a member of the common network of voicemail systems routing block causes dividing block to provide rich format voicemail email to be encapsulated in encapsulation block . If network enabled lookup determines the recipient network is not a member of the common network of voicemail systems routing block causes dividing block to provide rich format voicemail email to no encapsulation block and rich format voicemail email is not encapsulated. If rich format voicemail email is sent to encapsulation block the rich format data is encapsulated. The sent email block then sends the forwarded email whether or not the rich format data has been encapsulated to the recipient system.

If the recipient system is a member of the common network of voicemail systems to which system A is a member it will receive the forwarded email with encapsulated rich format data. If the recipient system is not a member of the common network of voicemail systems it will receive a simplified form of the email with the included voicemail audio data. For example given that system A system B and system C are all members of a common network of voicemail systems system B and system C receive the forwarded email with encapsulated rich format data. Given that system D is not a member of the common network of voicemail systems system D only receives a simplified version of the email. The email system corresponding to system B or system C as the case may be then extracts the encapsulated rich format data from the forwarded email and provides to its users a rich format voicemail email corresponding to the rich format voicemail email in system A email system .

Each of system A system B system C and registration service is coupled to Internet . The various systems may or may not include voice mail systems and may or may not be registered to be compatible with one another. For example system A and system B contain system A voicemail system and system B voicemail system respectively. Company A which uses system A and company B which uses system B may then be registered to receive and use emails in a format that preserves the rich format properties of the voicemail email but company C which uses system C is not registered as shown in entry chart . By registering company A and company B each becomes part of a virtual network.

Thus before a user from company A sends a rich format voicemail email to a user from company B and a user from company C network enabled lookup checks with database of registration service and since company B is registered routing block sends email containing the rich format data to the user from company B however since company C is not registered routing block sends email not containing the rich format data to the user from company C. Therefore the users from company A may forward rich format voicemail emails to users from company B and the company B users experience the voicemail properties in a similar manner experienced by the company A users. However since they are not part of the virtual network the company C users only receive a simplified form of the email with the included voicemail audio data delivered to system C email system .

Optionally system A may have local cache and the registration data corresponding to a remote system is stored locally on cache . Thus before a user from company A sends a rich format voicemail email to a user from a different company for example a user from company B network enabled lookup checks with database of registration service and stores company B s registration data in cache . Thereafter every time before a user from company A sends a rich format voicemail email to a user from company B network enabled lookup checks registration data from cache . Network enabled lookup may periodically check registration data in database for updates.

In one embodiment of the invention network enabled lookup uses a Domain Name System DNS lookup of the domain name recipient service SRV record. DNS translates domain names into Internet Protocol IP addresses and an SRV record provides information on available services for a given domain name. When an email system sends out an email it uses DNS to convert the domain name corresponding to the email address to an IP address. DNS also performs a lookup of the domain name and determines where to send the email based on the SRV record of the domain name. In such an embodiment of the invention the SRV record for a domain name of a system which is part of the virtual network will include some identification that the system is part of the virtual network. DNS also determines if the domain name is part of the virtual network. For example if a user from company A desires to forward a rich format voicemail email to a user on company B whose email address is user companyB.com before the voicemail email is sent network enabled lookup looks up companyB.com using a DNS lookup and given that company A and company B are members of the virtual network network enabled lookup finds that the SRV record of companyB.com contains an identification that companyB.com is part of the virtual network of voicemail systems. Given that company D is not a member of the virtual network of voicemail systems if a user from company A sends a rich format voicemail email to a user from company B the DNS lookup of company B s domain finds that the SRV record of companyD.com will not contain any identification that company D is a member of the virtual network.

In another embodiment of the invention a system administrator of system A system specifies which remote systems belong to the virtual network and stores such data in a database or file that may be located on optional cache or in a database outside system A . Network enabled lookup then checks compatibility of the recipient system against the database or file. In such an embodiment of the invention the system may not include registration service . Alternatively registration service may be used in combination with information maintained by the system administrator.

In another embodiment of the invention compatibility data normally stored in database which is located outside system A may be downloaded by system A email system and be stored in local cache . Network enabled lookup then checks compatibility of the recipient system against the downloaded data.

In another embodiment of the invention web services are used to check compatibility recipient system to receive the rich formatted voicemail. Such web services may be used as an alternative to the DNS lookup described herein. Embodiments of web services may include integration of Web based applications using the XML SOAP WSDL and UDDI open standards over an Internet protocol backbone. According to various embodiments XML is used to tag the data SOAP is used to transfer the data WSDL is used for describing the services available and UDDI is used for listing what services are available. According to an embodiment of the invention a service is used to check compatibility recipient system to receive the rich formatted voicemail such as web services which share business logic data and processes through a programmatic interface across a network.

The user desires to forward the rich format voicemail email to another individual on a recipient system. Prior to the email being forwarded lookup logic determines if the recipient system is a part of the common network of voicemail systems to which the sending system is a member block . If the recipient system is a member of the common network of voicemail systems then both systems are part of a virtual network.

In one embodiment of the invention the lookup logic uses a DNS lookup of the domain name SRV record. When an email system sends out an email DNS performs a lookup of the recipient domain name and determines where to send the email based on the SRV record of the domain name. In such an embodiment the SRV record for a domain name of a system which is part of the virtual network of voicemail systems will include some identification that the system is part of the virtual network. In the same manner DNS lookup allocates where to send the email within a domain name it will also determine if the domain name is part of the virtual network of voicemail systems.

In another embodiment of the invention the system administrator of the sending system specifies which recipient systems belong to the virtual network of voicemail systems and stores such data in a database or file that may be located on sending system local cache or in a database outside the sending system. The lookup logic would then check the virtual network status of the recipient system against the database or file.

In another embodiment of the invention virtual network status of recipient systems normally stored in a media outside the sending system may be downloaded by the email system of the sending system and be stored in local cache. The lookup logic checks virtual network status of the recipient system against the downloaded data.

If the receiving system is part of the virtual network of voicemail systems the rich format data is encapsulated block and packaged into the outgoing email. If the receiving system is not a member of the virtual network of voicemail systems the rich format data is not encapsulated and a simplified form of the email with the included voicemail audio data is queued for transmission.

The email whether or not the rich format data has been encapsulated is sent to recipient system block . Recipient systems that are part of the virtual network of voicemail systems extract the rich format data from the received email and provide a rich format voicemail email from the received email and the extracted data. The resulting rich format voicemail email is then displayed to the user that was the intended recipient of the rich format voicemail email. The user is then able to experience some of the same unique voicemail actions and particular features of the user interface that were available to the user sending the rich format voicemail email. Recipient systems that are not part of the virtual network of voicemail systems only receive the simplified form of the email with the included voicemail audio data.

The following is a non exhaustive description of various embodiments of systems and methods with which the methods and systems described above may be combined. For example the systems and methods described above for networking of voicemail systems may be employed in combination with the form based interface for use in retrieving voice mail messages and controlling actions taken on voice mail messages received in an enterprise network system. Thus according to an embodiment a rich format email is used to allow a user to use a form based interface even when the email is sent over a network to a different system.

Integrated multi media communication systems and methods are provided below. These communication systems and methods collectively referred to herein as integrated communication systems or ICS integrate different types of messaging so that a user of the ICS can access multiple types of messages e.g. voice mail messages electronic mail email messages instant messaging messages SMS Short Messaging System messages MMS Multimedia Messaging System messages etc. with a single message interface. In providing integrated messaging functionality via a single message interface the ICS of an embodiment relieves the dependency of a voice mail system for example by providing users with access to voice mail messages and capabilities of the voice mail system through the local groupware applications and email messaging system.

The ICS generally includes a communication server a cache system and an interface module. The ICS integrates with a messaging and collaboration system and the corresponding groupware applications in a network environment for example. In providing integrated messaging capabilities the communication server and interface module function to route a call received from a caller to a user and in the event the user is not available to receive and route a voice mail message left by the caller. The ICS uses caching processes during the receiving and routing of voice mail messages that provide users with fast access to voice mail messages user information and contact information. Using caching process the ICS also provides access to the voice mail messaging system during periods when the messaging and collaboration system is offline. The ICS also leverages the storage capability of the messaging and collaboration system to eliminate the need for a separate voice mail database.

The message interface of the ICS includes a form based interface for use in retrieving voice mail messages and controlling actions taken on voice mail messages received in the enterprise network system. This form based interface enables a user to retrieve and take various actions on voice mail messages using data of a form provided to the user s client device by the enterprise network email system. Use of the form based interface thus provides users with access to the integrated messaging functions offered by the ICS without a requirement to install or run a dedicated client application on the user s client device.

In the following description numerous specific details are introduced to provide a thorough understanding of and enabling description for embodiments of the ICS. One skilled in the relevant art however will recognize that these embodiments can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other components systems etc. In other instances well known structures or operations are not shown or are not described in detail to avoid obscuring aspects of the disclosed embodiments.

IM X of ICS X couples to transfer information or data with communication server X. Additionally IM X couples to transfer information with one or more components of a messaging server X where transferring information includes one or more of pulling receiving retrieving polling transmitting and pushing operations to name a few. As an example of an information transfer between IM X and messaging server X IM X pulls user information from messaging server X and makes the pulled user information available to other components of ICS X wherein the user information includes information relevant to at least network X.

The components of messaging server X may include for example one or more processors X also referred to as central processing units or CPUs and one or more databases X coupled to CPU X. In an embodiment IM X may be hosted on or running under control of messaging server X but is not limited to this configuration. Further messaging server X may be a component of network X that hosts communication server X but is not so limited. For example messaging server X may be hosting a groupware application e.g. Microsoft Exchange LotusNotes etc. of an enterprise network X.

Cache X couples to communication server X and communicates to transfer information with one or more of communication server X IM X and one or more components of messaging server X as described below. Cache X may also couple to additional components not shown of network X.

As an example of information transfers between cache X and communication server X cache X may receive caller information e.g. voice mail messages caller identification etc. from client devices X via communication server X. An example of information transfers between cache X and messaging server X includes transfers in which cache X receives user information from messaging server X where the user information may be routed from messaging server X via IM X and or communication server X. Another example of information transfers between cache X and messaging server X includes transfers in which messaging server X receives information from cache X routed from cache X via communication server X and or IM X.

Examples of information transfers between cache X and IM X include transfers of user information pulled from messaging server X by IM X and directed to cache X and transfers in which IM X directs a message from at least one of messaging server X and cache X to at least one device on networks X and X using the user information. Cache X holds or temporarily stores the received information under the above examples.

Networks X and X include various network components not shown of one or more communication service providers or carriers but are not so limited. Further networks X and X and corresponding network components can be any of a number combination of network types known in the art for providing communications among coupled devices X and X including but not limited to proprietary networks local area networks LANs metropolitan area networks MANs wide area networks WANs backend networks public switched telephone networks PSTN the Internet and other public networks for example. Additionally networks X and X may include hybrid networks that use a proprietary network for some portion of the communications routing for example while using one or more different public networks for other portions of the communications routing.

Client devices X and X include communication devices like telephones cellular telephones and radio telephones. Client devices X and X also include processor based devices like for example portable computers PC portable computing devices personal digital assistants PDA communication devices cellular telephones portable telephones portable communication devices and user devices or units. Client devices can include so called multi modal devices where the user can interact with the device and or the ICS through any form of input and output such as text input speech recognition text output text to speech graphics recorded files and video. In such devices the speech recognition and text to speech generation may partly take place in the device and partly in the ICS. Sound and or video may be generated by the ICS by a continuous stream of sound and or video data sent to the device. Client devices can include all such devices and equivalents and are not limited to any particular type of communication and or processor based device. In an embodiment client devices X are client devices operating in a private network environment like an enterprise network while client devices X are client devices operating in different private network environments or under any number of public networks.

Continuing processes X include pulling user information from a messaging server coupled to the ICS at block X as described above. The user information includes information relevant to users of at least the network hosting the ICS but is not so limited. Processes X also include caching pulled user information from the messaging server at block X. Additionally processes X include use of the user information of the cache to direct a message from at least one of the messaging server and the cache to one or more client devices on any of the networks at block X.

The ICS of an embodiment integrates different types of messaging so that a user of the ICS can access all of the message types e.g. voice mail messages electronic mail or email messages etc. with a single message interface also referred to as a user interface or UI . In providing integrated messaging functionality via a single message interface the ICS of an embodiment relieves the dependency on a voice mail system with a dedicated voicemail and user database for example by providing users with access to voice mail messages and capabilities of the voice mail system through the local email messaging system.

Components of ICS X include a communication server and an interface not shown . The interface of ICS X may run under control of messaging server X as described above but is not so limited. Information flow X begins when in response to receiving data streams from networks X of different types ICS X generates a first message X and transfers first message X to messaging server X via a communication with messaging server X. First message X may be a voice mail message Voice Mail Type or VMT but is not limited to this type of message. For purposes of the description herein a voice mail message is left by a caller to the ICS. For example in an embodiment where Microsoft Exchange is the messaging server X the VMT may be implemented using Message Class and or Message Type fields associated with messages in Microsoft Exchange.

Following or simultaneous with receipt of first message X the messaging server X detects or identifies a type of first message X using information of the first message and generates a second message X. Second message X is of a different type from that of first message X and includes information of first message X. Second message X may for example be an email message but is not limited to this type of message. Second message X is transferred to a client device X via a communication with client device X where the communication uses a communication protocol of network X.

Responsive to receipt of second message X client device X determines a type of the second message and requests form data X that corresponds to second message X. Messaging server X in response to the request for form data X transfers form data to client device X via the second coupling. One or more components of ICS X generate and or provide form data X for storage in messaging server X and form data X is generated under the communication infrastructure of network X. The form data may be displayed to the user using the corresponding form.

Client device X uses form data X to view contents of second message X. The client device also uses form data X to establish communications with communication server X of ICS X via a third coupling. The communication protocol of the third coupling is different than the communication protocol of the second coupling but is not so limited. An embedded control controls activation of the third coupling. Furthermore the client device allows a user using the client device to direct actions X on first message X via the third coupling with the ICS using the form data. For purposes of the description herein a user is an individual with enabled capability to use functions within the ICS.

As an example under information flows X is a flow diagram for integrated communication processes X using ICS X under an embodiment. Processes X include transferring a first message to a messaging server from a communication server via a first coupling at block X. Processes X also include generating a second message at the messaging server in response to a type of the first message and transferring the second message to a client device via a second coupling at block X. The second message may be of a different type than the first message and includes data of the first message. Processes X further include transferring to the client device form data that corresponds to the first message at block X. Additionally processes X include establishing a third coupling between the client device and the communication server using the form data at block X. Moreover processes X include directing actions on the first message from the client device using the form data the actions directed via the third coupling at block X.

The ICS of an embodiment integrates messages of different types to enable a user to access a number of message types through components of the ICS. Thus an application of the ICS of an embodiment is as a substitute for a voice mail system in an enterprise network where the ICS enables a user to receive and or take action on voice mail messages using the enterprise email system.

Communication server X couples to any number of client devices X external to enterprise network X via one or more networks not shown as described above with reference to . Similarly communication server X couples to any number of client devices X local to enterprise network X.

Communication server X includes an operating system X as well as numerous components or subsystems. These components include but are not limited to one or more Voice Applications X an Execution Engine X and any number of Mobile Application Modules X as described below or any other type of application module.

The MCS of an embodiment includes an Operating System along with an Execution Engine some number of Voice Applications and some number of Mobile Applications. The Operating System includes for example a Linux kernel with a journaling file system that provides integrity of file system tables and the data structure. The storage on the MCS may be configured as a RAID Redundant Array of Independent Disks configuration to provide high reliability access to software and data. The Operating System supports operations of numerous other components of the MCS as described below.

With regard to the Operating System the MCS includes a Telephony Interface that couples calls and connects callers and users to from the MCS. The Telephony Interface couples call information to from a private branch exchange PBX not shown for example where the PBX is a component of enterprise network system X. The Telephony Interface couples to the PBX using a variety of telephony integrations that include one or more of analog Simplified Message Desk Interface SMDI T1 E1 Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP and Digital Set Emulation DSE signals but may couple using other signals signaling protocols. When receiving a call from the PBX for example the MCS receives data of an incoming call from the PBX where the data includes called party information a reason for transfer of call e.g. called party line busy no answer by called party called party using call forwarding etc. and calling parting information caller ID etc. .

A Driver couples information received at the Telephony Interface to the Telephony Services component of the MCS. The Driver may perform low level signaling and or data conversion as appropriate to the received signals. The Telephony Services include one or more components for use in processing the received signals. These components include for example voice processing switching control and PBX signaling but are not limited to these components.

The MCS of an embodiment includes at least one Voice Browser that when the MCS receives a call receives voice information of the call. The Voice Browser controls the use of automatic speech recognition ASR for speech recognition and DTMF recognition. The Voice Browser of an embodiment couples to a cache or other temporary store that holds voice recordings and or name grammars Voice Recordings Grammars the name grammars are cached after being generated from names in a user list as described below . The ASR may use information of the name grammars. Further the Voice Browser controls the use of text to speech TTS as well as the play of any number of pre recorded prompts e.g. WAVE format files . The Voice Browser uses voice extensible markup language VXML but is not limited to this protocol. Alternative embodiments of the MCS may not include the Voice Browser. As an alternative to a Voice Browser the MCS may directly communicate with or use other software or processes for communication between the voice application and the Telephony Services and or Driver.

The Virtual Machine Voice Applications and Execution Engine form a hierarchical state machine framework in which the Virtual Machine runs a number of APIs and modules. Consequently the Voice Applications can include one component controlling the user interfaces UI to the MCS and another component handling lower level communications with the modules. Use of a loose coupling between the modules and the Voice Browser provided by the state machine framework allows independence between the languages used in the different modules and the Voice Browser. The state machine framework may receive hypertext transport protocol HTTP requests from the Voice Browser for example and generate VXML or Speech Application Language Tags SALT SALT extends existing mark up languages such as hypertext markup language HTML extensible hypertext markup language XHTML and extensible markup language XML and enables multimodal and telephony enabled access to information applications and web services from devices like PCs telephones and PDAs for example .

The Voice Applications of an embodiment include a number of components including an automatic attendant a caller interface a user interface and a system main menu but may include other types of voice applications. The automatic attendant is speech enabled but may be dual tone multi frequency DTMF enabled. The automatic attendant which can be enabled or disabled uses information of contact lists e.g. User List in the Cache.

The Voice Applications also include at least one voice mail application. The voice mail application uses information of the Cache e.g. User List Global Address List Public Folders Personal Contact Folders in operations that include sending a new voice mail and or forwarding a received voice mail. The voice mail application also uses Cache information in support of voice mail networking in which voice mails and corresponding information are exchanged with groupware applications of enterprise network system X as described below.

The voice mail application couples to the MCS state machine framework described above via one or more application programming interfaces API . The APIs handle the different data formats types in use by enterprise network system X e.g. greeting data PIN Personal Identification Number code data voice mail message data system parameters etc. . Similarly the Cache also couples to the state machine framework where the Cache includes one or more of local cache and distributed cache. Therefore communications among the voice mail application the Cache and the MSERV take place via the state machine framework and the APIs as appropriate to the state e.g. offline online of the MSERV.

In addition to the Voice Applications the modules running under the Virtual Machine of an embodiment include Mobile Applications. The Mobile Applications provide access to user information via mobile devices where the access may include transferring information of email calendar and or contacts to a user s mobile client device via an electronic message e.g. SMS MMS and or pager .

The MCS also includes an Administration Configuration manager. The Administration Configuration manager provides access to and control of a unified configuration file of the MCS. The Administration Configuration manager uses information of the unified configuration file to provide separate Configuration Files to one or more of the components of the MCS as appropriate. The unified configuration file can be copied from the MCS and stored for backup purposes. Additionally a predefined configuration file may be uploaded to the MCS to provide the appropriate configuration for the MCS. A browser interface to the Administration Configuration manager allows remote access to the MCS.

The MCS also includes a Self Maintenance Supervisor or reliability server that monitors MCS components and restarts failed processes when necessary for example. In addition the MCS also includes Security Restrictions for use in controlling MCS port security.

As described above the MCS of an embodiment interfaces with the MSERV via the IM. The MCS communicates with the IM via the Groupware Connector for example but is not so limited. The Groupware Connector of an embodiment includes a Web Server but is not so limited. The MSERV functions as a messaging and collaboration server. The IM is an interface that runs under the MSERV in one embodiment to provide communications and information transfers between components of the MCS and components of the MSERV. In other embodiments the IM may run under control of the MCS for example. The IM includes and or couples with Management Console X as well as with a diagnostics component Diagnostics Component and or a run time component RTC not shown .

Management Console X supports access to the MCS by a system administrator of enterprise network system X for purposes of managing user access. Consequently Management Console X allows a system administrator to enable new users with integrated messaging functionality of the ICS and administer and monitor one or more MCSs.

The Diagnostics Component of the IM supports on the fly diagnostics gathering computing and or compiling of pre specified diagnostics information or parameters from the MSERV. In this manner the MCS may provide diagnostics information and a user may provide dynamically updateable diagnostics information.

The RTC translates communications between components of the MCS and components of the MSERV. As an example the RTC may be used to retrieve user information from the directory service e.g. Active Directory of a groupware application in response to a request from the MCS as described below. Communications between the RTC and components of the MCS use for example XML and Web Services. Communications between the RTC and the MSERV may use one or more APIs of the MSERV e.g. MAPI Collaboration Data Objects CDO Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning WebDAV etc. .

The MSERV of an embodiment represents a messaging and collaboration server. The messaging and collaboration server includes a groupware application that runs on one or more servers and enables users via local client devices to send and or receive electronic mail and other forms of interactive communication through computer networks. The MCS of an embodiment interoperates with groupware applications that include but are not limited to Microsoft Exchange Server but alternative embodiments may use other types of messaging and collaboration servers. Therefore the MCS of an embodiment interoperates with client device applications client applications such as Microsoft Outlook as well as with other email client applications e.g. Microsoft Outlook Express .

The MSERV sends and receives email messages through what is commonly referred to as a client device such as a personal computer workstation or a mobile device including mobile phones or PDAs. The client device typically connects to the LAN which may include any number and or combination of servers or mainframe computers where the email mailboxes and public folders are stored. The centralized servers connect to numerous other types of networks e.g. private or proprietary and the Internet to transmit and receive email messages to other email users. Consequently the MCS uses the MSERV for storing and forwarding email messages in an embodiment.

The MSERV also couples to a directory service not shown which is a database of information on each user account in the enterprise network system. Access to the directory service may use for example a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol LDAP .

With regard to client device access functionality the MSERV provides integrated collaborative messaging features such as scheduling contact and task management capabilities. As an example MSERV configuration when the MSERV is Microsoft Exchange the MSERV runs on a version of the Microsoft Windows Server operating system. A version of Microsoft Office Outlook runs on Windows based local client devices and communicates with the MSERV through the messaging application programming interface MAPI protocol. The MSERV also accommodates other client device access by supporting one or more of Post Office Protocol 3 POP3 and Internet Message Access Protocol 4 IMAP4 protocols as well as support for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP . Using this same MSERV configuration example the MCS of an embodiment along with Microsoft Outlook Web Access a service in Microsoft Exchange accommodates web browser based access clients also referred to as thin clients.

The MSERV collaboration features support information sharing among users. Collaborative scenarios include maintaining shared address lists that all users can view and edit scheduling meetings that include people and conference rooms by viewing associated free or busy schedules the ability to grant other people such as administrators access to user mailboxes on behalf of the user.

As described above the IM serves as an interface for the transfer of information between components of the MCS and components of the MSERV. Transferring information includes for example pulling receiving retrieving polling transmitting and pushing operations to name a few. As an example of information transfers between the MCS and the MSERV the IM pulls information from one or more components of the MSERV and makes the pulled information available to for example the MCS Cache. The IM also pushes information from one or more components of the MCS to the MSERV.

In serving as an interface between the MCS and the MSERV the components of the IM e.g. RTC translate communications between components of the MCS e.g. Virtual Machine Cache etc. and components of the MSERV environment. As an example the IM retrieves user information from components of the directory service e.g. Active Directory in response to a request from the MCS Cache.

Embodiments of the IM may include one or more of the following components an RTC a Management Console a desktop component messaging actions control component Diagnostics Component and or a message waiting indication component. The desktop component allows the user to configure aspects of the user s integrated messaging account such as voice message greetings extended absence greeting PIN code data and presence information. The messaging actions control component receives and responds to user generated requests from the FBUI defined herein to take actions such as playing replaying to and forwarding voice messages as well as calling the sender of a voice mail message. The message waiting indication component receives events from the user s message inbox folder and requests corresponding action from the PBX or other aspect of the telephony system such turning on message waiting indicators on the user s device s . The message waiting indication component may send notifications by way of SMS MMS and or pager.

Directory service X provides a location for storage of information about network based entities such as applications files and printers to name a few. Directory service X also stores information about individuals also referred to as users and this information is referred to herein as User Information. As such directory service X provides a consistent way to name describe locate access manage and secure information about individual resources in an enterprise network environment. Directory service X uses the stored information to act as the main switchboard of the enterprise network operating system and is therefore the central authority that manages the identities and brokers the relationships between distributed resources of the enterprise network thus enabling the resources to work together. Directory service X of an embodiment may be Microsoft Active Directory AD but is not so limited.

In embodiments including AD there is a user object stored in an AD Database for each enterprise user. For example the user object for enterprise USER is shown as USER object X. The user object includes many fixed attributes such as user name user phone number user mailbox location and user email address.

The user object further includes a number of Custom Attributes. The number of Custom Attributes is small for example fifteen compared to the number of fixed attributes. The Custom Attributes are usable to store information not provided for in the predefined fixed attributes. In one embodiment a Custom Attribute stores user specific data that is used by the Voice Applications. Examples of such user specific data include a class of service COS for the user a voice mail extension for the user whether voice mail is enabled for the user etc. The data is stored as a data stream in the Custom Attribute with a maximum size of 2048 bytes. In an alternative embodiment the user specific data that is used by the Voice Applications is stored as individual data items in fixed attributes by extending AD in a known manner.

The user mailbox location fixed attribute indicates where the user s email mailbox is stored in the enterprise. In some large enterprises there may be many MSERVs each including a database storing many user mailboxes. As shown the mailbox location fixed attribute points to USER mailbox X on an MSERV called MSERV .

User mailbox X stores email messages sent to the user as well as outgoing messages and other items for predetermined periods of time. In an embodiment the messages can be of at least two types one of which is a normal message that is routinely accessible by the user. Another message type is a hidden message that is not routinely accessible by the user through the normal user email interfaces. In an embodiment a hidden message is used to store data used by the Voice Applications. In contrast to the data stored in the Custom Attribute however the data stored in the hidden message can be much larger than the 2048 byte limit of the custom attribute. In one embodiment among the data stored in the hidden message are audio files stored as attachments to the hidden message such as a busy greeting for the user s voice mail mailbox a no answer greeting for the user s voice mail mailbox and a recorded name for the user s voice mail mailbox.

An example of the MCS accessing the MSERV environment X through IM X is a phone caller calling the voice mail mailbox of USER when USER is on the phone. The MCS transmits an action via IM X with a request to play busy greeting. The transmission includes information to access the USER object X fixed attributes to determine the user s email mailbox location. In addition the transmission includes information to access the USER object X Custom Attribute and to transfer the contents of the Custom Attribute to the MCS via IM X. When the user s email mailbox is accessed the hidden message is opened to transfer the appropriate audio file busy greeting in this case to the MCS for playing over the phone to the caller. In many cases it may not be necessary to transfer either the Custom Attribute or the audio file from the MSERV environment X because the current custom attributes and audio file are cached on the MCS.

As described above operations of the Voice Applications and the Virtual Machine couple the Cache and other components of the MCS to components of the MSERV via the IM. As such the MCS and the IM support the transfer of information between the Cache and backend network components like the MSERV and the database. This configuration provides transparency between the Voice Applications and data stored in the database when using information of the database to support voice mail messaging functions of the MCS as described below.

The information transfers between the Cache and the MSERV along with use of the Custom Attributes and Hidden Messages as described above allow the ICS to overcome the need for an external database to store information stored by a typical voice mail system. This is because the information used by the MCS in providing voice mail message capabilities integrated with the email messaging capabilities of the enterprise network is pulled by the MCS from the MSERV via the IM. The pulling or retrieving may be performed periodically continually on demand and or in response to particular events e.g. update of the information in the MSERV but is not so limited. The information pulled by the MCS includes information of a Global Address List GAL information of one or more Public Folders Personal Contacts and information of a User List. 

The GAL includes information of all users in the enterprise network having access privileges that include the use of email. Public Folders include information of the network enterprise e.g. contacts calendars etc. that are shared with all users. The Personal Contacts include contact information for each user.

The User List includes User Information for a subset of users in the GAL each of whom has access privileged that include the use of the ICS. The User List therefore is a subset of the GAL and is retrieved and or cached as a separate list or stream in order to improve efficiency of communications and minimize the delays associated with having the MCS search the entire contents of the GAL for information used in executing a user requested action on a voice mail message. The User List of an embodiment includes one or more of the following parameters corresponding to each user but is not limited to these parameters Site identification mail box number pronounceable name office telephone extension COS automatic attendant state e.g. enabled disabled voice mail state e.g. enabled disabled Voice User Interface VUI state e.g. enabled disabled mobile access state e.g. enabled disabled bad logins locked out attendant destination force change of PIN code mobile gateway identification full name first name last name user name home telephone number office telephone number cellular telephone number identification email address department active greeting state time and date announcement voice mail notification state e.g. enabled disabled mail box status PIN code in encrypted or raw form no answer greeting busy greeting extended absence greeting recorded name and system greeting.

Instead of storing the information pulled from the MSERV in a separate voice mail database as would be done in a typical voice mail system the pulled information is pushed by the IM to the MCS and held in the Cache. The MCS uses the pulled information in subsequent voice mail message manipulation operations as described below. This pulling and caching of information by the MCS improves the speed and efficiency of voice mail message operations and prevents unnecessary loads on the MSERV resulting from the nearly continuous stream of read requests to the MSERV database in typical messaging systems.

The pulling of information from the MSERV by the MCS includes pulling and caching of information including the GAL Public Folder and User List. The pulled information is cached by the MCS on a system or non individual basis because this information applies throughout the enterprise. This information is pulled and cached periodically for example at 24 hour intervals e.g. each morning at 2 00 am or may be loaded on demand but is not so limited.

In contrast the MCS pulls and caches information of the Personal Contacts on a per user basis because this information is different for each user. The Personal Contacts may be requested and cached by the MCS periodically or on demand e.g. at the time a user logs in to the ICS in response to modifications of the Personal Contacts etc. .

In operating to provide integrated messaging capabilities the MCS and the IM function to route a call placed by a caller to a user and in the event the user is not available to receive and route a voice mail message left by the caller. The MCS and the IM also function to provide a user with access to voice mail messages using the messaging server of the enterprise email system. The voice mail access supports both online and offline modes of the messaging server.

An example of call routing by the MCS and with further reference to the MCS receives and detects a call at the Telephony Interface. Data of the call e.g. called party information calling party information reason for call transfer etc. invokes the Voice Browser. The Voice Browser transfers a request to the Voice Applications in response to the call data.

A Dispatcher component of the Voice Applications routes the call to one or more other Voice Application components in accordance with information of the User List. As an example the Dispatcher identifies the target user for the call and determines whether the target user s automatic attendant is enabled. If the automatic attendant is enabled then the automatic attendant receives the call request and provides the caller with one or more call routing options e.g. caller selects call routing by selecting and or saying extension number selecting and or saying name etc. and routes the call according to the caller s input.

As an example one or more of the Voice Applications determine an active greeting currently designated by the user for use in responding to calls e.g. system greeting no answer greeting busy greeting extended absence greeting etc. and retrieve the designated active greeting from one of the Cache or MSERV as appropriate to a state of the MSERV. The respective application s play the greeting activate a record mode to record the voice mail message of the caller and provide the caller with additional options available for call and or message routing e.g. message marking options message delivery options send message route message to additional users etc. . Upon completion of the recording and or selection of a message routing option by the caller the respective application s terminate the call hangs up and transfer the recorded voice mail message to one or more locations in the Cache and or MSERV e.g. a mail box that correspond to the user as described below with reference to X and X. Alternatively the voice mail message may be transferred before the application terminates the call.

As referenced above the MCS of an embodiment in conjunction with the IM supports availability of and access to the voice mail applications when the MSERV is both online and offline through the use of the Cache. The MCS of an embodiment includes an Offline Detector that monitors an availability state of the MSERV and detects unavailability offline condition or offline state of the MSERV. Upon detecting MSERV unavailability the MCS transitions to a mode that supports voice mail message recording and retrieval during the MSERV offline condition.

Caching of select information received and or generated in the MCS including User Information and voice mail information enhances performance of the enterprise network voice messaging system by reducing the instances of data retrieval from the MSERV. Further caching of select information improves the reliability of the enterprise network voice messaging system by allowing access to the voice messaging system during periods when the MSERV is offline.

Information received at the MCS is routed and held in the Cache in accordance with policies running in the state machine framework and or the availability state of the MSERV. Examples of information held in the Cache include but are not limited to the User List Global Address List information of Public Folders information of Personal Contact Folders voice mail message information both the text description portion and the audio message portion of the voice mail message greetings and other user parameters permissions and personal information of users e.g. PIN codes .

Regarding actions taken by the MCS following receiving and recording of a voice mail message when the MSERV is online the MCS generally holds information of the recorded message in the Cache. The MCS may also transfer the recorded voice mail message via the IM to the MSERV where it is stored in the Database.

As an example is an information flow X for routing and accessing voice mail messages via the ICS when the MSERV is in an online state under an embodiment. This information flow X shows one MCS and one MSERV in an enterprise network environment but this is shown only as an example and does not limit the network environment to the types numbers and or coupling of components shown as alternative embodiments may have any number of MCSs and or MSERVs.

Information flow X begins when a caller places a call X to a user and availability of the user results in the caller leaving a voice mail message referred to herein as the VMSG for the user. The voice mail message VMSG is received at the MCS and routed C X to the Cache where it is assigned an identification referred to herein as the CACHEID and held. The voice mail message VMSG may be held in the Cache for a pre specified period of time but the embodiment is not so limited. The voice mail message VMSG and the CACHEID are also routed M X to the MSERV via the IM as described above. The MSERV assigns an identification referred to herein as the VMSGID to the incoming voice mail message VMSG and stores X the voice mail message VMSG along with the VMSGID and CACHEID in one or more areas of memory not shown available to the MSERV. Memory may include any various form of storage or computer readable memories such as but not limited to volatile memory random access memory RAM non volatile memory read only memory ROM EEPROM disk and or other storage devices that may include one or more of magnetic and optical storage media.

As described above the MCS pulls information e.g. periodically on demand etc. from the MSERV via the IM and uses the pulled information in providing voice mail message capabilities integrated with email messaging capabilities of the enterprise network. Therefore pulling operations by the IM include pulling of information identifying the stored voice mail message VMSG where the information identifying the voice mail message VMSG includes but is not limited to the CACHEID. Upon request from the MCS the IM may pull X a voice mail list referred to herein as a VMLIST X which includes CACHEIDs and VMSGIDs for any stored messages from the MSERV environment. The IM pushes X VMLIST X to the MCS where it is held. VMLIST X may be generated from the user s inbox upon each request from the IM or may be stored and maintained in the MSERV or in the cache as a current representation of the contents of a user s voice mailbox or inbox. If and when a time period for holding a VMSG in the Cache expires the VMSG is still identifiable from VMLIST and can be found in the MSERV if requested using the VMSGID.

Information flow X continues when a user accesses X the enterprise network system to retrieve his her voice mail messages. In an embodiment the user access X causes the VMLIST to be pulled X from the MSERV and pushed X by the IM to the Cache and also or alternatively to the MCS Upon being provided with access to the MCS the user selects one or many voice mail message s by selecting a VMSGID CACHEID item from the VMLIST. In response to the user selection MCS searches X the Cache for a message using the Cache identification CACHEID of the selected message. In a scenario in which the message was left by the caller and the time period for holding the message VMSG in the Cache has not expired the MCS will locate the CACHEID and the message contents VMSG in the Cache. Once located through use of the CACHEID the MCS retrieves R X the voice mail message contents VMSG from the Cache and plays the voice mail message for the user as appropriate to the action selected by the user.

In this manner the MCS provides user access to the contents of the voice mail message VMSG via a mapping and without storing voice mail message contents in the MCS. The mapping includes a mapping of voice mail message contents to identification information of the email environment MSERV environment and mapping identification information of the email environment to identification information of the voice mail environment MCS . In this embodiment therefore the mapping includes mapping of voice mail message contents to the message identification VMSGID and mapping of the message identification VMSGID of the email environment to the MCS identification CACHEID.

As used herein pushing data or information indicates an action of a component or entity that has the affect of transferring the data or information to another component or entity. Transferring includes sending in response to a request query or command and sending on the initiative of the transferring component or entity. The transfer may be an internetwork transfer an intranetwork transfer or a transfer between a network component or entity and a non network component or entity.

As used herein pulling data or information indicates a component or entity receiving transferred data or information. Receiving includes receiving in response to a request query or command and retrieving in response to a request query or command. The transfer may be an inter network transfer an intra network transfer or a transfer between a network component or entity and a non network component or entity.

Information flow X begins when a caller places a call X to a user and availability of the user results in the caller leaving a voice mail message VMSG for the user. The voice mail message VMSG is received at the MCS and routed C X to the cache as described above and the VMSG and CACHEID is routed X to the MSERV via the IM also as described above. The MSERV assigns identification VMSGID to the incoming voice mail message VMSG and stores X the voice mail message VMSG along with the VMSGID in one or more areas of memory not shown available to the MSERV.

Information flow X continues when a user accesses X the enterprise network system to retrieve his her voice mail messages. VMLIST X is pulled X from the MSERV and pushed X by the IM to the MCS. Upon being provided with access to the MCS the user selects a voice mail message from VMLIST X by selecting a CACHEID VMSGID item. The MCS searches X the Cache for the Cache identification CACHEID of the selected message in response to the user selection. Because the message was left by the caller and stored in the MSERV environment and expired in the cache before the user calls in the MCS will not locate the CACHEID in the Cache. Consequently the MCS accesses the MSERV identifies the message VMSG and pulls R X the voice mail message contents from the MSERV environment via the IM. The MCS plays the pulled voice mail message VMSG for the user as appropriate to the action selected by the user.

In addition to the online scenarios described above the MCS of an embodiment provides offline behavior that allows for holding storing and retrieving voice mail messages when the MSERV is offline or unavailable for some reason or during times when the connection between the MCS and the MSERV is unreliable. Offline behavior means absence of a coupling between the MSERV and the MCS. Regarding actions taken by the MCS following recording of a voice mail message when the MSERV is offline a component of the MCS e.g. Offline Detector detects the MSERV is offline. The MCS holds the recorded voice mail message in the in response to detecting the MSERV state as offline. At such time as the MCS detects the MSERV is online the Groupware Connector pulls the voice mail message from the Cache and transfers the recorded voice mail message via the IM to the MSERV where it is stored in the Database.

As an example is an information flow X for routing and accessing voice mail messages via the ICS when the MSERV is in an offline state under an embodiment. This information flow X shows one MCS and one MSERV in an enterprise network environment but this is shown only as an example and does not limit the network environment to these components as alternative embodiments may have any number of MCSs and or MSERVs.

The information flow X begins when a caller places a call X to a user and availability of the user results in the caller leaving a voice mail message VMSG for the user. The voice mail message VMSG is received at the MCS however a component of the MCS detects an unavailable or offline condition of the MSERV. In response to detecting the offline condition the MCS assigns a CACHEID to the incoming message VMSG and holds C X the message contents VMSG along with the CACHEID in the Cache.

Information flow X continues when a user accesses X the enterprise network system to retrieve his her voice mail messages while the MSERV remains in an offline condition. Upon being provided with access to the MCS the user selects a voice mail message from a list of CACHEIDs generated from the collection of voice mail messages held for him her in the cache. In response to the user selection the MCS searches X the Cache using the Cache identification CACHEID of the selected message. Upon locating the voice mail message by its CACHEID in the Cache the MCS pulls R X the voice mail message contents from the Cache and plays the voice mail message for the user as appropriate to the action selected by the user.

The MCS continues to monitor the condition of the MSERV. At such time as the MCS detects a return of the MSERV to an online condition the MCS pulls P X the voice mail message VMSG and its CACHEID from the Cache and transfers M X the voice mail message and CACHEID via the IM to the MSERV. The MSERV assigns an identification VMSGID to the incoming voice mail message VMSG and stores X the voice mail message VMSG along with the VMSGID and CACHEID in one or more areas of memory as described above.

In addition to the capabilities described above the ICS of an embodiment provides a Form Based User Interface FBUI . The FBUI is a form based messaging or communication interface for use by users in retrieving voice mail messages and controlling actions taken on voice mail messages received in the enterprise network system. This FBUI enables a user to retrieve and take various actions on voice mail messages using data of a form referred to herein as the FBUI FORM that is presented to the user s client device by the enterprise network email system. Use of the FBUI Form thus provides the user with access to the integrated messaging functions offered by the ICS without a requirement to install or run a dedicated client application on the user s client device.

Messaging server environment X includes the MSERV and a Database X but is not so limited. The LAN couples to any number of other networks X and X using any of a variety of communication protocols where the networks X and X may be of the same or of different types. As an example the networks may include a public communications network X and a private communications network X. Private communications network X may be a PBX coupled to the LAN of the enterprise network for example. Networks X and X allow for information transfers between client devices X that are local to enterprise network X and client devices X that are external to enterprise network X. The client devices may alternatively be referred to as user devices X and X.

ICS X replaces the voice mail server typically found in enterprise networks with at least one MCS X. MCS X is coupled to the private communications network e.g. PBX of each network enterprise. While one MCS is shown in this example system X the enterprise network may include multiple MCSs X coupled to enterprise network in an N 1 configuration where N is any number 1 2 . . . X.

For security reasons communication to and from the MCS is restricted in an embodiment. The MCS communicates with the IM servers the private communications network other MCSs and selected client devices. According to an embodiment of the invention communications with the MCS may be restricted to network components having particular known addresses. Additionally or alternatively communications with the MCS may require authentication by passcode or other security measures for certain kinds of access for example for access by the administrator. Security may also or alternatively be encrypted and or provided by requiring a physical connection between the MCS and other component such as in the case of a connection between an MCS and a private communications network through a direct cable connection.

The MCS via the FBUI generally provides a form to a client device from a first server e.g. messaging server MSERV etc. via a network connection. The form includes data or code that when executed by the receiving client device results in presentation of a FBUI on a display of the client device. The FBUI includes a number of buttons or icons that allow a user to select an action on an item via a second server e.g. communication server MCS etc. where the item is stored on the first and or second servers and the first and second servers are different servers. The FBUI of an embodiment uses a web browser embedded in the form as the means for coupling and or communicating with a corresponding browser control of the second server. Communications between the client device and the second server thus avoid security and or other network policy issues that would prohibit the client device from communicating with the second server via the network coupling between the client device and the first server.

As described above the FBUI operates as a form based messaging interface to transfer a first message e.g. voice mail message to a messaging server e.g. MSERV from a communication server e.g. MCS via a first coupling e.g. IM . The messaging server generates a second message e.g. email message in response to a type of the first message and transfers the second message to a client device via a second coupling e.g. LAN . The type of the first message is specified by the communication server using properties on the message that identify the message as a Voice Mail Type VMT message. The second message is of a different type and includes data of the first message but is not so limited. The communication server also transfers to the client device form data that corresponds to the first message. The client device uses the form data to establish a third coupling e.g. browser link between the client device and the communication server. The user may direct actions on the first message from the client device via the third coupling using the form data.

The ICS of an embodiment provides the FBUI X to a user via his her local client device. The FBUI is provided to the client device through the use of a FBUI Form where the structure of the FBUI Form conforms to the message structure of the messaging server environment. For example when the messaging server environment includes the use of Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook the FBUI Form is generated to comply with Microsoft formats as appropriate to Exchange and Outlook

Information for generation of the FBUI Form is provided to the messaging server environment by the MCS via the IM and the code used for FBUI Form generation is hosted by the MSERV in an embodiment. The FBUI Form of an embodiment includes code that generates information of the FBUI display as well as the buttons of the display. The FBUI Form further includes an embedded browser control for use in establishing communications between the client device displaying the FBUI Form and a web server e.g. MCS IM other server for example. The embedded browser control therefore allows the host client device to couple and communicate with a server that is different from the MSERV via a communication channel that is outside the enterprise network LAN. Thus the FBUI Form enables a communication channel between the local client device currently executing the form and a component like the MCS and or IM in spite of network policy issues that otherwise might prohibit the client device from communicating outside the enterprise network message infrastructure.

Using the FBUI a user can access view and take a variety of actions on his her voice mail messages within an email framework of the host enterprise network system. As an example when the MCS of an embodiment receives a voice mail message it transfers the voice mail message to the MSERV as described above. In transferring the voice mail message to the MSERV the MCS specifies properties on the message that identify the message as a Voice Mail Type VMT message. The message is received and stored by the MSERV as a VMT message using the same storage and retrieval structure as used with other message types like email messages.

At such time as a user wishes to access his her messages via his her client device the active message browser of the client device receives the VMT message along with any other mail messages currently stored in his her electronic mail box. The message browser corresponds to the message structure of the messaging server environment e.g. Outlook in a Microsoft environment . Upon receipt of the message the message browser identifies the message as a VMT message. As the code that implements the FBUI Form is stored on the MSERV implementation of the functionality and or features associated with the FBUI Form uses communication between the user s client device and the MSERV via the LAN. For example the client device message browser requests the FBUI Form from the MSERV in response to identifying a message as a VMT message because this is the form that corresponds to the VMT message type. The MSERV transfers the FBUI Form to the requesting client device and the client device message browser launches the form in response to the user selecting a VMT message for viewing.

The message browser uses data or code of the FBUI Form to display the FBUI on the user s client device. is a sample FBUI X as displayed on a client device under an embodiment. The FBUI X includes three areas X X that present information to a user. The areas include a folder area X a contents area X and a function area X but are not limited to these areas as the UIs of alternative embodiments may present any number and or type of areas. In alternative embodiments all three areas X X may be presented at the same time as shown in FBUI X or various subsets of the three areas may be presented at the same time in various combinations.

Folder area X presents one or more folders to which the user has access via the FBUI X and the client device. The INBOX may contain a list of voice mail messages in the same listing as other messages including email messages. Alternatively the Inbox may include a subfolder VOICE MESSAGES which includes the voice mail messages and selection of this folder results in the presentation of voice mail messages of the user s mail box in the contents area X.

The contents area X generally presents the contents of the folder selected using the folder area X. As an example the contents area X presents information corresponding to any number of voice mail messages in the user s mail box when the INBOX or VOICE MESSAGES folder is selected. Contents area X allows the user to select a particular voice mail message by placing a cursor on VOICE MESSAGE 1 INFORMATION for example. By double clicking a message in the contents area X or otherwise indicating to the message browser to display a voice message a new window referred to as the ICS Window is displayed. The ICS Window now includes function are X.

Function area X of FBUI X presents one or more voice mail action buttons A X E X also referred to herein as buttons each of which represents an action the user may select for a voice mail message. In this example the VOICE MESSAGES folder is selected and selection of a message in contents area X allows the user to take an action on the selected message using buttons A X E X. Placing the cursor of contents area X on a particular message and choosing an action on the selected message with a button A X E X therefore invokes operations on the message via components of the ICS e.g. MCS Cache IM . The buttons A X E X of an embodiment include a Play on Phone button A X a Play on Computer button B X a Call Sender button C X a Reply by Voicemail button D X and a Forward by Voicemail button E X but the embodiment is not limited to this same number of buttons or to buttons offering the same functionality.

In other embodiments presentation of areas or information of the FBUI may vary in many ways. For example in one embodiment the action buttons X appear after the user has selected for example by double clicking a particular voice message from the contents area X. Action buttons X may also appear when the user right clicks on a particular voice message in the contents area X.

The folder area X may also include a subfolder VOICE MESSAGE SYSTEM under the Public Folder. As such the VOICE MESSAGE SYSTEM folder may not be considered an actual folder but instead a uniform resource locator URL that when selected sends an HTTP request to a web server and launches displays an ICS browser inside the client device message browser. The web server may for example be a component of the MCS and or IM but is not so limited. The ICS browser is an embedded or hidden browser that displays the ICS Window in the area of the client device message browser where emails would typically appear and the voice mail messages are displayed in the ICS Window.

As an example the ICS Window is displayed in the contents area X of an embodiment. The ICS Window may be served from the IM and may contain any information related to the voice messaging system that is user specific. In one embodiment the ICS Window will display a user login prompt where the user enters the user name and PIN code. Subsequently the system displays the user s configuration date such as PIN code attendant extension greeting type and other applicable information.

The hidden browser enables an HTTP link and communications with the IM for example which then brokers communications via HTTP with the MCS via the MCS Web Server for example. Therefore while typical messaging servers and LANs use security policies that restrict the use of special code in form data use of the hidden browser embedded in a form structure that is native to the host system overcomes this restriction because the browser is not detected or considered as special code. Use of the hidden browser thus supports communication with the corresponding browser control in the MCS and or the IM thereby allowing the integration of voice mail messaging provided by the MCS with the email messaging system of the enterprise network

A voice mail message in the ICS is generally any message created using a client device generating an audio stream. A voice mail message is also any VMT message such as a message created using the Reply by Voice Message and Forward by Voice Message buttons of the FBUI. An email is any message created using buttons of a host mail message system that function to generate a reply message or to forward a message in response to receipt of a message even if replying or forwarding a voice mail message. The ICS of an embodiment presents a voice mail message to a user in an email message system using the FBUI as the presentation form.

As described above FBUI X allows a user to take action on a voice mail message via buttons A X E X of FBUI X. Therefore placing the cursor of contents area X on a particular message and choosing an action on the selected message with a button A X E X invokes the action on the message via components of the MCS and or the enterprise network environment.

As one example of an action on a voice mail message and with further reference to the user may select a Play on Phone action using button A X. In response the user s client device couples to a component of the ICS e.g. IM using the hidden browser of the FBUI. The client device receives a pop up message from the ICS via the browser link and the ICS Window where the pop up message allows the user to choose or enter a telephone number to which he she would like the selected voice mail message routed. The pop up message also includes a connect button by which the user initiates routing of the selected voice mail message to the selected telephone. In response to selection of the connect button the IM couples with an MCS and the MCS causes the PBX to initiate a call to the telephone number selected by the user via the pop up window. Upon connection of the call from the PBX to the selected telephone the MCS pushes the contents of the voice mail message to the selected telephone.

Another example of an action on a voice mail message includes selection of a Play on Computer action by the user via button B X. In response the user s client device couples to a component of the ICS e.g. IM using the hidden browser of the FBUI. In response to selection of the Play on Computer button the IM couples with an MCS and the MCS pushes a form to the user s computer that resembles a typical email. The form includes an attachment that is an audio file e.g. WAVE MP3 other audio formats etc. . When the user selects the attachment the client device may launch the default audio player of the client device.

Alternatively selection of the attachment in a Play on Computer action may result in the browser form controlling launch of a pre specified audio player instead of the default audio player. This is similar to the hidden browser described above with reference to presentation of the FBUI.

The user may also select a Call Sender action on a voice mail message using button C X. In response the user s client device couples to a component of the ICS e.g. IM using the hidden browser of the FBUI. In response to selection of the Call Sender button the IM couples with an MCS and the MCS retrieves the selected message from the Cache or the MSERV. Using the caller information from the retrieved message the MCS causes the PBX to connect the call to the user s local telephone. Upon connection of the call from the PBX to the user s telephone the MCS causes the PBX to initiate a call to the sender s telephone number as determined from the caller information associated with the voice message.

Additionally the user may select a Reply by Voice Message action on a voice mail message using button D X. In response the user s client device couples to a component of the ICS e.g. IM using the hidden browser of the FBUI. In response to selection of the Reply by Voice Message button the IM couples with an MCS and the MCS retrieves the selected message from the Cache or the MSERV. The MCS causes a reply message to be generated corresponding to the received message and prompts the user to record an audio message for the reply. The user records the audio for the reply via a microphone coupled to his her client device. Alternatively the user may record the audio for the reply via his her local telephone. Upon completing the audio reply recording the MCS causes the reply message to be transmitted to the designated addressees via the MSERV. A user is not required to listen to a message to invoke the Reply by Voice Message action.

The user may also select a Forward by Voice Message action on a voice mail message using button E X. In response the user s client device couples to a component of the ICS e.g. IM using the hidden browser of the FBUI. The client device receives a pop up message from the ICS via the browser link where the pop up message allows the user to choose or enter a telephone number to which he she would like the selected voice mail message routed. The pop up message also includes a connect button by which the user initiates routing of the selected voice mail message to the selected telephone. In response to selection of the connect button the IM couples with an MCS and the MCS causes the PBX to initiate a call to the telephone number selected by the user via the pop up window. Upon connection of the call from the PBX to the called telephone selected by the user the MCS pushes the contents of the voice mail message to the called telephone and the user. During the session and in addition to the contents of the voice mail message the MCS may provide a verbal prompt to the user requesting information of the party to whom the message is to be forwarded and or a prompt to the user to record an audio message to be forwarded along with the forwarded message. A user is not required to listen to a message to invoke the Forward by Voice Message action.

More generally is a block diagram of a system X that uses a form based interface X transferred in a first type of message for controlling actions on a second type of message along with the corresponding information flows under an embodiment. System X generally includes an enterprise network coupled to one or more public communications networks X via a private communication network X. Enterprise network X includes at least one first server Server A and at least one interface module X both of which couple to a LAN. Server A also couples to private communication network X. In an embodiment components of Server A and interface module X function collectively to form an ICS as described herein but are not limited to ICS functionality.

System X further includes a backend network environment X and a user workstation X each of which couple to the LAN. Backend network environment X includes at least one server Server B but may include any number of servers databases and or other components. Components of user workstation X also couple to the LAN the workstation components including a telephone P X and a client device C X that are local to enterprise network X. Server A and interface module X cause form based interface X to be displayed to User Z via Server B and client device C X. Public communications network X and enterprise network X allow information transfers between components that are local to enterprise network X and client devices X that are external to enterprise network X.

In response to receiving a data stream at an input of private communication network X enterprise network X uses the integrated communication processes described herein to cause Server A to generate and transfer a first message to Server B. The first message is transferred to Server B via interface module X. Server B generates a second message in response to properties of the first message and transfers the second message to local client device C X via the LAN. The second message is a different type message than the first message and includes information of the first message. In an embodiment a type of the first message is a voice mail type and a type of the second message is an email type.

Local client device C X requests form data from Server B in response to information of the first message and Server B in turn provides the requested form data to local client device C X via the LAN. Local client device C X executes the form data resulting in presentation of form based interface on a display of user workstation X.

While local client device C X is described as being local to enterprise network it is understood that client device C X is not required to reside at any particular physical location within enterprise network X. For example local client device C X may be a tablet PC C X from which User Z who is off site remotely accesses components of enterprise network X e.g. Server B via a virtual private network VPN for example.

Upon display on local client device C X form based interface X presents a number of soft buttons X or action buttons X that allow User Z to control actions on data that resides at Server A and or Server B via communications with interface module X and Server A. These actions are controlled via a form browser control embedded in the form data. This form browser control thus allows the local client device via the form based interface to couple to and communicate with Server A via an Independent Access Channel IAC e.g. browser link that is independent of the LAN. The coupling between local client device C X and Server A is via a corresponding browser control of Server A and interface module X but is not so limited.

Action buttons X of form based interface X enable User Z to control or direct actions on data held and or stored at Server A and or Server B. The data may be the first message that was previously transferred to Server B but is not so limited this first message may be held at Server A and or stored at Server B as appropriate to a state e.g. online offline of Server B as described above. Action buttons X of form based interface X enable user control of actions on the data held and or stored at Server A and or Server B via the IAC between local client device C X interface module X and Server A.

Each of action buttons X when selected by User Z calls the form data of the form based interface form as appropriate to the action corresponding to the selected action button X. The form data locates the browser control corresponding to the action selected by User Z and the browser control directs the embedded browser of the form based interface form to the corresponding URL of interface module X and or Server A. As such selection of an action button establishes the IAC between local client device C X interface module X and Server A.

In response to selection of one or more actions via the action buttons Server A may transfer status and or control data referred to as status control data to local client device C X via the established IAC. Server A of an embodiment transfers the status control data via interface module X but is not so limited. Execution of the status control data on local client device C X results in the display of popup X where popup X is a web browser window that may be smaller than form based interface window X and without some of the standard features such as tool bars.

Popup X may present User Z with information regarding status of the selected action prompts to select information via popup X prompts to enter information via one or more fields of popup X and prompts to initiate further actions but is not limited to presentation of only this information. In response to entry of any additional information into popup X in response to queries or prompts and or selection of any further actions by User Z local client device C X transfers data of the additional information and or selection to Server A via the established IAC and interface module X.

In an example in which server actions are controlled via a form based interface with continued reference to Server A generates and transfers a first message to Server B via interface module X. Server B in turn generates a second message in response to properties of the first message and transfers the second message to local client device C X via the LAN. Local client device C X requests and receives via the LAN form data from Server B in response to information of the first message. Local client device C X executes the form data and presents form based interface X on a display of local client device C X.

Form based interface X as described above presents one or more soft action buttons X to User Z. Selection of an action button X by User Z establishes communication X between local client device C X and Server A via the IAC and interface module X. Server A determines a location of information needed to fulfill the requested action. If Server A determines the action corresponding to selected action button X uses information from backend network environment X e.g. Server B then Server A directs X interface module X to pull X the information from components of the backend network environment as described above and interface module X pushes X the pulled information to Server A.

Server A executes the action on the information as appropriate to selected action button X. As an example the action may include establishing communication with A X and or forwarding the information to an external client device X. Establishing communication A X and or forwarding takes place via a coupling between Server A and external client device X that includes one or more of private communication network X and public communications network X but is not so limited.

As another example the selected action may include establishing communication with B X and or forwarding the information to a client device X within enterprise network X. The client device of enterprise network X includes a local user telephone P X or client device C X for example but can include a variety of devices. Establishing communication B X and or forwarding takes place via a coupling between Server A and local client device P X C X that includes one or more couplings via the LAN but is not necessarily so limited.

In response to selection of one or more actions via the action buttons Server A may transfer SC X status control data to local client device C X via the established IAC. Server A of an embodiment transfers SC X the status control data via interface module X but is not so limited. Execution of the status control data on local client device C X results in the display of a popup X on a display of local client device C X via the form based interface. Popup X presents the status control data to User Z. In response to entry of any additional information into popup X in response to queries or prompts and or selection of any further actions by User Z local client device C X transfers X data of the additional information and or selection to Server A via the established IAC and interface module X.

As generally described above the form based interface of an embodiment more specifically includes the FBUI of the ICS. The FBUI operates as a form based messaging interface to transfer a first message e.g. voice mail message to a messaging server e.g. MSERV from a communication server e.g. MCS via a first coupling e.g. IM . The messaging server generates a second message e.g. email message in response to a type of the first message and transfers the second message to a client device via a second coupling e.g. LAN . The type of the first message is specified by the communication server using properties on the message that identify the message as a Voice Mail Type VMT message. The second message is of a different type and includes data of the first message but is not so limited. The communication server also transfers to the client device form data that includes the FBUI Form where the FBUI Form corresponds to the first message. The client device uses the FBUI Form data to establish a third coupling e.g. browser link between the client device and the communication server. The user may direct actions on the first message from the client device via the third coupling using the form data.

Referring again to and X the ICS of an embodiment provides the FBUI to a user via his her local client device. The FBUI is provided to the client device through the use of a FBUI Form where the structure of the FBUI Form conforms to the message structure of the messaging server environment. For example when the messaging server environment includes the use of Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook the FBUI Form is generated to comply with Microsoft formats as appropriate to Exchange and Outlook.

Information for generation of the FBUI Form is provided to the messaging server environment by the MCS via the IM and the code used for FBUI Form generation is hosted by the MSERV in an embodiment. The FBUI Form of an embodiment includes code that generates information of the FBUI display as well as the buttons of the display. The FBUI Form further includes an embedded browser control for use in establishing communications between the client device displaying the FBUI Form and a web server e.g. MCS IM other server for example. The embedded browser control therefore allows the host client device to couple and communicate with a server that is different from the MSERV via a communication channel IAC that is outside the enterprise network LAN. Thus the FBUI Form enables a communication channel between the local client device currently executing the form and a component like the MCS and or IM in spite of network policy issues that otherwise prohibit the client device from communicating outside the enterprise network message infrastructure.

The FBUI thus allows a user to access view and take a variety of actions on his her voice mail messages within an email framework of the host enterprise network system. As an example when the MCS of an embodiment receives a voice mail message it transfers the voice mail message to the MSERV as described above. In transferring the voice mail message to the MSERV the MCS specifies properties on the message that identify the message as a VMT message. The message is received and stored by the MSERV as a VMT message using the same storage and retrieval structure as used with other message types like email messages.

At such time as a user wishes to access his her messages via his her client device the active message browser of the client device receives the VMT message along with any other mail messages currently stored in his her electronic mail box. The message browser corresponds to the message structure of the messaging server environment e.g. Outlook in a Microsoft environment . Upon receipt of the message the message browser identifies the message as a VMT message. As the code that implements the FBUI Form is stored on the MSERV implementation of the functionality and or features associated with the FBUI Form uses communication between the user s client device and the MSERV via the LAN. For example the client device message browser requests the FBUI Form from the MSERV in response to identifying a message as a VMT message because this is the form that corresponds to the VMT message type. The MSERV transfers the FBUI Form to the requesting client device as client side code and the client device message browser launches the form in response to the user selecting a VMT message for viewing.

As one example of an action on a voice mail message and with further reference to the user may select a Play on Phone action using button A X. In response the user s client device couples to a component of the ICS e.g. IM using the hidden browser of the FBUI. The client device receives a popup message from the ICS via the browser link where the popup message allows the user to choose or enter a telephone number to which he she would like the selected voice mail message routed the MCS may not display the popup window if during an active Play on Phone session a user selects a second voice mail message for play . The popup message also includes a connect button by which the user initiates routing of the selected voice mail message to the selected telephone. In response to selection of the connect button the IM couples with an MCS and the MCS causes the PBX to initiate a call to the telephone number selected by the user via the popup window. Upon connection of the call from the PBX to the selected telephone the MCS pushes the contents of the voice mail message to the selected telephone.

In response to selection of one or more actions via the action buttons ICS components of an embodiment may transfer status control data in response to actions selected via the action buttons. As described above with reference to execution of the status control data on the local client device results in the display of a popup window. The popup is a web browser window that may present a user with information that includes prompts to select information needed by the ICS to complete an action prompts to enter information needed by the ICS to complete an action status of a selected action and prompts to initiate further actions but is not limited to presentation of only this information.

As an example is a selection popup X or ICS Window the ICS provides during execution of the Play on Phone action under an embodiment. The ICS presents selection popup X as a means by which a user selects or enters information needed by the ICS to complete an action corresponding to a selected action button. Selection popup X of this example Voice Message Interface Call Number allows the user to choose a telephone number e.g. Work Phone X Cell Phone X Home Phone X to which he she would like the selected voice mail message routed. Selection popup X also allows the user to enter into a popup field X a telephone number to which he she would like the selected voice mail message routed. Popup message X also includes a Call button X by which the user initiates connection and or routing of the selected voice mail message to the selected telephone. Selection entry of a telephone number and activation of Call button X by the user causes the local client device to transfer the selection entry to the ICS.

As another example is a status popup X the ICS provides during execution of the Play on Phone action under an embodiment. The ICS presents status popup X to provide the user with status information of the selected action e.g. Play on Phone . Status popup X of this example Voice Message Call Status informs the user that current status X of the call to the number previously selected entered is Connecting but the status may include other status information including but not limited to dialing line busy unable to complete call no answer etc. Any amount or type of status information may be displayed using any number and or combination of popup windows in alternative embodiments.

Components of the ICS of an embodiment provide for storage of voice mail messages in an email messaging structure of an enterprise network as described above. The ICS components also provide a form based interface to a client device via the messaging server. The ICS and form based interface also provide the user with a system for accessing and directing action on the voice mail messages outside of the communication policies of the enterprise network. The form based interface also eliminates the requirement for a dedicated client application on the user s client device.

One action the ICS allows on voice mail messages is the Play on Phone action described above. Play on Phone allows a user accessing the enterprise network via a local client device to select a telephone to which voice mail messages can be forwarded. As an example a user who is away from the office on vacation may access the enterprise network using a portable computer e.g. via VPN and use the Play on Phone action of the FBUI to direct his her voice mail messages to be routed to his her cellular telephone. In response components of the enterprise network including the ICS initiate a call to the user s cellular telephone number retrieve the selected voice mail messages and play the messages over the call.

The operation of routing voice mail messages to a user selected device like a telephone during the Play on Phone action includes a number of information transfers among components of the ICS and the host enterprise network. is an information flow in a system X that includes an ICS supporting Play on Phone operations under an embodiment. System X includes an enterprise network X coupled to one or more public communications networks X via a PBX. Enterprise network X includes at least one MCS and at least one IM both of which couple between the PBX and a messaging and collaboration server MSERV. In an embodiment components of the MCS and IM function collectively to form the ICS as described herein but operation of the MCS and or IM is not limited to ICS functionality. System further includes at least one local client device X that couples to enterprise network X.

The MCS and IM operate to cause FBUI X to be displayed to User Z via the MSERV and local client device X. Public communications network X and enterprise network X allow information transfers between client devices X that are local to enterprise network X and client devices X that are external to enterprise network X. In this example external client device X is a cellular telephone of User Z but is not so limited.

The information flow begins when the PBX transfers X a data stream to the MCS. The data stream may for example be an audio stream of an incoming call from a caller to User Z. Enterprise network X uses processes of the ICS described herein to cause the MCS to generate and transfer X a first message to the IM. The first message includes information of the received data stream and a type of the first message is a voice mail message but is not so limited. The IM in turn transfers X the first message to the MSERV. The MSERV generates a second message in response to properties of the first message and transfers the second message to local client device X via communications over the enterprise network. The type of the second message is an email message where the email message includes information of the first message but is not so limited.

Local client device X receives the second message and requests X form data from the MSERV in response to information of the second message. The MSERV retrieves X the requested form data and transfers X the retrieved form data to local client device X via the enterprise network. Local client device X executes the form data resulting in presentation of FBUI X on a display of user workstation X.

While local client device X is described as being local to enterprise network X it is understood that client device X is not required to reside at any particular physical location within enterprise network X. For example local client device X may be a portable PC X from which User Z off site remotely accesses components of enterprise network X e.g. MSERV via a VPN.

FBUI X as described above presents one or more soft action buttons X to User Z. This example assumes selection of Play on Phone button X by User Z. Selection of Play on Phone establishes communication X between local client device X and the MCS via the IAC and the IM.

As an example of establishing communication selecting Play on Phone via the FBUI causes the client device local browser to call the function in the form data that corresponds to the Play on Phone operation. The form data when called generates a URL request code corresponding to the Play on Phone action and the URL request expresses the ICS data that is to be transferred to the IM and the MCS. The ICS data of the URL request includes for example a message identification corresponding to the selected voice mail message for use by the IM MCS in accessing the voice mail message stored in the MSERV environment user identification and identification information of the action desired by User Z Play on Phone . The URL request subsequently directs the FBUI embedded browser to the specified URL.

In response to receiving the URL request via communication X from local client device X the MCS determines a location of information e.g. user information voice mail message contents etc. needed to fulfill the Play on Phone operation. If the MCS determines the Play on Phone uses information from the MSERV environment then the MCS directs X the IM to pull X the information from components of the MSERV environment as described above e.g. directory service and the IM returns X the pulled information to the MCS.

In response to selection of Play on Phone the MCS generates and transfers X status control data e.g. HTML to local client device X via the IAC. Execution of the status control data on local client device X causes the FBUI embedded browser to display a popup window .

Popup window X corresponding to status control data transfer X for example is selection popup X described with reference to . This example assumes User Z directs X routing of his her voice mail messages to his her cellular telephone X by selecting Cell Phone in popup X but the embodiment is not so limited. The selection of Cell Phone along with activation of the Call button via popup X causes the form data to generate another URL request code that is transferred X to the IM and the MCS.

Upon receiving the URL request with the selected cellular telephone number from local client device X the IM uses the message identification of the selected voice mail message user identification and the selected cellular telephone number to transfer a request to the MCS for initiation of the Play on Phone call.

The MCS initiates a call to cellular telephone X via communications X with the PBX. The MCS which manages call functions of the ICS initiates the call by directing the PBX to place the call to cellular telephone X. The MCS enforces any User Z COS parameters of enterprise network X. The call is made via any number of telephony interfaces including T1 E1 DSE VoIP and analog but is not so limited.

During the process of initiating X the call the MCS transfers X status information of the call e.g. from the PBX to local client device X. The MCS transfers X via the IM the status information using a status message in popup window X to provide the user with status information of the Play on Phone call to his her cellular telephone. An example of status message popup X is described above with reference to . The status information is continually updated during the process of making the call but is not so limited.

When the call to cellular telephone X is successfully connected by the PBX the MCS transfers X the selected voice mail messages to cellular telephone X. Successful connection of the call causes status message popup X to close. In contrast when the call is not successfully connected for any reason e.g. error line busy no answer call not authorized etc. then a status message indicating failure of the call is displayed in popup X along with the close button.
