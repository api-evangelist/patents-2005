The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60 684 660 entitled CONTENT TRANSFER CONTROL FOR WIRELESS DEVICES filed May 25 2005 and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.

Advances in technology have resulted in smaller and more powerful personal computing devices. For example there currently exist a variety of portable personal computing devices including wireless computing devices such as portable wireless telephones personal digital assistants PDAs and paging devices that are each small lightweight and can be easily carried by users. More specifically the portable wireless telephones for example further include cellular telephones that communicate voice and data packets over wireless networks. Further many such cellular telephones are being manufactured with relatively large increases in computing capabilities and as such are becoming tantamount to small personal computers and hand held PDAs. However these smaller and more powerful personal computing devices are typically severely resource constrained. For example the screen size amount of available memory and file system space amount of input and output capabilities and processing capability may each be limited by the small size of the device. Because of such severe resource constraints it is often typically desirable for example to maintain a limited size and quantity of software applications and other information residing on such remote personal computing devices client devices .

If content transfer controls are not in place on wireless device content that is unprotected from redistribution transferred to wireless device whether from server or a computer system of the user not shown may be transferred to other wireless devices such as wireless device without regard for any potential licensing issues. For example content may be a purchased audio file with terms restricting further distribution or use beyond wireless device .

A content transfer control system for a wireless device includes a content transfer control component arranged to a detect licensed content and b transfer a content source indicating a source of the licensed content responsive to detection of licensed content.

A method embodiment includes transmitting content from the wireless device if the content is not determined to be licensed content and transmitting a content source from the wireless device if the content is determined to be licensed content.

Still other advantages of the disclosed embodiments will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description wherein the preferred embodiments are shown and described simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated of carrying out the embodiments. As will be realized the embodiments are capable of other and different embodiments and the several details are capable of modifications in various obvious respects all without departing from the embodiments. The advantages of the disclosed embodiments may also be realized and attained by the means of the instrumentalities and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

According to an embodiment the CTC application provides a mechanism for controlling communication of content between wireless devices using wireless network . In particular the present embodiments enable wireless devices to set up CTC application controlled communication transfers to exchange content e.g. audio text video and other content.

A CTC application i.e. a set of executable instructions resident on each wireless device is executable to effect control of the exchange of content between wireless devices . As depicted communication of content between wireless devices occurs under control of CTC application . Further as depicted wireless device may include content dash dot line for communication to wireless device .

Execution of CTC application described more fully below in conjunction with B and by wireless device causes the creation of a content container corresponding to the combination of content and a CTC application generated header . In an embodiment CTC application generates a header for each content obtained from server . In another embodiment CTC application generates a header for each instance of content without regard for the origination of the content e.g. whether or not the content is obtained from server a user computer system or other mechanism. In another embodiment content container is encrypted and signed.

Header includes a license identifier ID specifying one or more of different license types applicable to content a content source specifying a location on wireless network of the content associated with the header and an optional content ID dotted line specifying an identifier e.g. an International Standard Book Numbering ISBN value an International Standard Music Number ISMN value an European Article Numbering EAN value etc. identifying the content. License ID may be an alphanumeric numeric alphabetic or other representation of the license type applicable.

Subsequent to creation of header a user causes execution of CTC application by wireless device to transfer content to wireless device via wireless network . In another embodiment direct communication between wireless devices is contemplated. For example a peer to peer communication mechanism such as an infra red WiFi Bluetooth or other wireless device to wireless device server less communication mechanism may be used.

Prior to transferring content CTC application determines whether license ID of header associated with content permits transfer of content to wireless device . If license ID allows transfer of content CTC application enables the transfer of the content from wireless device to wireless device . Conversely if license ID restricts transfer of content CTC application disables the transfer of the content between wireless devices . Further if the transfer of content between wireless devices is restricted CTC application enables the transfer of content source between wireless devices instead of content . In this manner wireless devices are prevented from transferring license restricted content however wireless device is provided information i.e. content source enabling the wireless device to connect to server and obtain licensed content .

In an embodiment if no header corresponds to content CTC application enables the transfer of the content between wireless devices . In another embodiment if no header corresponds to content CTC application disables the transfer of the content between wireless devices .

In another embodiment content ID enables the wireless devices to perform a search e.g. using a search engine on server to locate a lower cost source of content . That is wireless device may be used to shop for content on other servers not shown accessible via wireless network . In this manner a user of wireless device is able to more easily search for content using content ID .

Wireless device establishes a network connection message sequence . When the user of wireless device desires to transfer content to wireless device the user manipulates the wireless device causing the execution of CTC application . Execution of CTC application by wireless device causes the CTC application to determine based on license ID in header corresponding to content if content is able to be transferred between wireless devices . After CTC application determines content is able to be transferred between wireless devices wireless device transfers content to wireless device message sequence . In another embodiment CTC application determines based on the absence of a corresponding header or license ID corresponding to content that the content is able to be transferred between wireless devices . In an alternate embodiment CTC application determines based on the absence of a corresponding header or license ID corresponding to content that the content is restricted from being able to be transferred between wireless devices .

Wireless device establishes a network connection message sequence . When the user of wireless device desires to transfer content to wireless device the user manipulates the wireless device causing the execution of CTC application . Execution of CTC application by wireless device causes the CTC application to determine based on license ID in header corresponding to content if content is able to be transferred between wireless devices . After CTC application determines content is restricted from being transferred between wireless device wireless device transfers content source from header corresponding to content to wireless device message sequence .

After receipt of content source wireless device is able to issue a content request message sequence to server requesting content identified by content source . After receipt of the content request from wireless device server transfers message sequence content to wireless device .

After wireless device is manipulated to attempt to transfer content to wireless device by the user of the device the flow transitions to step . During step execution of CTC application by wireless device causes the CTC application to determine based on header and more specifically license ID the restrictions associated with content . If in step CTC application determines based on license ID that transfer of content is licensed the flow transitions to step and transfer of the content is enabled from wireless device to wireless device . After content transfers between wireless devices the flow transitions back to idle step . In another embodiment if there is no license corresponding to content the determination at step results in a licensed transfer determination i.e. the flow transitions to step .

If in step CTC application determines that transfer of content is not licensed the flow transitions to step and transfer of content is disabled and transfer of content source is enabled between wireless devices . It will be understood that in different embodiments different sequences of steps and transitions may be used to accomplish the embodiments described above. For example determination of licensed or unlicensed content in step may entail decryption and or signature verification performed by CTC application or other supporting executable instructions executed by wireless device .

Wireless device establishes a network connection message sequence . When the user of wireless device desires to transfer content to wireless device the user manipulates the wireless device causing the execution of CTC application . Execution of CTC application by wireless device causes the CTC application to determine based on license ID in header corresponding to content if content is able to be transferred between wireless devices . After CTC application determines content is able to be transferred between wireless devices wireless device transfers content to wireless device message sequence may also be referred to as a first message . In another embodiment CTC application determines based on the absence of a corresponding header or license ID corresponding to content that the content is able to be transferred between wireless devices . In an alternate embodiment CTC application determines based on the absence of a corresponding header or license ID corresponding to content that the content is restricted from being able to be transferred between wireless devices .

Further although the foregoing discussion describes the transfer of content from an origination wireless device to a destination wireless device the transfer direction may in one or more embodiments occur in the other direction and or bi directionally. That is destination wireless device may connect to and transfer content to originating wireless device and or the wireless devices may transfer content to each other. Further still in one or more embodiments the origination wireless device may transfer content to a network connected computing device e.g. a personal desktop or laptop computer server etc.

Some of the personal computing devices utilize application programming interfaces APIs sometimes referred to as runtime environments and software platforms that are installed onto their local computer platform and which are used for example to simplify operations of such devices such as by providing generalized calls for device specific resources. Further some such APIs are also known to provide software developers the ability to create software applications that are fully executable on such devices. In addition some of such APIs are known to be operationally located between the computing device system software and the software applications such that the computing device computing functionality is made available to the software applications without requiring the software developer to have the specific computing device system source code. Further some APIs are known to provide mechanisms for secure communications between such personal devices i.e. clients and remote devices i.e. servers using secure cryptographic information.

After receipt of content source wireless device is able to issue a content request message sequence to server requesting content identified by content source . After receipt of the content request from wireless device server transfers message sequence may also be referred to as a second message content to wireless device .

One or more embodiments are used in conjunction with a runtime environment API executing on the computing device. One such runtime environment API is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW software previously discussed. However one or more of the described embodiments can be used with other types of runtime environments APIs that for example operate to control the execution of applications on wireless client computing devices.

The application download server is shown here on a network with other computer elements in communication with the wireless network . There can be a stand alone server and each server can provide separate services and processes to the client devices across the wireless network . System may also include at least one stored application database that holds the software applications e.g. a content transfer control CTC application that are downloadable by the wireless devices the CTC application is indicated as being downloadable to the wireless devices by a dashed line . However those skilled in the art will appreciate that the configuration illustrated in is merely exemplary. Accordingly other embodiments can include one of more servers that can each perform all the described functions and contain all necessary hardware and software or can contain only selected functionality.

In a block diagram is shown that more fully illustrates system including the components of the wireless network and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments. System is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote client devices such as wireless client computing devices communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components connected via a wireless network including without limitation wireless network carriers and or servers. The application download server and the stored application database communicate with a carrier network through a data link such as the Internet a secure LAN WAN or other network. Stored application database includes a CTC application according to the above described embodiments for download to each of the wireless client computer devices . Wireless client computer devices download a copy of CTC application dashed line from stored applications database . In the embodiment shown a server can include the application download server distribution server and the stored application database . However these servers can also be independent devices.

Still referring to the embodiment of carrier network controls messages generally being data packets sent to a messaging service controller MSC . Carrier network communicates with the MSC through another communications link such as another network the Internet and or POTS plain ordinary telephone system . Typically the network or Internet connection between carrier network and MSC transfers data and the POTS transfers voice information. MSC may be connected to multiple base stations BTS such as by at least one communications link including both a data network and or the Internet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. BTS ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless communications devices such as cellular telephones in an over the air protocol such as short messaging service SMS etc.

In the embodiment of each wireless device may include a computer platform that can receive and execute software applications and display data transmitted from computer system or other network servers . Computer platform may include an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other chipset processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. ASIC may be installed at the time of manufacture of wireless device . ASIC or other processor may execute an application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs e.g. CTC application in a memory of the wireless device. API is a runtime environment executing on the computing device or wireless device in this case. One such runtime environment is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW software although other runtime environments may be utilized that for example operate to control the execution of applications on wireless computing devices. Memory for example can be comprised of at least one of read only and random access memory RAM and ROM EPROM EEPROM flash cards and any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platform may also include a local database that can hold the software applications e.g. CTC application content content container files or data not actively used in memory . Local database may include at least one of flash memory cells magnetic media EPROM EEPROM optical media tape a soft disk a hard disk and any other type of secondary or tertiary memory. Thus in the embodiment of each wireless device may be loaded with applications such as CTC application content container content and or data from computer system in accordance with system .
