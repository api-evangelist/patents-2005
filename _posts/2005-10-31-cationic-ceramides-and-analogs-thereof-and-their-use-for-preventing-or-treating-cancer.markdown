The invention relates to cationic ceramides dihydro ceramides their analogs and their derivatives. The invention also relates to methods of making the compounds and various uses of the compounds such as the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with cell overproliferation and sphingolipid signal transduction.

Ceramide is a potent signal transducer that affects cell growth differentiation and death Hannun Y. A. 1996 274 1855 1859 Obeid L. M. Linardic C. M. Karolak L. A. and Hannun Y. A. 1993 259 1769 1771 Perry D. K. and Hannun Y. A. 1998 436 233 243 . It occupies a central position in sphingolipid metabolism. As an acceptor of carbohydrates phosphorylcholine and phosphate it serves as precursor of the various complex sphingolipids. Alternatively the enzymatic breakdown of these sphingolipids releases ceramide which may consequently be hydrolyzed into fatty acid and sphingosine the latter exerting effector functions on its own as well as acting as a precursor of sphingosine phosphate another signal mediator and regulator of various cell functions. Ceramides are generated by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin in response to different stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor Fas CD95 ligand interleukin 1 and vitamin D3. A controlled level of ceramide therefore reflects an intricate balance between the catabolic and anabolic pathways of ceramide.

One of the most studied effects of ceramide is the ability to induce cell death. Endogenous ceramide levels are elevated in tumors after irradiation or therapy with anticancer drugs Bose et al. 82 405 414 1995 Selzner et al. 61 1233 1240 2001 . Exogenous ceramides emerged as a promising new approach for cancer therapy. It has been shown that exogenous ceramide can induce cell death in a variety of cancer cell types with normal cells being less susceptible von Haefen et al. 21 4009 4019 2002 Jones et al. 30 215 222 1999 .

Most studies of the effects of ceramides on cancer cells are restricted to the use of short chain ceramides C C because naturally occurring long chain ceramides C C are unable to penetrate cell membranes. Mitochondria have been identified as a target of ceramides. However studies on the direct effect of ceramides on mitochondria are hampered by the fact that the ceramides are readily distributed to various organelles such as Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum Radin 11 2123 2142 2003 Ardail et al. 1583 305 310 2002 . Therefore there is great interest in ceramides that can enter a cancer cell and target itself to the mitochondria where it induces cell death. The present invention provides a class of ceramide conjugates which have these desirable pharmacological properties making these conjugates suitable for development as therapeutic agents or drug delivery vehicles.

Citation of references hereinabove shall not be construed as an admission that such references are prior art to the present invention.

The present invention provides ceramide conjugates with pyridinium salts and their analogs collectively herein referred to as CCPS analogs. The compounds of the invention are designed according to the concept of incorporating pyridinium salt moieties into the structure of ceramides to form a structurally distinct class of cationic lipids. The invention also provides methods for making CCPS analogs and methods for using these compounds for the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with cell overproliferation and sphingolipid signal transduction.

The present invention can be understood more fully by reference to the following detailed description and illustrative examples which exemplify non limiting embodiments of the invention.

The invention relates to hybrid sphingolipids and their analogs conjugated with a pyridinium salt specifically hybrid ceramides and analogs conjugated with pyridinium salt collectively referred to as CCPS analogs. The present invention also includes methods of designing methods of making and methods of using such cationic analogs.

In one embodiment the present invention provides compounds having Formula I or Formula II. The CCPS analogs have pyridinium cations incorporated into the N acyl parts as an substituent inside the N acyl chains or into the sphingosine or in general into the aminoalcohol backbone as an substituent. The CCPS analogs were designed to target ceramides or their analogs into negatively charged organelles such as mitochondria and nuclei and to decipher the NMR structure of natural ceramides under physiological conditions. As used herein the phrase CCPS analogs also includes the dihydrogenated analogs of CCPS dhCCPS analogs . Compounds encompassed by the invention are described in details in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. The terms CCPS analog and pyridinium ceramide and pyridinium ceramide analogs are used interchangeably to refer to the compounds of the invention. These compounds are generally known as ceramidoids.

In the course of investigation by the present inventors of chemical etiology of sphingolipis SPLs structure and their biological functions see Chalfant C E 2003 . 45 3 496 506 El Bawab S. 2002 43 141 148 Usta J 2001 . 40 32 9657 9668 and El Bavab 2000 276 16758 167 and search for new molecules that show desirable properties e.g. improved solubility and cellular uptake and directed targeting to the specific cellular compartments mimic action of natural SPLs and affect their metabolism novel SPL analogs bearing cations in the molecules are developed. Specifically the introduction of the pyridinium cation into the ceramide Cer structure can impose a controlled targeting and delivery of parent compounds into negatively charged cellular organelles such as mitochondria and nuclei.

According to the invention the design for the CCPS analogs is based on the following observations i some lipophilic cations were reported to localize preferentially into mitochondria ii much of the action in the mammalian apoptotic program takes place at the mitochondrial level iii Cer formation is intimately related to mitochondrial function in apoptosis and iv the acute accumulation of Cer both directly and indirectly profoundly affects mitochondrial function see Davis S 1985 260 13844 13850 Modica Napolitano J S. 2001 49 63 70 Fantin V. R. 2002 2 29 42 Rosania G. R. 2003 125 1130 1131 Grether Beck S. 2003 48 47498 47507 Siskind L. J. . 2002 277 26796 26803 Bribes H. et al 2001 14 2669 2679 Mimeault M. 2002 530 9 16 Radin N. C. 2003 11 2123 2142 . The CCPS analogs which include water soluble Cers can be delivered to the cells and serve as model compounds to study behavior and apoptotic action of natural Cers under physiological conditions in the context of mitochondrial damage see Di Paola 2000 39 6660 6668 Bribes H. et al 2001 14 2669 2679 Szalai G. 1999 18 6349 6361 

In one embodiment the present invention encompasses a structurally distinct class of hybrid cationic Cers the CCPS analogs that incorporate pyridinium salt moieties PSM into the N acyl part of the Cer structure at three distinct locations . Compounds of Class A and D represents analogs possessing the PSM unit as a tether in the N acyl part of the conjugated molecule Compounds of Class B represent analogs where the PSM unit is either in the vicinal or the juxta position to the N carbonyl group of the conjugated molecule and Compounds of Class C represents analogs possessing the PSM unit as a tether in sphingosine backbone. The location of the PSM unit plays an important role for the physicochemical biophysical and biological properties of these developed analogs. The arrangements of the PSM unit found in the structure of a naturally occurring trimeric pyridinium alkaloid viscosamine was used here as a model template see Volke Ch. A. 2003 5 3567 3569 

The varied structural and stereochemical examples of exemplary CCPS analogs of the invention are shown in Schemes 1 2 and 3 see B see Section 5.4.1 . These exemplary compounds serve as model compounds to study structure function relationship of this group of compounds. These selected CCPS analogs establish effects of specific structural modifications i chain length in N acyl part C C Cand Chomologs ii stereochemistry at Cand Cpositions of sphingoid backbone isomers 2S 3R 2S 3S 2R 3S and 2R 2R iii saturation desaturation of C4 C5 positions of sphingoid backbone and iv location and substitution of pyridine moiety on physicochemical properties and biological activity of these newly synthesized analogs of Cer.

In another embodiment fluorescent CCPS analog such as 2S 3R 4E 2 N 6 1 4 N N dimethylaminostyryl pyridinium hexanoyl sphingosine bromide LCL 186 which contains a pyridinium ring connected to another aromatic ring via a vinyl linker are encompassed. This combination generates fluorescence due to the presence of 10 electron conjugated systems and suggests that LCL 186 can be used as advanced photonic molecules see Klymchenko A. S. 2003 100 20 11219 11224 .

In various embodiments exemplary short C and C and long chain C and C D erythro pyridinium ceramide bromides relating to Compounds of Class A LCL 150 LCL 29 LCL 88 and LCL 30 their representative dihydro analogs LCL 319 LCL 143 LCL 249 and LCL 319 the remaining stereoisomers of C homolog LCL 124 LCL 187 and LCL 272 L threo diastereoisomer of C homolog LCL 87 fluorescent analog LCL 186 were synthesized. Exemplary D erythro analogs relating to Compounds of Class B LCL 275 and LCL 277 were also synthesized.

The CCPS analogs have enhanced water solubility and cellular uptake and are resistant to acid and base hydrolysis under extreme physiological conditions. Dynamic NMR studies showed that incorporation of the pyridinium moiety into the hydrophobic interface of class A of CCPSs did not change the conformational preferences in their polar interface.

In another embodiment the invention provides the uses of CCPS analogs to prevent or treat in a subject various conditions involving cell overproliferation or sphingolipid signal transduction in particular cancer. The use of these compounds as pharmaceutical compounds are described in details in section 5.5. Uses of these compounds in combination with other therapeutic agents are also contemplated. Related pharmaceutical compositions and formulations are described in details in section 5.6.

As one of the non limiting objectives of the invention is to create a library of compounds that have tunable physicochemical properties the present inventors show in Section 9 that CCPS analogs accumulate in the mitochondria after entering cells. Accordingly in one embodiment these CCPS analogs can be used to as a targeting agent for delivery of a molecular cargo to cells and to the mitochondria in particular. In one embodiment the cargo is conjugated to a CCPS analog of the invention. In other embodiments the CCPS analogs of the invention can be used as a component of micelles cationic liposomes or artificial membranes. The CCPS analogs can be used as a delivery vehicle for a variety of cargo molecules such as but not limited to hydrophobic drugs therapeutic nucleic acids antisense molecules RNAi molecules etc. Accordingly the invention provides a method for targeting a cargo molecule to mitochondria comprising forming a delivery complex of the cargo molecule with a CCPS analog of the invention and administering the delivery complex to a subject or a cell. In an embodiment the delivery complex comprises a CCPS analog and a cargo molecule wherein the cargo molecule is covalently linked to the CCPS analog. In another embodiment the delivery complex is a micelle or a liposome that comprises one or more different CCPS analogs and a cargo molecule. Many methods well known in the art can be used to form liposomes comprising CCPS analogs see for example D. D. Lasic Liposomes in Gene Delivery CRC Press 1997.

In another embodiment these compounds can be used as molecular probes to investigate signal transduction sphingolipid metabolism glycerolipid metabolism in organelles such as but not limited to studies in vitro in vivo in cells in isolated organelles. For example the fluorescent analog LCL 186 bearing N N dimethylaminostyryl substituent in the pyridinium moiety was synthesized to monitor intracellular localization of this class of compounds by normal and or confocal microscopy. Preferably the organelle is mitochondria.

The present invention also provide methods for making CCPS analogs. The compounds of formula I Compounds of Classes A B and D can be made using conventional organic syntheses and or by the following illustrative methods depicted in Schemes 1 2 and 3 below. As depicted two parallel approaches based upon the use of known protocols reported previously for the preparation of Cers from sphingoid bases 1a d obtained in stereocontrolled synthesis from the Gamer s aldehydes see Garner 53 4395 4398 1988 Ninkar S. 29 3037 3040 1988 Herold P. E. 71 354 362 1988 Bielawska A. et al. 311 518 535 1999 Usta J. et al. 2001 . 40 32 9657 9668 and pyridinium salts from pyridine derivatives see Cherioux F. 10 1984 1989 1998 Kloc K 57 1506 1979 .

CCPS analogs of Class A CPPS Analogs of Class A can be prepared by N acylation of 1a e with varied chain bromo acid chlorides. The reaction is carried out under two phase based conditions 50 aqueous sol. of CHCOONa THF and preceded very quickly 15 25 min with complete consumption of sphingoid bases to give bromo Cers 2a l in high yields vide infra . One method for making the long chains bromo Cers 2i and 2j involves the condensation of 1a with the activated forms of the corresponding C12 or C16 FAs i.e NHS esters Imd derivatives etc. synthesized separately or generated in situ to provide 2i and 2j in yields of up to about 50 the yield being hindered due to low reaction rate and complex mixtures formation. Subsequent quaternization of pyridine or its 4 N N dimethylaminostyryl derivative see Cherioux F. 10 1984 1989 1998 with the formed bromo Cers 2a l is then carried out in toluene solution at 75 80 C. to provide the pyridinium bromides LCL 29 30 88 89 124 143 150 186 187 249 272 319 and 345 respectively.

CCPS analogs of Class D CCPS analogs of class D can be prepared in a manner similar to that described in Scheme 3 by reacting compounds of formula A for phenylaminoalcohols 2 amino phenyl 1 3 dihydroxy or 1 or 3 nomohydroxy 

CCPS analogs of Class B In order to prepare CCPS analogs of class B the pyridine moiety has to be introduced first into the SPL structure following its further quaternization with the selected alkyl halide. Thus the N acylation of 1a with 3 pyridinepropionic or nicotinic acid chlorides gave pyridino Cers 3 and 4 which were easily N alkylated in the next step with n butyl or n octyl bromides to give LCL 275 and 277 respectively Scheme 2 . The key intermediates 2a l 3 and 4 as well as the final products were easily purified by flash column chromatography or by recrystallization where appropriate.

The above described two step general synthetic approach revealed to be fast and amenable for scaling up to a practical process which provides the CCPS analogs in good to excellent overall yields 40 85 . Finally that strategy opens unrestricted access to structurally varied CCPS analogs having modified N acyl parts as well as based on the complex hybrid SPLs phospho and glyco SPLs .

All synthesized CCPS analogs were fully characterized by spectroscopic methods mass spectroscopy MS nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy optical rotation and elemental analysis. Stability studies of LCL 29 30 88 and 150 by MS analysis performed under aqueous conditions at pH 4.5 7.5 and 8.5 over the period of 48 hrs find no evidence of their decomposition.

Non limiting examples of useful leaving group include Cl Br I Si C C alkyl tosylate trifluoromethanesulfonate methanesulfonate and the like. In one embodiment L is Br. In another embodiment L becomes M.

In another embodiment the invention relates to methods for making a compound of formula I comprising 

CCPS analogs of Class C CPPS Analogs of Class C of general structure of Formula II shown in can be prepared as depicted in Scheme 4 . Description of the general synthesis of Class C compounds and exemplary compounds are shown in Section 6 Example 31 infra.

The present invention provides the uses of CCPS analogs of the invention for treatment and or prophylaxis of various diseases and disorders related to cell proliferation and or sphingolipid signal transduction in a subject.

Ceramide modulates a number of biochemical and cellular responses to stress including apoptosis cell cycle arrest and cell senescence. For review see Hannun et al. 2000 Trends in Cell Biol. 10 73 80 Mathias et al. 1998 Biochem. J. 335 465 480 . Several extracellular agents and stress stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor chemotherapeutic agents and heat are known to cause ceramide accumulation. One approach to cause accumulation of ceramide is accomplished by regulating the activities of enzymes such as ceramidase which is involved in the metabolism of ceramide. The changes in the ceramide concentration are sufficient to reproduce many of the biological effects of cytokines and stress inducers that are coupled to ceramide accumulation. The accumulation of ceramides also reproduce many of the features of cell senescence. In many cell types ceramides cause cell differentiation both morphologically and through the activation of biochemical programs of cell differentiation. Ceramide also causes apoptosis in most cancer cells which can be accompanied by cell cycle arrest. Furthermore there is evidence which suggests that ceramide is closely associated with TNF induced apoptosis. Thus according to the present invention modulation of the levels of ceramide or sphingosine through the methods of the present invention can bring about treatment and prevention of diseases that are related to stress response and apoptosis. Several exemplary diseases and disorders are disclosed below which may be treated or prevented by the methods of the present invention. The compounds can also be used for management or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with these diseases.

Without being bound by any theories the CCPS analogs modulate sphingolipid components and act as a modulator of sphingolipid enzymes that are present in a cell or in organelles of a cell. The CCPS analogs may also act by inhibiting telomerase as it has been shown that inhibition of telomerase by ceramide is mainly linked to rapid degradation of c Myc via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. The CCPS analogs may also act by altering permeability of the inner and or outer membranes. Regardless of the underlying mechanism s in various embodiments the CCPS analogs can induce cell death in vitro and in vivo.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a method of increasing the level of ceramide and for changing ceramide composition in a cell comprising contacting the cell with one or more CCPS analogs. In a related embodiment at least one of the CCPS analog modulates a ceramidase activity in the cell.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method of inhibiting the formation of sphingosine in a cell comprising contacting the cell with one or more CCPS analogs such that the amount of sphingosine formed as a result of conversion from ceramide is reduced.

In yet another embodiment the invention provides a method of increasing the intracellular levels of ceramide in an animal comprising administering to the animal one or more CCPS analogs.

In yet another embodiment the invention provides a method of increasing the intracellular levels of ceramide in an animal comprising administering to the animal an effective amount of one or more CCPS analogs that inhibit the ceramidase activity of a ceramidase protein in the animal s cells.

In yet another embodiment the invention provides a method of inhibiting the intracellular formation of sphingosine in an animal comprising administering to said animal an effective amount of one or more CCPS analogs. Preferably at least one of the CCPS analogs inhibit the ceramidase activity of the ceramidase protein in the animal s cells.

In yet another embodiment the invention provides a method of inhibiting the activity of telomerase or the activity of proteins that act on the same pathway as telomerase in sustaining cancer cell proliferation. The invention also provides a method of inhibiting cell proliferation and particularly arresting cancer cell growth at G0 G1.

In yet another embodiment the invention provides a method of increasing the permeability of mitochondrial inner membrane comprising contacting a cell comprising mitochondria with a CCPS analog of the invention. Also encompassed are a method for activating an ion transporter in mitochondria which results in an alteration in the permeability of mitochondria membrane and a method for releasing mitochondrial cytochrome c.

In specific embodiments one or more different CCPS analogs can be administered to a subject in need of a CCPS analog therapeutically or prophylactically 1 in diseases or disorders of which treatment involves cell death such as apoptosis 2 in diseases or disorders wherein in vitro or in vivo assays indicate the utility of ceramide administration or 3 in diseases or disorders involving an increased relative to normal or desired level of ceramidase protein or function for example in patients where ceramidase protein is biologically overactive or overexpressed.

The increased level in ceramidase protein or function can be readily detected e.g. by obtaining a patient tissue sample e.g. from biopsy tissue and assaying it in vitro for RNA or protein levels structure and or activity of one or more of the expressed ceramidase RNAs or proteins. Many methods standard in the art can be thus employed including but not limited to ceramidase enzyme assays immunoassays to detect and or visualize one or more of different ceramidase proteins e.g. Western blot immunoprecipitation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunocytochemistry etc. and or hybridization assays to detect ceramidase expression by detecting and or visualizing specific ceramidase mRNA e.g. Northern assays dot blots in situ hybridization etc. etc.

According to the invention disorders involving cell hyperproliferation or dysfunctional sphingolipid signal transduction are treated or prevented by administration of a compound to a subject that inhibits ceramidase function. These diseases and disorders include but are not limited to diseases or disorders related to cell proliferation cell attachment cell immigration granulation tissue development primary and metastatic neoplastic diseases inflammation cardiovascular disease stroke ischemia or atherosclerosis. Diseases and disorders involving cell overproliferation that can be treated or prevented include but are not limited to cancers premalignant conditions e.g. hyperplasia metaplasia dysplasia benign tumors hyperproliferative disorders and benign dysproliferative disorders. Cancer is characterized primarily by an increase in the number of abnormal cells derived from a given normal tissue invasion of adjacent tissues by these abnormal cells and lymphatic or blood borne. Malignancies and related disorders that can be treated prevented managed amerliorated particularly metastatic cancer by administration of a compound of the invention that inhibits ceramidase function as discussed below for a review of such disorders see Fishman et al. 1985 2d Ed. J.B. Lippincott Co. Philadelphia 

In another embodiment disorders in which cell proliferation is deficient or is desired can be treated or prevented by administration of a CCPS analog to a subject that promotes ceramidase function or mimics the result of ceramidase function.

The CCPS analogs can also be administered to treat premalignant conditions and to prevent progression to a neoplastic or malignant state. Such prophylactic or therapeutic use is indicated in conditions known or suspected of preceding progression to neoplasia or cancer in particular where non neoplastic cell growth consisting of hyperplasia metaplasia or most particularly dysplasia has occurred for review of such abnormal growth conditions see Robbins and Angell 1976 2d Ed. W.B. Saunders Co. Philadelphia pp. 68 79. 

Alternatively or in addition to the presence of abnormal cell growth characterized as hyperplasia metaplasia or dysplasia the presence of one or more characteristics of a transformed phenotype or of a malignant phenotype displayed in vivo or displayed in vitro by a cell sample from a patient can indicate the desirability of prophylactic therapeutic administration of a compound that inhibits ceramidase function. Such characteristics of a transformed phenotype include morphology changes looser substratum attachment loss of contact inhibition loss of anchorage dependence protease release increased sugar transport decreased serum requirement expression of fetal antigens etc.

Other disorders of proliferation that may benefit from the use of CCPS analog include cardiovascular diseases. Vascular interventions including angioplasty stenting atherectomy and grafting for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases are often complicated by undesirable effects. One of the adverse reactions to vascular intervention include endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation which can lead to hyperplasia or more specifically restenosis occlusion of blood vessels reperfusion injury platelet aggregation and calcification. In this model an injurious stimulus induces expression of growth stimulatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor. Libby et al. 1992 Circulation 86 6 III 47 III52. There is evidence which shows that ceramide inhibit the growth of endothelia and smooth muscle cells of the coronary artery.

Various therapies have been attempted to treat or prevent restenosis. However there remains a great need for therapies directed to the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases caused by hyperplasia of endothelia and smooth muscle cells. Since it has been shown that ceramide inhibit the growth of endothelia and smooth muscle cells of the coronary artery it is therefore desirable to raise the level of ceramide for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Recently Kester et al. show that ceramide used in angioplasty prevents restenosis. Kester et al. 2000 Circ. Res. 87 4 282 8. Alternative and more effectively one aspect of the present invention provides treatment and prevention of restenosis by adjusting the level of ceramide through administering one or more CCPS analog.

Accordingly it is therefore desirable to raise the level of ceramide for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This can be accomplished by adjusting the intracellular level of ceramide by using the compounds and methods of the invention. The outcome of a treatment is to at least produce in a treated subject a healthful benefit which in the case of cardiovascular diseases includes but is not limited to a reduced risk of re clogging of arteries after a vascular intervention procedure and improved circulation.

In a specific embodiment the present invention provides a method for preventing treating managing or ameliorating an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder or one or more symptoms thereof said method comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of CCPS analog and a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of one or more immunomodulatory agents.

Interleukin 1 is a major inducer of inflammation and TNF is an important regulator of the reaction. Both cytokines can activate ceramidase and thus inhibiting the activity of ceramidase can result in an anti inflammatory effect. This may involve the prevention of the formation of sphingosine and sphingosine phosphate which have pro inflammatory effects. Also inhibition of ceramidase may prevent the hyperproliferation of immune cells that are important for inflammation. There is evidence which suggests that an increase in ceramide and a decrease in sphingosine leads to a decrease in sphingosine phosphate. Preliminary data show that in mouse fibroblast cells L929 TNF increases the level of ceramide and leads to PGE2 release from these cells. The release of PGE2 is also shown to be inhibited by D N myristolyamino 1 phenyl 1 propanol D MAPP which is an inhibitor of one of the ceramidase. This observation may be important for inhibiting inflammatory reactions that occur in conditions such as but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis. Thus it is possible to treat or prevent inflammation by regulating the level of cellular ceramide using the method of the invention. As discussed above ceramide level can be increased by administering compounds of the present invention that can inhibit mitochondrial ceramidase.

Examples of autoimmune disorders include but are not limited to alopecia areata ankylosing spondylitis antiphospholipid syndrome autoimmune Addison s disease autoimmune diseases of the adrenal gland autoimmune hemolytic anemia autoimmune hepatitis autoimmune oophoritis and orchitis autoimmune thrombocytopenia Behcet s disease bullous pemphigoid cardiomyopathy celiac sprue dermatitis chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome CFIDS chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy Churg Strauss syndrome cicatrical pemphigoid CREST syndrome cold agglutinin disease Crohn s disease discoid lupus essential mixed cryoglobulinemia fibromyalgia fibromyositis glomerulonephritis Graves disease Guillain Barre Hashimoto s thyroiditis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura ITP IgA neuropathy juvenile arthritis lichen planus lupus erthematosus M ni re s disease mixed connective tissue disease multiple sclerosis type 1 or immune mediated diabetes mellitus myasthenia gravis pemphigus vulgaris pernicious anemia polyarteritis nodosa polychrondritis polyglandular syndromes polymyalgia rheumatica polymyositis and dermatomyositis primary agammaglobulinemia primary biliary cirrhosis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis Raynauld s phenomenon Reiter s syndrome Rheumatoid arthritis sarcoidosis scleroderma Sj gren s syndrome stiff man syndrome systemic lupus erythematosus lupus erythematosus takayasu arteritis temporal arteristis giant cell arteritis ulcerative colitis uveitis vasculitides such as dermatitis herpetiformis vasculitis vitiligo and Wegener s granulomatosis. Examples of inflammatory disorders include but are not limited to asthma encephilitis inflammatory bowel disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD allergic disorders septic shock pulmonary fibrosis undifferentitated spondyloarthropathy undifferentiated arthropathy arthritis inflammatory osteolysis and chronic inflammation resulting from chronic viral or bacteria infections. Some autoimmune disorders are associated with an inflammatory condition. Thus there is overlap between what is considered an autoimmune disorder and an inflammatory disorder. Therefore some autoimmune disorders may also be characterized as inflammatory disorders.

The present invention provides methods of preventing treating managing or ameliorating an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder or one or more symptoms thereof said methods comprising administering to a subject in need of a CCPS analog and one or more immunomodulatory agents. Preferably the immunomodulatory agents are not administered to a subject with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder whose mean absolute lymphocyte count is less than 500 cells mm less than 550 cells mm less than 600 cells mm less than 650 cells mm less than 700 cells mm less than 750 cells mm less than 800 cells mm less than 850 cells mmor less than 900 cells mm. Thus in a preferred embodiment prior to or subsequent to the administration of one or more dosages of one or more immunomodulatory agents to a subject with an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder the absolute lymphocyte count of said subject is determined by techniques well known to one of skill in the art including e.g. flow cytometry or trypan blue counts.

Examples of immunomodulatory agents include but are not limited to methothrexate leflunomide cyclophosphamide cyclosporine A and macrolide antibiotics e.g. FK506 tacrolimus methylprednisolone MP corticosteroids steriods mycophenolate mofetil rapamycin sirolimus mizoribine deoxyspergualin brequinar malononitriloamindes e.g. leflunamide T cell receptor modulators and cytokine receptor modulators. Examples of T cell receptor modulators include but are not limited to anti T cell receptor antibodies e.g. anti CD4 monoclonal antibodies anti CD3 monoclonal antibodies anti CD8 monoclonal antibodies anti CD40 ligand monoclonal antibodies anti CD2 monoclonal antibodies and CTLA4 immunoglobulin. Examples of cytokine receptor modulators include but are not limited to soluble cytokine receptors e.g. the extracellular domain of a TNF receptor or a fragment thereof the extracellular domain of an IL 1 receptor or a fragment thereof and the extracellular domain of an IL 6 receptor or a fragment thereof cytokines or fragments thereof e.g. interleukin IL 2 IL 3 IL 4 IL 5 IL 6 IL 7 IL 8 IL 9 IL 10 IL 11 IL 12 IL 15 TNF TNF interferon IFN IFN IFN and GM CSF anti cytokine receptor antibodies e.g. anti IL 2 receptor antibodies anti IL 4 receptor antibodies anti IL 6 receptor antibodies anti IL 10 receptor antibodies and anti IL 12 receptor antibodies anti cytokine antibodies e.g. anti IFN receptor antibodies anti TNF antibodies anti IL 1 antibodies anti IL 6 antibodies and anti IL 12 antibodies .

Anti inflammatory agents have exhibited success in treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and are now a common and a standard treatment for such disorders. Any anti inflammatory agent well known to one of skill in the art can be used in the compositions and methods of the invention. Non limiting examples of anti inflammatory agents include non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs steroidal anti inflammatory drugs beta agonists anticholingeric agents and methyl xanthines. Examples of NSAIDs include but are not limited to aspirin ibuprofen celecoxib CELEBREX diclofenac VOLTAREN etodolac LODINE fenoprofen NALFON indomethacin INDOCIN ketoralac TORADOL oxaprozin DAYPRO nabumentone RELAFEN sulindac CLINORIL tolmentin TOLECTIN rofecoxib VIOXX naproxen ALEVE NAPROSYN ketoprofen ACTRON and nabumetone RELAFEN . Such NSAIDs function by inhibiting a cyclooxgenase enzyme e.g. COX 1 and or COX 2 . Examples of steroidal anti inflammatory drugs include but are not limited to glucocorticoids dexamethasone DECADRON cortisone hydrocortisone prednisone DELTASONE prednisolone triamcinolone azulfidine and eicosanoids such as prostaglandins thromboxanes and leukotrienes.

Techniques for the determination of effective doses and administration of such compounds are described in Section 5.5. Any technique which serves to selectively administer chemicals to a cell population of interest can be used for example by using a delivery complex. Such a delivery complex can comprise an appropriate chemical and a targeting means. Such targeting means can comprise for example sterols lipids viruses or target cell specific binding agents.

The CCPS analogs described herein can be administered to a patient at therapeutically effective doses to treat or prevent diseases and disorder discussed above. A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of a compound sufficient to result in a healthful benefit in the treated subject. See the 53ed. 1999 .

The subject to which a compound of the invention is administered is preferably an animal including but not limited to mammal such as non primate e.g. cows pigs horses chickens cats dogs rats etc. and a primate e.g. monkey such as acynomolgous monkey and a human. In a preferred embodiment the subject is a human. The compound of the invention can be utilized for the prevention of a variety of cancers e.g. in individuals who are predisposed as a result of familial history or in individuals with an enhanced risk to cancer due to environmental factors such as smoking viral infection.

The methods and compositions of the invention may be used in patients who are treatment naive in patients who have previously received or are currently receiving treatment with other pharmaceutical agents or combinations including but not limited to anti cancer agents. Other subjects may include patients that have metastasis or no metastasis.

The methods and compositions of the invention are useful not only in untreated patients but are also useful in the treatment of patients partially or completely un responsive to other treatments. In various embodiments the invention provides methods and compositions useful for the treatment of diseases or disorders in patients that have been shown to be or may be refractory or non responsive to therapies comprising the administration of other agents.

The compound of the invention can also be administered to an animal preferably a mammal such as farm animals and pets to treat prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with the disease disorder or infection as discussed in Section 5.3.

Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of CCPS analogs can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD ED. Compounds which exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While compounds that exhibit toxic side effects can be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such compounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and thereby reduce side effects.

The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. For example the dosage can range from 10 nM to 100 M and preferably 1 to 10 M. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any compound used in the method of the invention the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC i.e. the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma can be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography.

Suitable daily doses for the treatment or prevention of a disorder described herein can be readily determined by those skilled in the art. A recommended dose of a compound of the invention is from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per day given as a single once a day dose in the morning or as divided doses throughout the day. Preferably a daily dose is from about 2 mg to about 25 mg per day more preferably from about 5 mg to about 10 mg per day.

The anti cancer activity of the therapies used in accordance with the present invention also can be determined by using various experimental animal models of such as cancer animal models such as scid mouse model or nude mice with human tumor grafts known in the art and described in Yamanaka 2001 Microbiol Immunol 2001 45 7 507 14.

The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. For example in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific therapeutic protocol is indicated include in vitro cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture and exposed to or otherwise administered a protocol and the effect of such protocol upon the tissue sample is observed. A lower level of proliferation or survival of the contacted cells indicates that the compound is effective to treat the condition in the patient. Alternatively instead of culturing cells from a patient the compounds may be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival and or growth for example cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring H thymidine incorporation by direct cell count by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known genes such as proto oncogenes e.g. fos myc or cell cycle markers cell viability can be assessed by trypan blue staining differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes in morphology etc.

Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to testing in humans including but not limited to in rats mice chicken cows monkeys rabbits etc. The principle animal models for cancer known in the art and widely used include mice all described in Hann et al. 2001 Curr Opin Cell Biol 2001 13 6 778 84 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Further any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for treatment prophylaxis management or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with the disease disorder as described in Section 5.5.

Efficacy in treating inflammatory disorders may be demonstrated by detecting the ability of the CCPS analogs of the present invention or a composition of the invention to reduce or inhibit the inflammation in an animal or to ameliorate or alleviate one or more symptoms associated with an inflammatory disorder. The treatment is considered therapeutic if there is for example a reduction is in inflammation or amelioration of one or more symptoms following administration of the CCPS analog or a composition of the invention.

Various methods can be used to administer a CCPS analog of the invention. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal intramuscular intraperitoneal intravenous subcutaneous intranasal epidural inhalation insufflation either through the mouth or the nose oral buccal or rectal routes. The compounds may be administered by any convenient route for example by infusion or bolus injection by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings e.g. oral mucosa rectal and intestinal mucosa etc. and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route including intraventricular and intrathecal injection intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter for example attached to a reservoir such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed e.g. by use of an inhaler or nebulizer and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.

In a specific embodiment it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment this may be achieved by for example and not by way of limitation local infusion during surgery by means of a catheter by means of a suppository or by means of an implant said implant being of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes such as sialastic membranes or fibers.

The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant excipient or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders sustained release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the cationic pyridinium ceramides preferably in purified form together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.

In a preferred embodiment the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form for example as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.

The CCPS analogs of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with free amino groups such as those derived from hydrochloric phosphoric acetic oxalic tartaric acids etc. and those formed with free carboxyl groups such as those derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium ferric hydroxides isopropylamine triethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine etc.

The amount of CCPS analog of the invention which will be effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition will depend on the nature of the disorder or condition and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition in vitro assays and animal models may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the disease or disorder and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances.

Suppositories generally contain active ingredient in the range of 0.5 to 10 by weight oral formulations preferably contain 10 to 95 active ingredient.

The invention also provides a pack or kit for therapeutic use comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container s can be an instruction sheet and or a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture use or sale of pharmaceuticals or diagnostic products which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture use or sale for human administration.

Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention can be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients.

For oral administration the pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of for example tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents e.g. pregelatinised maize starch polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose fillers e.g. lactose microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate talc or silica disintegrants e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycolate or wetting agents e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate . The tablets can be coated by methods well known in the art. Liquid preparations for oral administration can take the form of for example solutions syrups or suspensions or they can be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents e.g. sorbitol syrup cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats emulsifying agents e.g. lecithin or acacia non aqueous vehicles e.g. almond oil oily esters ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable oils and preservatives e.g. methyl or propyl p hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid . The preparations can also contain buffer salts flavoring coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate.

Preparations for oral administration can be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.

For buccal administration the compositions can take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.

For administration by inhalation the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane trichlorofluoromethane dichlorotetrafluoroethane carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit can be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.

The compounds can be formulated for parenteral administration i.e. intravenous or intramuscular by injection via for example bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as suspensions solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending stabilizing and or dispersing agents. Alternatively the active ingredient can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle e.g. sterile pyrogen free water before use.

The compounds can also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.

In addition to the formulations described previously the compounds can also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly or by intramuscular injection. Thus for example the compounds can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil or ion exchange resins or as sparingly soluble derivatives for example as a sparingly soluble salt.

General directions CCPS analogs class C can be synthesized from ceramides or their congeners and bromo 1 alkenes via the olefin cross metathesis reaction following cationization of the formed bromo ceramides with pyridine as shown in Scheme 4 Trnka T. M. Grubbs R. H. 2001 34 18 29 Nussbaumer P. Ettmayer P. Carsten P. Rosenbeiger D H genauer K. 2005 40 5086 5087 .

Synthesis of LCL438 is shown as an example.

In the second step the formed intermediate D erythro 2 N hexadecanoyl 14 bromo sphingosine was condensed with pyridine in a similar fashion as described for the preparation of the class A and B of CCPS analogs.

Cell Culture MCF7 cells breast adenocarcinoma pleural effusion were purchased from American type Culture Collection ATCC Rockville Md. USA and grown in RPMI 1640 media Life Technologies Inc supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum FCS Summit Biotechnology CO and maintained under standard incubator conditions humidified atmosphere 95 air 5 CO37 C. . A parallel set of cells was used to determine cell proliferation and to prepare lipid extracts for MS analysis.

Cell Proliferation Cells were seeded into plates at a density of approx. 50 corresponding to 1 10cells in 10 ml of 10 FCS and after an over night incubation the cells were treated with LCL compounds at concentration 0 20 M in ethanol ethanol level was kept below 0.1 and the changes in cell numbers after 48 h were determined and expressed as a percentage of the untreated controls.

Briefly media was removed cells were washed twice with PBS detached using 1 Trypsin and centrifuged at 800 rpm. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and Trypan blue Sigma Chemicals St. Louis Mo. USA was added 1 1 dilution . Under light microscope the percentage of unstained and stained cells was assessed.

Endogenous ceramide ESI MS MS analysis of endogenous sphingoid bases sphingoid base 1 phosphates and ceramide species was performed on a Thermo Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operating in a Multiple Reaction Monitoring MRM positive ionization mode using modified version Bielawski J. et al. SERMACS 2003 poster 68 of the protocol previously published Sullard M. C. Merrill A. H. Sciences stke 2001 67 p 11 .

Briefly for the indicated points media was removed cells were washed twice with PBS scraped into cold PBS 2 1.0 ml transferred to glass vials and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 rpm. Cell pellets corresponding to 1 10cells were fortified with the internal standards IS Cbase D erythro sphingosine 17Sph Csphingosine 1 phosphate 17Sph 1P N palmitoyl D erythro Csphingosine 13CC16 Cer and N heptadecanoyl D erythro Cshingosine 17CC17 Cer and extracted 2 2 ml into a one phase solvent system with ethyl acetate iso propanol water 60 30 10 v v . One ml of this extract was used for Pi determination after lipid re extraction by the Bligh and Dyer method. Remaining lipid extract was evaporated reconstituted in 100 l of methanol and samples were injected on the Surveyor TSQ 7000 LC MS system and gradient eluted from the BDS Hypersil C8 150 3.2 mm 3 m particle size column with 1.0 mM methanolic ammonium formate 2 mM aqueous ammonium formate mobile phase system.

Final data were adjusted and results were expressed as level of particular sphingolipids Pi pmol nmol .

Cellular level of CCPS analogs was established by MS methodology. Experimental data from cell treatment with 5 M concentration of CCPS analogs over the time showed a very fast cellular uptake for CCPSs and dhCCPSs. Intracellular level of these analogs after 15 min of treatment was established as 2 3 concentration applied 500 750 pmols with a progressive increase of 7.5 12 for 1 h treatment and . At this time the level of pyr dh C ceramide LCL143 went up to 15 and was twice higher than for pyr C ceramide LCL29 . The cellular level of CCPS analogs was increasing up to 5 h reaching 17 for C Cand Chomologs LC129 30 and 150 and 23 for C12 ceramide LCL88 . When treatment time was extended to 24 h differences in cellular level of the short chain and long chain homologs were noticed. Levels of LCL150 and LCL29 were continuously increased up to 24 h reaching 50 and 32 for Cand Chomologs respectively whereas the levels of Cand C homolgs at 24 h were similar to that for 5 h treatment.

Cellular levels of dihydro analogs were also time and chain length dependent. The cellular level of short chain homologs was permanently increased reaching 13 and 27 at 5 h and 35 and 52 at 24 h for Cand Chomologs respectively LCL143 and LCL319 whereas cellular levels of long chain dihydro homologs did not change with the time showing comparable levels for 5 and 24 h treatments.

Comparison of the cellular levels of the parallel pairs of CCPS and dhCCPS showed that the short chain analogs are on a similar level whereas the long chain CCPSs are present at a higher level than their dihydro partners 17 versus 4 and 23 versus 7 for 5 h treatment LCL345 LCL30 and LCL148 LCL88 respectively . Further investigation showed that dihydro CCPS analogs were metabolized to the corresponding CCPS analogs.

To examine the anticancer activity of CCPS analogs of the invention their inhibitory effect on MCF7 breast carcinoma cells were analyzed and compared to the activity of D e C ceramide which is commonly used as a model of action for ceramides. Cell proliferation and cell viability were determined by Trypan blue exclusion assay. Dose and time dependent effects on cell growth induced by incubation with CCPS analogs are shown in .

As shown in all tested D erythro Cn pyridinium ceramide bromides C C showed an inhibitory effect on cell growth as established for 48 h treatment with the following ICvalues M 8.0 C2 cer 1.0 C6 cer 0.6 C12 cer and 1.6 C cer. Regular D e C ceramide was the least potent compound only 35 inhibition for 10 M treatment . At 1.0 M concentration the most effective was pyridinium C12 homolog LCL88 and the least potent was C2 homolog LCL150 . Some inhibitory effect 20 30 was already observed for 0.2 M C12 C and C homologs. We have noticed remarkable differences in the activity profile between C and C homologs. Pyridinium C ceramide bromide LCL 30 showed a systematic dose dependent inhibitory effect on cell growth from 0.2 10.0 M being at concentration of 5 M more potent than C homolog LCL 29. LCL29 was very potent at concentration 0.1 1.0 M. When concentration was increased up to 10 M we did not find any further drastic changes. This observation may suggest a different mechanism of action for the short and the long chain ceramides.

Effect of D erythro dihydroCCPS analogs on cell growth was also investigated . D erythro dihydroceramides are known as biologically inactive compounds as was shown for C and C analogs ref . C C and C dhCCPS homologs LCL345 249 143 showed a concentration dependent inhibitory effect on cell growth but with a lower potency as compared to their 4 5 unsaturated counterparts LCL 30 88 29 . IC50 values M for 48 h treatment were as follow 2.5 LCL345 2.5 LCL249 and 5.0 LCL143. C2 homolog LCL319 had low activity only 15 inhibitory effect was observed for 10 M treatment.

Stereospecific effect of C CCPS analogs is shown in . All tested stereoisomers LCL 29 124 187 and 272 caused inhibitory effect on MCF7 cell growth with the 2S isomers LCL 29 124 being more potent than their 2R enantiomers LCL 187 272 . A similar stereo profile was observed for the parent C ceramides in HL 60 cell.

 2S diastereoisomers of C16 CCPS D erythro LCL 30 and L threo LCL 87 had a similar concentration dependent 1.0 10.0 M inhibitory effect on cell growth at 48 h and a time dependent antiproliferative effect for 2 M or 1.5 M treatment over a 0 72 h time period.

The inhibitory effect on cell growth of LCL 275 and 277 CCPS analogs representing class B is shown in . Considering the length of their N acyl part LCL 275 and LCL 277 are C12 and C10 homologs and can be treated as close analogs of LCL 88. Considering a placement of pyridinium ring into the or position to the carbonyl group these analogs can be treated as analogs of LCL 150 where pyridinium ring is at the position to the carbonyl group. Neither LCL275 nor LCL277 followed the activity pattern of LCL88 rather their activity can be compared to the effect of LCL150. The inhibitory effect was observed at higher concentration IC50 values are 8.5 M LCL277 and 20 M LCL275 .

In summary location of the pyridine disc ring close to the polar part of ceramide structure caused these analogs to be less potent with LCL275 being the least potent compound from the CCPS family.

Fluorescent analog LCL186 also showed inhibitory effect on MCF7 cells growth IC50 4 M for 48 h treatment .

The inhibitory effect of these newly synthesized CCPS analogs was compared to the activity of D erythro C2 ceramide and D erythro C ceramide. These two synthetic ceramides are commonly used in cell experiments as cell permeable homologs of naturally occurring long chain ceramides which are not able to enter the cells. Study with those short chain ceramides at concentration 1.0 20.0 M showed that C2 ceramide was inactive and C ceramide had only low antiproliferative effect with ICvalue corresponding to 15.0 M at 48 h .

The antiproliferative effect of the CCPS analogs was examined in MCF7 breast cancer cell line and compared to the activity of D e C ceramide IC50 48 h 15 M . The markedly highest effect was found for CCPS Compounds IC50 value LCL 8.0 M LCI150 1.0 M LCL29 0.6 mM LCL88 and 1.8 M LCL30 . Analogs from class B were less potent IC50 13 M LCL 277 and 15 M LCL 275 . No remarkable differences for activity of C stereoisomers were found however 2S diastereoisomers were more potent as compared to the 2R counterparts. Interestingly pyridinium dihydro ceramides dhCCPS were also active but with a lower potency as compared to their unsaturated analogs IC50 LCL 12.5 M LCL319 5.02 M LCL143 2.8 M LCL249 and 2.5 M LCL345 . As established by LC MS analysis dhCCPSs were metabolized to the corresponding CCPSs. FIG. B 

The effects of CCPS analogs on EndCer is shown in . Treatment with 5 M of LCL29 30 and 88 caused generation of an early Cer and had an early regulatory effect on Cer composition . The CCPS Compounds caused a very early 15 min down regulatory effect on the level of endogenous ceramide ECer and sphingosine ESph and a up regulatory effect on sphingosine 1 phosphate Sph 1P . Following the time course Sph 1P was decreased below the control level and the total Cers level was increased. Increase in ECer and changes in its composition were observed starting from 0.5 h up regulation of C16 C14 and C18 Cers and extended down regulation of C24 0 and C24 1 Cers . Apoptotic effect of CCPS analogs can be correlated with the induction of endogenous early C14 C18 and C16 Cers . It is also possible that an apoptotic signal was started by an earlier appearance of S1P. . The regulator effect of LCL85 and LCL120 on endogenous ceramide at 24 hours is shown in . Regulatory effect of LCL85 on endogenous C Ceramide compositions at 24 hours is shown in .

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma HNSCC is notoriously resistant to chemotherapy. The sphingolipid ceramide and its analogs have been demonstrated to exert anti tumor activity in many cell types however the effectiveness of these analogs has been limited by potency and solubility. Telomerase an RNA dependent DNA polymerase which elongates telomeres at the end of chromosomes is active in about 80 90 of the tumor tissues of the HNSCCs whereas it is not active in normal head and neck tissues. Since abnormal activation of telomerase in tumors appears to be required for their immortality telomerase is a significant therapeutic target for the development of cancer specific novel treatment strategies of HNSCCs. In this example the roles of water soluble C Pyr Cer in the inhibition of cell cycle and telomerase activity as compared to the conventional ceramides and or chemotherapeutic agents alone or in combination in various HNSCC cell lines were examined. The in vivo anticancer properties of these compounds were tested in a SCID mouse model.

Ceramides and chemotherapeutic agents. Short chain ceramide analogs D erythro and L threo ceramides with C Cfatty acid chain lengths were synthsized as described above. Cetylpyridinium bromide CPB monohydrate was purchased from Aldrich.

Cell lines and culture conditions. Human head and neck cancer cell lines UM SCC 1 retromolar trigone floor of the mouth UM SCC 12 primary tumor of larynx and UM SCC 22A cells were obtained from clinical samples. Cells were grown in DMEM containing 10 FCS and 1 penicillin streptomycin at 37 C. in 5 CO. The Wi 38 human lung fibroblasts were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were grown in DMEM as described above. Adult human epidermal keratinocytes were purchased from Cascade Biologics and were maintained in EpiLife medium with growth supplements as described by the manufacturer.

MTT cell survival assay and isobologram studies. The concentrations of agents that inhibited cell growth by 50 IC were determined from cell survival plots obtained by MTT. Triplicate wells were used for each treatment. The final concentration of DMSO a solvent for conventional ceramides GMZ and DOX in the growth medium was less than 0.1 v v which has no effect on cell growth and survival. Pyridinium ceramides were dissolved in sterile water or growth medium. In short after cells 5 10 10 well were seeded in 96 well plates for 24 hr they were treated with increasing concentrations of ceramide analogs for an additional 48 or 96 hr. For combination treatments ceramides and chemotherapeutic agents gemcitabine GMZ or doxorubicin DOX were added to the growth medium simultaneously during treatment. Isobologram plots were then constructed using ICvalues of the two agents alone or in combination obtained from MTT assays. A straight line joining points on x and y axes represent the ICconcentrations of two agents and the points representing the ICconcentrations of the combination of the two agents are represented as scatter plots on the same graphs. In general the points that fall within the left of the straight line indicate synergism. The experiments were performed as triplicates in at least 3 independent experiments.

Analysis of cell cycle profiles. The effects of pyridinium ceramides on the cell cycle profiles of A549 cells at 24 hr were analyzed in the presence of DNase free RNase and propidium iodine PI by flow cytometry as described in Ogretmen et al. 2001 276 24901 24910 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Untreated cells were used as controls.

Determination of telomerase activity. Telomerase activity in cell extracts was measured by the PCR based telomere repeat amplification protocol TRAP using TRAPeze kit Intergen Gaithersburg Md. which includes a 36 bp internal control to allow quantification of activity. In short the intensity of telomere specific DNA bands measured using Quantity One BioRad software were normalized to the intensity of internal control bands for each sample on polyacrylamide gels for quantification.

Exogenous ceramides have been shown to mediate anti proliferative responses such as cell cycle arrest apoptosis or senescence in various cancer cells. However since the solubility and bio availability of these exogenous ceramides are known to be limited the water soluble CCPS analogs were developed.

First to examine the effects of pyridinium ceramides containing different fatty acid chain length in cell growth the cells were treated with C C and C D e and L th pyr cer for 48 hr respectively . The ICconcentrations of C C and C D e and L th Pyr Cer were comparable in UM SCC 22A cells at 48 hr of treatment and these values about 1 M were higher than those obtained after 96 hr treatment about 300 nM . These results also demonstrate that the longer fatty acid chains in these pyridinium conjugated ceramide analogues did not appear to play a major role in their growth suppressing effects in these cells. Since the ICconcentrations of D e and L th C Pyr Cer were almost identical at both 48 and 96 hr they have been used interchangeably throughout this study. The effects of C Pyr Cer on the inhibition of cell survival were also examined in other HNSCC cell lines UM SCC 1 and UM SCC12 and similar results with ICvalues between 250 300 nM at 96 hr were obtained.

Next the growth inhibitory effects of conventional exogenous ceramides D erythro D e C ceramide and L thereo L th C ceramide and their newly developed highly water soluble cationic analogues D e C Pyr Cer and L th C Pyr Cer in the UM SCC 22A cells were determined using MTT assays after 96 hr treatment. As seen in D e C Pyr Cer and L th C Pyr Cer showed ICvalues ranging from 250 300 nM whereas conventional C ceramides failed to achieve an ICat concentrations up to 1300 nM showing that the newly developed C Pyr Cer is 4 fold more effective in inhibiting cell growth. Interestingly it seems that C Pyr Cer contains the optimum chain length for growth inhibition as the C Pyr Cer did not exert a significant effect on cell growth . Thus to date these novel C Pyr ceramides represent the most potent analogs of ceramide in exerting growth suppressing activity.

To evaluate the effects of the Lt C Pyr Cer in non cancerous cells the inhibition of cell growth in non cancerous Wi 38 human lung fibroblasts and adult human epidermal keratinocytes HEK in response to increasing concentrations of C pyridinium ceramide was assessed. Since the contents of growth media to maintain HEK and UM SCC 22A cells in culture are largely different than each other the effects of C Pyr Cer on the growth of HEK and UM SCC 22A cells were examined in two independent experiments by growing both of these cell lines either in the DMEM containing 10 FBS or in EpiLife medium with growth supplements in which HEK cells are normally maintained. Interestingly C Pyr Cer was not active in EpiLife medium ICconcentrations were 2 M at 96 hr for both of the cell lines. However when these cell lines were grown in DMEM the ICvalue of C Pyr Cer was greater than 1000 nM for keratinocytes whereas its ICconcentration in UM SCC 22A cells was about 300 nM. Similar results were also obtained using Wi 38 fibroblasts grown in DMEM in which ICconcentration of C Pyr Cer was 1000 nM . These results therefore suggest that C Pyr Cer is 4 fold more effective in inhibiting cell growth in squamous cell carcinoma cells than non cancerous fibroblasts or keratinocytes in vitro indicating a lower potential for general toxicity. This was further confirmed in vivo in which the maximum tolerated dose MTD of C Pyr Cer with no detectable toxicity in SCID mice was found to be around 80 100 mg kg which is comparable to the MTD of GMZ 80 mg kg whereas the MTD of DOX was between 1 2 mg kg in mice.

The effects of pyridinium ceramides on cell cycle profiles and telomerase activity in UM SCC 22A cells were examined using flow cytometry and TRAP assays as described in Materials and Methods. The results showed that treatment of UM SCC 22A cells with D e C C and C Pyr Cer at 1 M for 48 hr resulted in a significant increase in the population of cells in G0 G1 when compared to untreated controls . Thus these analogs caused an arrest in cycle progression.

Importantly examination of apoptotic cell death using annexin V staining in response to C Pyr Cer did not show any detectable signal and no sub G0 G1 apoptotic peaks in flow cytometry analysis were observed in the presence or absence of C Pyr Cer in these cells . Thus these ceramide analogs appear to exert minimal apoptotic activity on their own with selective cell cycle arrest in these cells.

The selective effects on cell cycle raised the possibility that these compounds may regulate telomerase function. Indeed treatment of cells with 100 250 and 500 nM C Pyr Cer for 96 hr causes about 30 50 and 75 inhibition of telomerase activity respectively when compared to that of untreated controls lanes 2 4 versus 1 . Additional results also showed that C Pyr Cer had no significant effect on telomerase activity when applied directly to the extracts in vitro even at 10 20 and 100 M lanes 7 9 demonstrating that the inhibition of telomerase by C Pyr Cer is not due to a direct inhibition of the enzyme but involves transcriptional and or post transcriptional regulation of telomerase. Thus these data demonstrate that these ceramide analogs cause a significant inhibition of telomerase which correlates with cell cycle arrest at G0 G1 in UM SCC 22A cells.

The conventional chemotherapy for head and neck cancers is the combination of cisplatinum with 5 FU or taxol. Experiments were conducted to determine whether the combination of C Pyr Cer would be synergistic in inhibiting growth when combined with anti cancer drugs. First the ICvalues of various chemotherapeutic agents were determined in UM SCC 22A cells using MTT assays. As shown in doxorubicin DOX daunorubicin DNR methotrexate MTX and gemcitabine GMZ exhibited the lowest ICvalues between 100 250 nM whereas cisplatinum CSP paclitaxel PAX carboplatinum CRBP and 5 fluorouracil 5 FU showed ICvalues between 1 100 M in these cells.

Next experiments were performed to determine whether C Pyr Cer inhibited cell growth synergistically in combination with DOX in UM SCC 22A cells the most potent inhibitor of cell survival in these cells. Quantitative isobologram studies were performed as described in Materials and Methods. The results demonstrated that the combination of C Pyr Cer at 25 50 and 100 nM with DOX for 96 hr decreased growth synergistically detected as shift of the ICvalues of DOX in the isobologram to the left of the line plot joining the x and y axes that represent the ICof C Pyr Cer and DOX alone respectively. Interestingly the optimum concentration of C Pyr Cer was 50 nM for its synergistic interaction with DOX and using 100 nM C Pyr Cer did not enhance synergy with DOX in these cells .

Since GMZ has been reported to delay tumor development in a xenograft model of human squamous cell carcinoma contaminated surgical wounds and also it was found to be one of the more potent inhibitors of cell growth in UM SCC 22A cells in the present study the effects of treatment of cells with the combination of C Pyr Cer on cell survival and telomerase activity were assessed. As seen in combining 1 M C Pyr Cer with various concentrations of GMZ for 48 hr treatment enhanced the anti proliferative effects of GMZ when compared to treatments with GMZ alone. The combination of cetyl pyridinium itself without conjugation to ceramide used as a non specific control with GMZ did not have any role on the efficacy of GMZ in these cells demonstrating a specific role for ceramide in the synergistic growth inhibition response to GMZ in these cells. To determine whether C Pyr Cer and GMZ also synergistically inhibited telomerase activity UM SCC 22A cells were treated with C Pyr Cer 1 M GMZ 100 nM or the combination of C Pyr Cer and GMZ for 48 hr. Then telomerase activity was measured using TRAP assay as described in Materials and Methods. As seen in treatment of UM SCC 22A cells with C Pyr Cer lane 2 or GMZ lane 3 resulted in the 30 50 inhibition of telomerase activity respectively whereas treatment of cells with the combination of C Pyr Cer and GMZ lane 4 caused a significant additional inhibition of telomerase activity about 90 in these cells as compared to untreated controls lane 1 .

The compound was further tested in an animal model of SCID mouse and UM SCC 22A xenografts hypopharynx . Xenograft development and treatment was carried out by standard methods. Once the xenograft achieved a standard volume the animals were randomized to receive no treatment control LCL 194 alone 40 mg kg LCL 124 alone 40 mg kg LCL 124 40 mg kg plus GMZ 80 mg kg GMZ 80 mg kg DOX 2 mg kg or 5FU plus cisplatin 25 mg kg each . Tumors were measured every 4 days. See for a comparison of tumor sizes after 24 days of treatment. The data clearly indicate that the CCPS analog of the invention LCL 124 can act alone or in combination with GMZ to suppress growth of chemotherapy resistant classes of tumors.

Taken together these results suggest that these newly developed cationic pyridinium ceramides can synergistically inhibit cell survival when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of HNSCC.

The results presented here show that the newly developed novel water soluble CCPS analogs pyridinium ceramides can inhibit cell growth of HNSCCs with about 250 300 nM ICconcentrations in vitro. The data demonstrate that the action of C Pyr Cer mechanistically involves the inhibition of telomerase which correlates with growth arrest at G0 G1 in these cells. In addition the treatment of non cancerous Wi 38 or adult HEK cells which do not express detectable telomerase activity with C Pyr Cer did not cause a significant inhibition of cell survival indicating a lower potential for overall toxicity. More importantly it has been also demonstrated in this study that pyridinium ceramides can potentiate the anti proliferative effects of known chemotherapeutic drugs such as GMZ and DOX in UM SCC 22A cells.

The standard of treatment for advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck HNSCC is continuing to evolve with increased emphasis on the use of organ sparing chemoradiotherapy regimens. While survival data are comparable for early stage T1 2 oral cavity tumors with either radiation therapy or surgery most oral cavity cancers are treated surgically. Post operative radiation therapy may be beneficial for Stage III and IV oral cancer although chemotherapy has not been proven as a curative option for oral cancer at this time. Surgical resection requires complete tumor removal and frozen section margin analysis remains the standard of care. Novel molecular diagnostic techniques are currently being studied as markers for residual persistent and recurrent disease. Recent studies have shown that telomerase is activated in about 90 of the HNSCC tumors while it is not active in the majority of normal H N tissue indicating that the inhibition of telomerase might provide cancer specific therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HNSCC. The results here show that one of the mechanisms involved in the inhibition of cell survival by pyridinium ceramides is the inhibition of telomerase.

The conventional chemotherapy of the HNSCCs in the clinic involves mainly the combination of CSP with 5 FU or PAX. However these compounds had no significant effects on cell growth when applied either alone or in combination in UM SCC 22A cells. Interestingly GMZ and DOX seem to be very effective in inhibiting the growth of these cells in vitro with very low ICconcentrations. Recent studies have evaluated the combination of GMZ with the antineoplastic vinka alkaloid vinorelbine in HNSCCs which showed no reported pharmacokinetic or synergistic interaction. Combination therapy involving anthracyclines has been analyzed recently advocating the dosage limitations of these cardiotoxic compounds in HNSCCs. However since the results with GMZ in combination with pyridinium ceramides appear to be particularly promising their synergistic roles in the inhibition of cell growth in HNSCC and development as therapeutic agents are very promising.

The following example demonstrates that the positively charged or cationic pyridinium ceramide analogs readily accumulate in isolated and in situ mitochondria. Accumulated positively charged ceramides increased inner membrane permeability and triggered release of mitochondrial cytochrome C. Furthermore positively charged ceramide induced permeability increase was suppressed by cyclosporin A 60 CSA and 1 3 dicyclohexylcarbodiimide 90 DCCD . The results suggest that the inner membrane permeability increase is due to activation of specific ion transporters not the generalized loss of lipid bilayer barrier functions. The difference in sensitivity of ceramide induced ion fluxes to the inhibitors of mitochondrial transporters suggests activation of at least two transport systems the permeability transition pore and the electrogenic H channel.

The pellet was washed with 1 ml of ice cold PBS cells were resuspended in 3000 of isolation medium containing 230 mM mannitol 70 mM sucrose 2 mM EDTA and 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 adjusted by KOH and then the cells were disrupted by 20 passages through 28G needle. Homogenate was centrifuged at 900 g for 10 min to pellet the nucleus and unbroken cells.

To determine whether whole cells will accumulate exogenous pyridiniunceramides in the mitochondrial matrix we used a fluorescent analog of Cpyridiniun ceramide Cpyridinium DMAS ceramide. Both Cpyridinium DMAS ceramide and TMRM treated cells demonstrated a similar punctate pattern of staining characteristic of mitochondria. Thus Cpyridinium DMAS ceramide accumulates selectively in mitochondria in living cells. Subsequent addition of uncoupler FCCP in combination with inhibitors of the respiratory chain and ATPase antimycin A and oligomycin respectively resulted in diffuse staining of the cytoplasm for both fluorophores indicating that mitochondrial accumulation of Cpyridinium DMAS ceramide in intact cells is indeed energy dependent. In the presence of uncouplers the diffuse staining of Cpyridinium DMAS ceramide probably reflects equilibration of this molecule in cell membranes without specific concentration in any one compartment.

In contrast to Cpyridinium DMAS ceramide cells treated with a fluorescent analog of neutral Cceramide namely C NBD ceramide developed prominent fluorescence in a perinuclear region whereas mitochondrial staining was minimal. These results are consistent with several previous studies that have identified this compartment as the Golgi apparatus and indeed C NBD ceramide has been forwarded as a specific marker of this compartment. Also in agreement with previous observations that accumulation of C NBD ceramide in the Golgi apparatus is energy independent demonstrates that uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation do not affect staining of the perinuclear compartment by C 6 NBD ceramide. Taken together these experiments provide evidence that the exogenously added pyridinium ceramide localizes preferentially to mitochondria and its mitochondrial accumulation in situ is energy dependent.

To demonstrate definitively that Cpyridinium ceramide preferentially accumulates in mitochondria Hep G2 cells were treated with equal concentrations of Cceramide and Cpyridinium ceramide 3 M for 30 min mitochondria were then isolated and ceramide values were determined by MS. The amount of Cpyridinium ceramide in mitochondria was approximately 7 fold higher compared to the amount of Cceramide 985 and 142 pmol mg protein respectively . Cpyridinium ceramide is a potent effector of cell viability. Next C6 pyridinium ceramide was tested to see it is a more potent cell killing agent compared to its uncharged analog. Indeed Cpyridinium ceramide readily induced killing of hepatocarcinoma Hep G2 cells IC50 of about 8 M trace 2 while electroneutral Cceramide was much less effective in the same range of concentrations IC50 of about 31 M trace 1 . The effect of Cpyridinium ceramide is not unique for Hep G2 cells. MCF7 breast cancer cells also respond to this compound . MCF7 cells appear to be more sensitive to C ceramide than Hep G2 cells IC50 of about 16 M and demonstrate considerable increase in sensitivity to Cpyridinium ceramide IC50 of about 2 M .

Accumulation of Cpyridinium ceramide in isolated rat liver mitochondria isenergy dependent. Next it was determined if the accumulation of Cpyridinium ceramide by isolated mitochondria was energy dependent. Addition of Cpyridinium ceramide 10 M to mitochondria resulted in 95 association with mitochondria . Dissipation of mitochondrial by simultaneous addition of the complex III inhibitor antimycin and the protonophore FCCP suppressed accumulation of Cpyridinium ceramide by 66.8 . The difference in the amount of ceramide bound in the absence and in the presence of uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation provides the amount of ceramide accumulated by mitochondria in an energy dependent manner whereas the component resistant to uncouplers indicates the ceramide that maybe partitioned into the lipid phase of mitochondrial membranes or associated with non specific binding sites. Calculating the approximate mitochondrial matrix volume as 1.6 l mg protein and dependent uptake of pyridinium ceramide as 6.28 nmol mg protein the concentration of pyridinium ceramide in the matrix space can reach 3.9 mM. On the other hand addition of uncharged Cceramide 10 M also resulted in its considerable 79.3 association with mitochondria. The striking difference between association of positively charged Cpyridinium and electroneutral Cceramides is that association of the latter is insensitive to dissipation of . Thus association of Cceramide with mitochondria is exclusively related to its partitioning into the lipid phase of mitochondria and or its association with nonspecific mitochondrial binding sites. Therefore Cceramide is evenly redistributed between the lipid phase of the inner and outer membranes with equal concentration of free ceramide in the intermembrane space and the matrix. In contrast Cpyridinium ceramide is highly enriched in the inner membrane of energized mitochondria and its free concentration in the matrix space is considerably elevated compared to that of the intermembrane space.

Cpyridinium ceramide is a potent and specific inducer of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. The results shown above suggest that Cpyridinium ceramide because of its greater accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix should affect mitochondrial function more potently than neutral ceramides. To this end we compared the effects of Cpyridinium ceramide and its neutral derivative on permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane for low molecular weight solutes. Respiring liver mitochondria which contain about 10 15 nmol of endogenous Ca2 mg protein maintained accumulated TPP an index of for more then 30 min. trace 1 . Only slight decreases in the absorbance of the mitochondrial suspension indicative of swelling was observed under these conditions trace 1 consistent with previous results on isolated mitochondria. The addition of 40 M Cpyridinium ceramide induced a biphasic release of accumulated TPP trace 2 . The initial partial release of TPP was accomplished within 4 min and was followed by a slower phase of total TPP release that reflects complete dissipation of . This later phase was accompanied by rapid decrease in absorbance which indicates stimulation of large amplitude swelling caused by increased permeability of the inner membrane to the components of the incubation medium trace 2 . Indeed the effects of Cpyridinium ceramide are very similar to those of the pore forming peptide alamethicin ALA whose addition to the mitochondrial suspension produced essentially the same light scattering response as Cpyridinium ceramide trace 3 suggesting that this ceramide enhances pore formation.

Importantly examination of mitochondrial ultrastructure by electron microscopy before and 30 min after the addition of Cpyridinium ceramide revealed a typical picture of large amplitude mitochondrial swelling whereas in the absence of Cpyridinium ceramide mitochondria remained in the aggregated configuration characterized by a shrunken matrix space and large intracristal space. Incubation of mitochondria with Cpyridinium ceramide resulted in an extensive increase of matrix volume and unfolded cristae characteristic of colloido osmotic swelling. The inner membrane remained apparently intact whereas the outer membrane was mostly ruptured and detached from the inner membrane. Thus the above results show that Cpyridinium ceramide exerts significant effects on isolated mitochondria which is characterized by a relatively specific increase in permeability of the inner membrane. In contrast to Cpyridinium ceramide which induced dissipation of trace 2 as well as mitochondrial swelling with an IC50 of about 27.5 M trace 1 neutral C6 ceramide failed to induce dissipation of trace 3 or mitochondrial permeabilization at concentrations up to 60 M traces B3 and C .

To determine the effect of the pyridinium moiety on mitochondrial permeabilization we evaluated the effect of a short chain Cpyridinium ceramide. shows that employed at the same concentration as Cpyridinium ceramide 40 M Cpyridinium ceramide caused only minor changes in the magnitude of mitochondrial swelling and the value of compared to control traces A4 and B4 . Even employed at 60 M trace 2 binding 29.8 nmol mg protein at 4 min Cpyridinium ceramide failed to induce the same degree of swelling that was observed with 30 M of Cceramide B trace 2 binding 5 0.8 nmol mg protein at 4 min . These results indicate that the potency of ceramide to induce mitochondrial permeabilization increases with the introduction of a positive charge into the molecule and with the elongation of the alkyl moiety.

As for cetyl pyridinium when used at 60 M provides only moderate mitochondrial swelling trace 4 . In line with this notion two other hydrophobic cations namely TPP and TMRM that readily accumulate in mitochondrial matrix driven by negative inside fail to induce large amplitude swelling even at concentrations twice as much as Cpyridinium ceramide TPP TMRM B traces 3 and 5 concentration 60 M binding 50 2.6 nmol mg protein at 4 min Cpyridinium ceramide trace 2 concentration 30 M binding 5 0.8 nmol mg protein at 4 min . To the contrary inhibition of the basal swelling rate is observed.

To further confirm that the effect of C pyridinium ceramide is specific with respect to the structure of this molecule we investigated the permeabilizing properties of its structural analog viz. C pyridinium dihydroceramide which differs only by the lack of a 4 5 trans double bond in the sphingoid backbone. shows a three fold increase in the lag period of the induction of mitochondrial swelling in the presence of C pyridinium dihydroceramide trace 3 concentration of 30 M binding of 9.8 0.7 nmol mg of protein at 4 min compared with C pyridinium ceramide trace 2 concentration of 30 M binding of 5 0.8 nmol mg of protein at 4 min . Moreover the dose response curves demonstrate that increases in the different ceramide concentrations shortens the lag periods of C pyridinium and C pyridinium dihydroceramide induced swelling. These data indicate that the unsatured pyridinium ceramide analogue is somewhat more effective than the pyridinium dihydroceramide analogue.

Overall these results indicate that Cpyridinium ceramide can be considered as an analog of the uncharged ceramide and its action does not reflect non specific mitochondrial perturbation that could be expected with any cationic hydrophobic compound.

Inhibitors of mitochondrial ion transporters CSA and DCCD suppress Cpyridinium ceramide induced mitochondrial permeability increase. The permeability increase observed in the presence Cpyridinium ceramide could arise from the formation of lipid channels as a result of perturbation of the hydrophobic portion of the inner membrane or alternatively Cpyridinium ceramide could regulate specific transport pathways resulting in equilibration of small molecules and ions across the inner membrane large amplitude swelling and dissipation of . To discriminate between these two possibilities and address the mechanism by which Cpyridinium ceramide induces mitochondrial permeability we investigated the effects of the potent PTP inhibitor CSA and the non selective inhibitor of mitochondrial ion porters DCCD on Cpyridinium ceramide induced permeabilization of the inner membrane.

As shown in CSA substantially 60 suppressed and delayed the pyridinium ceramide induced decreases in and large amplitude swelling traces A3 and B3 respectively . Chelation of Ca2 the PTP activator by EDTA as well as the use of another PTP inhibitor bongkrekic acid resulted in a similar degree of suppression of ceramide induced mitochondrial alterations. The carboxylic group modifier dicyclohexilcarbodiimide DCCD although not as specific as CSA is also known as an inhibitor of PTP opening. DCCD also suppressed the permeability increase induced by Cpyridinium ceramide by 90 trace A2 . This inhibition reached a maximum at a DCCD concentration of about 40 nmol mg protein. In contrast to the slow phase of discharge the initial fast phase was insensitive to CSA traces A1 A3 and was accompanied by the shrinkage of mitochondria rather than by large amplitude swelling traces B1 B3 . This rapid discharge in could be explained by ceramide induced suppression of respiratory chain activity that could occur directly as described in or indirectly as a result of cytochrome C release from the intermembrane space. However addition of 10 M cytochrome C an amount exceeding that for maximum activation of respiratory chain activity to the incubation medium did not modify the mitochondrial response to Cpyridinium ceramide. Moreover measurement of oxygen consumption of the mitochondrial suspension showed nearly maximum acceleration of respiration within the first minutes after Cpyridinium ceramide addition panel B . These data strongly suggest activation of an electrogenic H leak across the inner membrane as a cause of decreased . Similar to PTP opening described above electrogenic ion fluxes arising in the first minutes after Cpyridinium ceramide addition are sensitive to DCCD as can be seen from suppression of acceleration of oxygen consumption trace A2 panel B . Therefore electrogenic H flux activated by ceramide is mediated by some specific porter not by disturbance of the lipid phase of the inner membrane.

The possible mitochondrial sites of ceramide action was investigated. The results shown earlier indicate that uncoupling of mitochondria correlates with the loss of Cpyridinium ceramide from the mitochondrial matrix. Under these same conditions addition of FCCP suppressed the swelling phase of the mitochondrial response to ceramide trace 4 . These observations therefore indicate that the sites of action of Cpyridinium ceramide to activate PTP is localized in the inner membrane or matrix space of the mitochondria. Cpyridinium ceramide induces cytochrome C release in an energy dependent manner. Studies aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of ceramide induced cell death showed that ceramide acts at least in part by inducing the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria. Formation by ceramides of specific pores for cytochrome C and molecules of up to 60 kDa in the outer mitochondrial membrane was suggested as a preferential mechanism for cytochrome C release. Yet induction by ceramides of the classical permeability transition of mitochondria which is accompanied by the their osmotic swelling rupture of the outer membrane and as a result by release of cytochrome C from the intermembrane space was proposed as an alternative model. To determine whether Cpyridinium ceramide is able to release cytochrome C from mitochondria and to address the mechanism by which this occurs experiments were conducted to evaluate its effect on cytochrome C release at conditions that result in mitochondrial swelling vs conditions when Cpyridinium ceramide large amplitude swelling was suppressed by FCCP trace 4 .

As shown in incubation of mitochondria with Cpyridinium ceramide results in progressive large amplitude swelling. After 20 minutes of incubation with Cpyridinium ceramide about 40 of cytochrome C is released from mitochondria . When Cpyridinium ceramide induced mitochondrial swelling was suppressed by the addition of FCCP plus antimycin A approximately a 3 fold decrease in cytochrome C release was observed which was comparable to the control value. Cceramide exerted no effect on cytochrome C release both in the absence and in the presence of uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation as compared to the control . Under the same conditions Cceramide failed to increase large amplitude swelling . Addition of pore forming peptide alamethicin provided 100 response in the parameters of interest that can be observed under conditions employed. These results indicate that the preferential mechanism of cytochrome C release by Cpyridinium ceramide is permeabilization of the inner membrane as an initial step with subsequent swelling and rupture of the outer membrane.

In this example the data show that positively charged Cpyridinium ceramide readily permeates the lipid bilayer and specifically targets the inner mitochondrial membrane and matrix space. Because of the large mitochondrial inner membrane potential negative inside these molecules accumulate inside isolated mitochondria and within mitochondria in cultured cells. Moreover accumulation of these molecules is reversible and can be prevented by discharge of . In addition the accumulation of these ceramides in the mitochondrial matrix space increases permeability of mitochondrial membranes by activating putative ion porters of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability transistion pore PTP and the electrogenic H channel.

The conclusion is supported by a number of observations. First Cpyridinium ceramide induced a light scattering response indicative of change in mitochondrial ultrastructure that was similar in magnitude to that observed under conventional Ca2 treatment or in the presence of the pore forming peptide alamethicin trace 3 . This suggests that the light scattering response observed in the presence of Cpyridinium ceramide reflects mitochondrial large amplitude swelling which is colloido osmotic in nature as opposed to non specific amphiphilic compound mediated solubilization of mitochondrial membranes. Additional support for the relative specificity of the permeability defect created by Cpyridinium ceramide in the inner membrane comes from examination of mitochondrial ultrastructure by electron microscopy. Comparison of mitochondrial ultrastructure before and after ceramide treatment revealed all the features of classical permeability transition increased mitochondrial volume unfolded cristae ruptured outer membranes and apparent intactness of the inner membrane. A second observation in support of PTP opening came from the use of the PTP inhibitors CSA and DCCD . Both these inhibitors suppressed or delayed mitochondrial large amplitude swelling and discharge of by 60 and 90 respectively. This indicates that the permeability transition observed in the presence of Cpyridinium ceramide is likely attributed to the activation of protein porters of the inner mitochondrial membrane rather than the formation of lipid channels created by segregation of ceramides in a special domain as was proposed earlier for the outer membrane.

The data provided herein also indicate that Cpyridinium ceramide activates additional ion transport pathways distinct from PTP. Indeed the shrinkage phase observed during the first minutes after ceramide addition and accompanying discharge of indicates selective loss of cations from the mitochondrial matrix and an activation of electrogenic ion fluxes without a simultaneous increase in permeability to sucrose which is usually observed in classical models of permeability transition. These relatively specific cation fluxes reflect operation of PTP in a low conductance impermeable to sucrose state.

The best explanation for the initial mitochondrial response to ceramide treatment is the simultaneous activation of selective electrogenic K and H fluxes. K is known to be the most abundant ion in the mitochondrial matrix playing a major role in regulation of mitochondrial volume. In this model increased H permeability across the inner membrane dissipates which allows K to be lost from the matrix according to its electrochemical potential that in turn results in mitochondrial shrinkage. The observation disclosed herein that suppression of Cpyridinium ceramide induced mitochondrial swelling by FCCP also resulted in suppression of cytochrome C release indicates that mitochondrial swelling is a prerequisite for the outer membrane permeability alterations. As for neutral Cceramide even at 40 nmol mg of protein a concentration twice that used by Siskind et al. 2002 277 26796 26803 this ceramide failed to induce considerable cytochrome C release as compared to the control. It has been reported that the loss by mitochondria of cytochrome C under the effect of C2 ceramide is highly dependent on the redox state of this protein with the oxidized state favoring the release. However there is no substantial release as compared to the control of cytochrome C by Cand Cpyridinium ceramides under conditions in which the respiratory chain downstream of complex III is completely oxidized by the presence of oxidative phosphorylation uncouplers. On the contrary suppression of cytochrome C release was observed. This provides evidence that in these examples the limiting step in cytochrome C release is not a redox state value but the formation of a permeability pathway for cytochrome C across the outer membrane.

Notably previous studies suggested that either Ca2 in the range of 100 150 M or Bax were required in addition to ceramide to cause permeability change in the outer and inner membranes. In contrast in our experiments Cpyridinium ceramide by itself induced permeabilization of the mitochondria or the requirement for Ca2 was extremely low estimated endogenous Ca2 is about 10 nmol mg protein . This effectiveness of Cpyridinium ceramide is explained by its greater accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix. In addition the low potency of Cpyridinium compared to Cpyridinium ceramide likely excludes the possibility of a nonspecific effect of the pyridinium group on mitochondrial membranes and underscores the importance of the length of N fatty acyl sphingosine moiety in mitochondrial permeabilization. The results obtained by in vitro experiments indicate that mitochondria are the primary targets for Cpyridinium ceramide in cell death and that the mechanism of cell death involves disruption of mitochondrial function. Indeed with confocal microscopy it was observed that preferential accumulation of Cpyridinium ceramide in the mitochondrial compartment and the relative potency of Cpyridinium ceramide to induce permeabilization of isolated mitochondria corresponds well with its ability to kill cells. One of the factors that should be kept in mind while considering the effect of ceramide treatment on cell viability is the concentration of ceramide in the vicinity of its target. Electroneutral ceramides redistribute preferentially in the Golgi apparatus which decreases their effective concentration in mitochondria. In contrast positively charged ceramides are specifically concentrated within their immediate target the inner mitochondrial membrane whereas redistribution to other compartments is relatively small. This specific redistribution of positively charged ceramide correlates well with its higher potency in cell killing compared to its neutral counterpart. In such a way the data support the utility of the invention which is based on a mechanism by which ceramides induce cell killing i.e. permeabilization of the inner mitochondrial membrane with subsequent release of cytochrome C. With respect to the mechanism of pyridinium ceramide induced cell death it should be noticed that permeability alterations of the inner membrane and subsequent release of cytochrome C observed in isolated mitochondria under effect of pyridinium ceramide are compatible with both apoptotic and necrotic pathways. Also MTT assay of cell viability based on measurement of mitochondrial dehydrogenase activities reflects both necrotic or late apoptotic cell death.

Irrespective of the mechanism of cell death the data suggest that positively charged ceramides could be effective for selective killing of cancer cells. The basis for this selectivity is a substantial difference in between normal and tumor cells. The difference in between carcinoma and control epithelial cells can be greater than 60 mV higher in carcinoma cells a difference that may allow for 10 times greater accumulation of positively charged ceramides in tumor mitochondria. Thus future studies are aimed at better understanding the nature of molecular targets for ceramide in mitochondria and on optimization of the molecular structure of positively charged ceramides to increase their accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix. Overall the results indicate the presence of specific ceramide targets in the mitochondrial matrix occupation of which alters permeability of the inner and outer membranes these findings confirm the therapeutic utility of positively charged CCPS analogs of the invention.

The intensity of telomere specific DNA bands measured using Quantity One BioRad software were normalized to the intensity of internal control bands for each sample on polyacrylamide gels for quantification. The mRNA levels of the catalytic subunit of telomerase hTERT human telomerase reverse transcriptase was measured after extraction of total RNA from tumor tissues extracted from the control or treated animals and normalized to mRNA levels of beta actin by Applied Biosystems 7300 real time quantitative PCR Q PCR system using TaqMan primer and probe sets for hTERT and beta actin Applied Biosystems . The protein levels of hTERT in these tumor tissue extracts in CHAPS buffer were determined by Western blot analysis using anti hTERT rabbit polyclonal antibody CalBiochem at 1 1000 dilution. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed using extracts from telomerase positive and negative extracts in Western blots.

Analysis of telomere length in tumor tissues. The measurement of telomere length was performed in total genomic DNA samples isolated from tumor tissues of the SCID mice using Telomere Restriction Fragment TRF Length measurement kit Roche by Southern blotting as described in Sundararaj et al. J Biol Chem 2004 279 6152 6162.

Statistical analysis. The statistical analysis of studies to determine the efficacy of L t C Pyr Cer in combination with GMZ in the inhibition of the growth of HNSCC tumors in vivo was performed using Tukey s Student Range Test and SAS MIXED procedures. Tukey s Student Range Test controls the over all Type I error rate probability of detecting difference in at least one pair of means below a pre specified level 5 for all multiple pair wise comparisons between treatment groups.

In SAS the MIXED procedure for mixed model approach is the flagship procedure for fitting linear models with fixed effects effects of observed explanatory variables to mean response as well as random effects unobservable effects due to random unobservable factors and unobservable within subject effects . SAS MIXED fits a variety of such models to data and enables to use these fitted models to make statistical inferences about the data. The default fitting method maximizes the restricted likelihood of the data under the assumption that the data are normally distributed and any missing data are missing at random. This general framework accommodates many common correlated data methods including repeated measures analyses.

Exogenous short chain ceramides are known to mediate cell cycle arrest apoptosis or senescence in various cancer cells. However because of their limited solubility and bio availability the water soluble pyridinium conjugated analogues of ceramides were developed. The chemical structure of the novel cationic ceramide L t C Pyr Cer is shown in . Pyridinium ceramide Pyr Cer analogues were designed to preferentially localize into negatively charged intracellular compartments especially mitochondria and nucleus. Therefore the sub cellular accumulation of L t C Pyr Cer in UM SCC 22A cells was examined using LC MS after treatment of cells with 1 M L t C Pyr Cer for various time points 1 3 6 12 24 and 48 hr . The results showed that the compound mainly accumulated in the 10 000 g fraction which is enriched mainly in mitochondria as early as 1 hr after treatment and then it continued to increase to higher levels 1 000 3 000 pmol 0.1 mg protein in this fraction between 3 48 hr treatment . Similarly L t C Pyr Cer was detectable in the 1 000 g fraction which is enriched in nuclei within 3 hr and reached to 250 2 500 pmol 0.1 mg protein levels in this fraction between 6 48 hr . The amounts of the compound in the supernatant or the pellet of 100 000 g fractions were either not detectable at 1 6 hr or minimal at 12 48 hr in these cells . The enrichment of mitochondria and nucleus in 10 000 g and 1 000 g fractions respectively were confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies that detect the mitochondrial protein porin 31HL and nuclear lamin B in these fractions. The absence of GAPDH in 10 000 g mitochondria enriched fractions also showed the lack of cytoplasmic contamination. Taken together these data demonstrate that L t C Pyr Cer mainly accumulates in the mitochondria and to a lesser extent in the nucleus within a short time after exposure as expected by its chemical composition and design in UM SCC 22A cells.

The effects of L t C Pyr Cer alone or in combination with GMZ on the growth of HNSCC cells in vitro. To determine the effects of L t C Pyr Cer on growth various HNSCC cell lines which represent various forms of HNSCC were treated with increasing concentrations of L t C Pyr Cer for 48 hr and its inhibitory concentration 50 IC50 a concentration that inhibits the growth by 50 was determined by MTT assays L t C Pyr Cer inhibited the growth of human HNSCC cell lines UM SCC 22A UM SCC 1 and UM SCC14A cells with similar IC50 concentrations of about 1 2 M at 48 hr . Since UM SCC 1 cells express wild type p53 whereas UM SCC 14A cells express mutated p53 their similar IC50 values for L t C Pyr Cer show that it regulates cell growth independent of p53 status.

Growth inhibitory effects of L t C Pyr Cer in combination with various conventional chemotherapeutic agents were tested. The synergistic interaction between L t C Pyr Cer and GMZ in the inhibition of growth of UM SCC 22A cells was evaluated using quantitative isobologram studies. The data showed that the combination of L t C Pyr Cer at its sub IC50 values 100 250 and 500 nM with increasing concentrations of GMZ for 48 hr decreased growth synergistically as detected by the shift of the ICvalues of GMZ in the isobologram to the left of the line plot joining the x and y axes that represent the ICof L t C Pyr Cer and GMZ respectively . In addition analysis of cell cycle profiles showed that treatment with L t C Pyr Cer in combination with GMZ at 500 and 50 nM respectively for 48 hr resulted in a cell cycle arrest at G0 G1 and decreased S phase and G2 M cell population as compared to controls . Interestingly there was no apparent apoptosis in response to this combination treatment in these cells .

The inhibition of HNSCC tumor growth by L t C Pyr Cer alone or in combination with GMZ in vivo. First in order to evaluate the effects of L t C Pyr Cer in the inhibition of growth in vivo its maximum tolerated dose MTD was determined by treatment of BALB c mice with increasing concentrations of L t C Pyr Cer at 10 150 mg kg for various time points. The data demonstrated that treatment of mice with a single dose of L t C Pyr Cer at 120 150 mg ml resulted in toxicity with extreme abdominal bloating and intestinal malfunction in some animals after about 6 hr of IP injection whereas treatment of animals with 10 80 mg kg of the compound for 1 4 days did not have any detectable toxicity to the animals as determined by both gross examination of the animals and histo pathological examination of the tissue sections of brain heart lungs liver kidney intestines and bone marrow. Thus the MTD of L t C Pyr Cer was determined as 80 mg kg in mice which did not cause any detectable toxicity in these animals after either single or multiple cycles every 4 days for 20 days of treatment.

Next the pharmacokinetic parameters of L t C Pyr Cer such as clearance from the blood and bioaccumulation in various organs were examined by LC MS after IP injections of the compound at 40 mg ml half of the MTD that would be used for the in vivo therapeutic studies for various time points. As shown in the serum levels of the compound reached 4 500 to 6 500 pmol 0.1 ml serum between 0.5 2 hr of injection respectively and cleared from the serum within 4 hr. The levels of the compound increased slightly first in the intestines after 5 min and in the liver after 2 hr at about 600 and 500 pmol mg protein respectively . The compound started to accumulate mainly in the kidney between 4 8 hr . There was some accumulation in the lungs after 24 hr and no significant accumulation in the brain or heart . These data suggest that L t C Pyr Cer goes through systemic delivery within 2 4 hr and accumulates in the intestines liver and lungs at moderate levels and at high levels in the kidneys within 8 24 hr possibly for excretion. These data showed the main accumulation of other lipophilic pyridinium cations in the kidneys and excretion in the urine.

To determine the therapeutic efficacy of L t C Pyr Cer alone or in combination with GMZ HNSCC xenografts in SCID mice were developed by subcutaneous injection of UM SCC 22A cells to the both sides of the flank. After the tumors were established the animals were treated with L t C Pyr Cer or GMZ alone or in combination at 40 mg kg each at or below their half of MTDs every 4 days for 20 days. As shows treatment with L t C Pyr Cer or GMZ as single agent caused some inhibition of HNSCC tumor growth in vivo as compared to untreated controls which were not statistically significant p values were 0.67 and 0.17 respectively . However the combination of L t C Pyr Cer with GMZ almost completely inhibited the tumor growth in a statistically significant manner p

To confirm the lack of toxicity in response to L t C Pyr Cer GMZ treatment tumors and the vital organs were surgically removed after the completion of the study and H E staining of the tissue sections was performed. The histopathologic analysis of the tumors confirmed that they were SCC bottom panel and further analysis of the vital organs of the animals treated with L t C Pyr Cer alone or in combination with GMZ showed no detectable toxicity. The blood counts the levels of enzyme activities and electrolytes in the serum of the animals after these treatments about 20 parameters including red blood cell and hemoglobin blood urea nitrogen creatinine Na Mg alanine amino transferase and amylase were also analyzed . There were no detectable abnormalities in these levels in response to L t C Pyr Cer alone or in combination with GMZ confirming the lack of overall toxicity.

More importantly analysis of the levels of L t C Pyr Cer in HNSCC tumors removed after the completion of the study by LC MS showed that its accumulation in the tumor site was about 2 200 pmol mg when used as a single agent whereas its levels in the tumors increased about 40 up to 3 100 pmol mg when combined with GMZ . The levels of the compound in the intestines and the liver in the absence of GMZ were about 120 and 100 pmol mg protein which increased to 1 000 and 300 pmol mg protein in the presence of GMZ. Thus these data demonstrate that the levels of the compound in tumors were about 3 6 fold higher than its levels in intestines or liver of the animals in the absence or presence of GMZ . Interestingly analysis of the effects of L t C Pyr Cer alone or in combination of GMZ on the endogenous levels of ceramide in tumor site and B or in the vital organs of the animals showed that treatments with L t C Pyr Cer alone or in combination with GMZ did not cause any sustained elevation of endogenous ceramides when compared to untreated controls and B suggesting that it does not affect the long term metabolism of endogenous ceramide directly or indirectly. Similar data were also observed for the endogenous SM levels in which no significant changes were observed in response to these treatments when compared to untreated controls and D .

Role of L t C Pyr Cer in combination with GMZ in the regulation of telomerase in vivo. To examine whether the inhibition of HNSCC tumor growth in response to L t C Pyr Cer alone or in combination with GMZ mechanistically involves the inhibition of telomerase in vivo the levels of enzyme activity hTERT mRNA and protein levels were measured in tumor extracts by TRAP Q PCR and Western blotting respectively. As shows telomerase activity was inhibited significantly in HNSCC tumors of the animals treated with the combination of L t C Pyr Cer and GMZ by about 60 which was concomitant with a significant reduction of TRF length about 700 bp in these tumors as compared to untreated controls lanes 4 and 1 respectively . Treatment with L t C Pyr Cer and GMZ as single agents also caused attrition in telomere length about 500 and 200 bp respectively as compared to controls lanes 3 2 and 1 respectively .

Consistent with the mechanisms of action of ceramide in the regulation of telomerase activity at the mRNA levels of hTERT in various human cancer cell lines in vitro the inhibition of telomerase by L t C Pyr Cer correlated with the decreased levels of hTERT mRNA and protein expression when compared to controls in vivo and D lanes 3 and 1 respectively . However although treatment with the combination of L t C Pyr Cer and GMZ did not cause any detectable changes in the mRNA levels of hTERT the protein levels of hTERT were significantly inhibited lane 4 in response to this combination indicating a post transcriptional regulation which is distinct from the effects of L t C Pyr Cer alone. The protein levels of beta actin in these samples were used as loading controls lower panel .

Taken together these data demonstrate for the first time that treatment with the combination of L t C Pyr Cer with GMZ results in a significant inhibition of telomerase activity and decreased telomere length in HNSCC tumors in vivo. In vivo modulation of telomerase activity by this combination at the post transcriptional level results in a significant decrease on the levels of hTERT protein.

In the present invention the growth inhibitory roles of the cationic ceramide L t C Pyr Cer alone or in combination with GMZ against HNSCC cells both in vitro and in vivo were examined. It was demonstrated that L t C Pyr Cer accumulates mainly in the mitochondria and to a lesser extend in the nuclei enriched sub cellular fractions which is consistent with its design and targeting. The data also showed that L t C Pyr Cer significantly inhibits the growth of various HNSCC cell lines with similar 1050 concentrations independent of their p53 status. The synergistic effects of L t C Pyr Cer in combination with GMZ were also determined by quantitative isobologram studies in vitro. More importantly after preclinical parameters were determined the data revealed for the first time that treatment with L t C Pyr Cer GMZ almost completely inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft models of HNSCC in SCID mice which was much more effective than the effects of 5 FU CP combination. The LC MS analysis showed that the levels of L t C Pyr Cer in the tumor site are significantly higher than its levels in the liver and intestines and interestingly the combination with GMZ increased the sustained accumulation of this ceramide by about 40 . Mechanistically the inhibition of HNSCC tumor growth and or progression by L t C Pyr Cer GMZ was linked to the inhibition of telomerase and decrease in telomere length. The modulation of telomerase appeared to be regulated at the post transcriptional level of hTERT protein leading to a significant decrease in the levels of hTERT in response to this combination in vivo.

Because of inherent limitations in their solubility and bioavailability of conventional exogenous ceramides novel Pyr Cers with greater water solubility cell membrane permeability and cellular uptake have been designed and synthesized as described in the present invention. The presence of the positive charge by the pyridinium ring in their structures was designed to target and accumulate these ceramide analogues into negatively charged intracellular compartments especially mitochondria and nucleus. These properties of Pyr Cer is important for targeting these molecules preferentially into tumor sites. The accumulation of L t C Pyr Cer preferentially in mitochondria and to a lesser extend in nuclei enriched fractions was established in UM SCC 22A cells in vitro and this was also consistent with the higher accumulation of the compound in the tumor site than in the liver and intestines in vivo. Novgorodov et al. 2005 J. Biol. Chem. 280 16 16096 16105.

The lack of overall toxicity in animals in response to the combination of L t C Pyr Cer and GMZ is significant indicating that this combination provides alternative approaches for the treatment of HNSCC with limited toxicity.

Importantly the results presented here also indicated for the first time that one of the mechanisms by which L t C Pyr Cer GMZ combination inhibits the growth and or progression of HNSCC tumors is via the modulation of telomerase activity and decreased telomere length in vivo.

In summary the results presented here indicate that treatment with CCPS analogs such as water soluble L t C Pyr Cer in combination with nucleoside analogs such as GMZ inhibits HNSCC tumor growth and or progression via a mechanism which involves the inhibition of telomerase and decrease in telomere length with no detectable overall toxicity in vivo. Thus combination of L t C Pyr Cer and GMZ and combinations of other CCPS analogs with chemotherapeutic agents can provide alternative strategies for the improved management control of HNSCC in vivo.
