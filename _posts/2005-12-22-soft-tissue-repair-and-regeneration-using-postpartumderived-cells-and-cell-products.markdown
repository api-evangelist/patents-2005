This invention relates to the field of mammalian cell biology and cell culture. In particular the invention relates to cultured cells derived from postpartum tissue having the potential to support cells of and or differentiate to cells of a soft tissue lineage and methods of preparation and use of those postpartum tissue derived cells. The invention also relates to methods for the use of such postpartum derived cells in the regeneration and repair of soft tissue and in cell based therapies for conditions of soft tissue.

Injuries to soft tissue for example vascular skin or musculoskeletal tissue are quite common. One example of a fairly common soft tissue injury is damage to the pelvic floor. This is a potentially serious medical condition that may occur during childbirth or from complications thereof which can lead to damage to the vesicovaginal fascia. Such an injury can result in a cystocele which is a herniation of the bladder. Similar medical conditions include rectoceles a herniation of the rectum enteroceles a protrusion of the intestine through the rectovaginal or vesicovaginal pouch and enterocystoceles a double hernia in which both the bladder and intestine protrude .

The basic manifestation of a hernia is a protrusion of an organ into a defect within the fascia. Surgical approaches toward hernia repair have focused on reducing the presence of the hernial contents in the peritoneal cavity and generating a firm closure of the fascial defect either by using prosthetic allogeneic or autologous materials. A number of techniques have been used to produce this closure including the movement of autologous tissues and the use of synthetic mesh products. Drawbacks to these current products and procedures include hernia recurrence upon weakening of the closure.

As another example of a soft tissue condition ligaments and tendons are viscoelastic structures that mediate normal joint movement and stability and are subject to tear and brittleness with age or injury. These structures are complex relatively static collagenous structures with functional links to the bone muscle menisci and other nearby tendons and ligaments.

Soft tissue conditions further include for example conditions of skin e.g. ischemic wounds diabetic wounds scar revision or the treatment of traumatic wounds severe burns skin ulcers e.g. decubitus pressure ulcers venous ulcers and diabetic ulcers and surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers vascular conditions e.g. vascular disease such as peripheral arterial disease abdominal aortic aneurysm carotid disease and venous disease vascular injury and improper vascular development conditions affecting vocal cords cosmetic conditions e.g. those involving repair augmentation or beautification muscle diseases e.g. congenital myopathies myasthenia gravis inflammatory neurogenic and myogenic muscle diseases and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy Becker muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy limb girdle muscular dystrophy facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy congenital muscular dystrophies oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy distal muscular dystrophy and Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy conditions of connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments including but not limited to a periodontal ligament and anterior cruciate ligament and conditions of organs and or fascia e.g. the bladder intestine pelvic floor .

Surgical approaches to correct soft tissue conditions or defects in the body generally involve the implantation of structures made of biocompatible inert materials that attempt to replace or substitute for the defective function. Implantation of non biodegradable materials results in permanent structures that remain in the body as a foreign object. Implants that are made of resorbable materials are suggested for use as temporary replacements where the object is to allow the healing process to replace the resorbed material. However these approaches have met with limited success for the long term correction of structures in the body.

Thus novel therapeutic regimens for conditions related to soft tissue are of great clinical significance.

The invention is generally directed to postpartum derived cells which are derived from postpartum tissue which is substantially free of blood and which is capable of self renewal and expansion in culture and having the potential to differentiate into or provide trophic support to a cell of a mesodermal or ectodermal lineage for example a soft tissue cell phenotype.

Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the detailed description and examples that follow.

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells defined by their ability at the single cell level to both self renew and differentiate to produce progeny cells including self renewing progenitors non renewing progenitors and terminally differentiated cells. Stem cells are also characterized by their ability to differentiate in vitro into functional cells of various cell lineages from multiple germ layers endoderm mesoderm and ectoderm as well as to give rise to tissues of multiple germ layers following transplantation and to contribute substantially to most if not all tissues following injection into blastocysts.

Stem cells are classified by their developmental potential as 1 totipotent able to give rise to all embryonic and extraembryonic cell types 2 pluripotent able to give rise to all embryonic cell types 3 multipotent able to give rise to a subset of cell lineages but all within a particular tissue organ or physiological system for example hematopoietic stem cells HSC can produce progeny that include HSC self renewal blood cell restricted oligopotent progenitors and all cell types and elements e.g. platelets that are normal components of the blood 4 oligopotent able to give rise to a more restricted subset of cell lineages than multipotent stem cells and 5 unipotent able to give rise to a single cell lineage e.g. spermatogenic stem cells .

Stem cells are also categorized on the basis of the source from which they may be obtained. An adult stem cell is generally a multipotent undifferentiated cell found in tissue comprising multiple differentiated cell types. The adult stem cell can renew itself and under normal circumstances differentiate to yield the specialized cell types of the tissue from which it originated and possibly other tissue types. An embryonic stem cell is a pluripotent cell from the inner cell mass of a blastocyst stage embryo. A fetal stem cell is one that originates from fetal tissues or membranes. A postpartum stem cell is a multipotent or pluripotent cell that originates substantially from extraembryonic tissue available after birth namely the placenta and the umbilicus. These cells have been found to possess features characteristic of pluripotent stem cells including rapid proliferation and the potential for differentiation into many cell lineages. Postpartum stem cells may be blood derived e.g. as are those obtained from umbilical cord blood or non blood derived e.g. as obtained from the non blood tissues of the umbilical cord and placenta .

Embryonic tissue is typically defined as tissue originating from the embryo which in humans refers to the period from fertilization to about six weeks of development. Fetal tissue refers to tissue originating from the fetus which in humans refers to the period from about six weeks of development to parturition. Extraembryonic tissue is tissue associated with but not originating from the embryo or fetus. Extraembryonic tissues include extraembryonic membranes chorion amnion yolk sac and allantois umbilical cord and placenta which itself forms from the chorion and the maternal decidua basalis .

Differentiation is the process by which an unspecialized uncommitted or less specialized cell acquires the features of a specialized cell such as a nerve cell or a muscle cell for example. A differentiated or differentiation induced cell is one that has taken on a more specialized committed position within the lineage of a cell. The term committed when applied to the process of differentiation refers to a cell that has proceeded in the differentiation pathway to a point where under normal circumstances it will continue to differentiate into a specific cell type or subset of cell types and cannot under normal circumstances differentiate into a different cell type or revert to a less differentiated cell type. De differentiation refers to the process by which a cell reverts to a less specialized or committed position within the lineage of a cell. As used herein the lineage of a cell defines the heredity of the cell i.e. which cells it came from and what cells it can give rise to. The lineage of a cell places the cell within a hereditary scheme of development and differentiation. A lineage specific marker refers to a characteristic specifically associated with the phenotype of cells of a lineage of interest and can be used to assess the differentiation of an uncommitted cell to the lineage of interest.

In a broad sense a progenitor cell is a cell that has the capacity to create progeny that are more differentiated than itself and yet retains the capacity to replenish the pool of progenitors. By that definition stem cells themselves are also progenitor cells as are the more immediate precursors to terminally differentiated cells. When referring to the cells of the present invention as described in greater detail below this broad definition of progenitor cell may be used. In a narrower sense a progenitor cell is often defined as a cell that is intermediate in the differentiation pathway i.e. it arises from a stem cell and is intermediate in the production of a mature cell type or subset of cell types. This type of progenitor cell is generally not able to self renew. Accordingly if this type of cell is referred to herein it will be referred to as a non renewing progenitor cell or as an intermediate progenitor or precursor cell.

As used herein the phrase differentiates into a mesodermal ectodermal or endodermal lineage refers to a cell that becomes committed to a specific mesodermal ectodermal or endodermal lineage respectively. Examples of cells that differentiate into a mesodermal lineage or give rise to specific mesodermal cells include but are not limited to cells that are adipogenic chondrogenic cardiogenic dermatogenic hematopoietic endothelial myogenic nephrogenic urogenitogenic osteogenic pericardiogenic or stromal. Examples of cells that differentiate into ectodermal lineage include but are not limited to epithelial cells neurogenic cells and neurogliagenic cells. Examples of cells that differentiate into endodermal lineage include but are not limited to pleurigenic cells and hepatogenic cells cells that give rise to the lining of the intestine and cells that give rise to pancreogenic and splanchogenic cells.

The cells of the invention are referred to herein as postpartum derived cells or postpartum cells PPDCs . Subsets of the cells of the present invention are referred to as placenta derived cells PDCs or umbilicus derived cells UDCs . In addition the cells may be described as being stem or progenitor cells the latter term being used in the broad sense. The term derived is used to indicate that the cells have been obtained from their biological source and grown or otherwise manipulated in vitro e.g. cultured in a growth medium to expand the population and or to produce a cell line . The in vitro manipulations of postpartum derived cells and the unique features of the postpartum derived cells of the present invention are described in detail below.

Various terms are used to describe cells in culture. Cell culture refers generally to cells taken from a living organism and grown under controlled conditions in culture . A primary cell culture is a culture of cells tissues or organs taken directly from organisms and before the first subculture. Cells are expanded in culture when they are placed in a growth medium under conditions that facilitate cell growth and or division resulting in a larger population of the cells. When cells are expanded in culture the rate of cell proliferation is sometimes measured by the amount of time needed for the cells to double in number. This is referred to as doubling time.

A cell line is a population of cells formed by one or more subcultivations of a primary cell culture. Each round of subculturing is referred to as a passage. When cells are subcultured they are referred to as having been passaged. A specific population of cells or a cell line is sometimes referred to or characterized by the number of times it has been passaged. For example a cultured cell population that has been passaged ten times may be referred to as a P10 culture. The primary culture i.e. the first culture following the isolation of cells from tissue is designated P0. Following the first subculture the cells are described as a secondary culture P1 or passage 1 . After the second subculture the cells become a tertiary culture P2 or passage 2 and so on. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that there may be many population doublings during the period of passaging therefore the number of population doublings of a culture is greater than the passage number. The expansion of cells i.e. the number of population doublings during the period between passaging depends on many factors including but not limited to the seeding density substrate medium and time between passaging.

A conditioned medium is a medium in which a specific cell or population of cells has been cultured and then removed. While the cells are cultured in the medium they secrete cellular factors that can provide trophic support to other cells. Such trophic factors include but are not limited to hormones cytokines extracellular matrix ECM proteins vesicles antibodies and granules. The medium containing the cellular factors is the conditioned medium.

Generally a trophic factor is defined as a substance that promotes survival growth proliferation maturation differentiation and or maintenance of a cell or stimulates increased activity of a cell. Trophic support is used herein to refer to the ability to promote survival growth proliferation maturation differentiation and or maintenance of a cell or to stimulate increased activity of a cell.

When referring to cultured vertebrate cells the term senescence also replicative senescence or cellular senescence refers to a property attributable to finite cell cultures namely their inability to grow beyond a finite number of population doublings sometimes referred to as Hayflick s limit . Although cellular senescence was first described using fibroblast like cells most normal human cell types that can be grown successfully in culture undergo cellular senescence. The in vitro lifespan of different cell types varies but the maximum lifespan is typically fewer than 100 population doublings this is the number of doublings for all the cells in the culture to become senescent and thus render the culture unable to divide . Senescence does not depend on chronological time but rather is measured by the number of cell divisions or population doublings the culture has undergone. Thus cells made quiescent by removing essential growth factors are able to resume growth and division when the growth factors are re introduced and thereafter carry out the same number of doublings as equivalent cells grown continuously. Similarly when cells are frozen in liquid nitrogen after various numbers of population doublings and then thawed and cultured they undergo substantially the same number of doublings as cells maintained unfrozen in culture. Senescent cells are not dead or dying cells they are actually resistant to programmed cell death apoptosis and have been maintained in their nondividing state for as long as three years. These cells are very much alive and metabolically active but they do not divide. The nondividing state of senescent cells has not yet been found to be reversible by any biological chemical or viral agent.

As used herein the term Growth medium refers to a culture medium sufficient for expansion of postpartum derived cells. Growth medium preferably contains Dulbecco s Modified Essential Media DMEM .

Several terms are used herein with respect to cell replacement therapy. The terms autologous transfer autologous transplantation autograft and the like refer to treatments wherein the cell donor is also the recipient of the cell replacement therapy. The terms allogeneic transfer allogeneic transplantation allograft and the like refer to treatments wherein the cell donor is of the same species as the recipient of the cell replacement therapy but is not the same individual. A cell transfer in which the donor s cells have been histocompatibly matched with a recipient is sometimes referred to as a syngeneic transfer. The terms xenogeneic transfer xenogeneic transplantation xenograft and the like refer to treatments wherein the cell donor is of a different species than the recipient of the cell replacement therapy.

The term matrix as used herein refers to a support for the PPDCs or PPDC product of the invention for example a scaffold e.g. VNW scaffold foams such as PCL PGA or self assembling peptides such as RAD16 or supporting medium e.g. hydrogel or a biomaterial such as Collagen oxidized regenerated cellulose .

Various patents and other publications are cited herein and throughout the specification each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

In one aspect the invention provides postpartum derived cells PPDCs derived from postpartum tissue substantially free of blood. The PPDCs may be derived from placenta of a mammal including but not limited to human. The cells are capable of self renewal and expansion in culture. The postpartum derived cells have the potential to differentiate into cells of other phenotypes. The invention provides in one of its several aspects cells that are derived from umbilicus as opposed to umbilical cord blood. The invention also provides in one of its several aspects cells that are derived from placental tissue.

The cells have been characterized as to several of their cellular genetic immunological and biochemical properties. For example the cells have been characterized by their growth by their cell surface markers by their gene expression by their ability to produce certain biochemical trophic factors and by their immunological properties.

According to the methods described herein a mammalian placenta and umbilicus are recovered upon or shortly after termination of either a full term or pre term pregnancy for example after expulsion after birth. Postpartum tissue can be obtained from any completed pregnancy full term or less than full term whether delivered vaginally or through other means for example cesarean section. The postpartum tissue may be transported from the birth site to a laboratory in a sterile container such as a flask beaker culture dish or bag. The container may have a solution or medium including but not limited to a salt solution such as for example Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM or phosphate buffered saline PBS or any solution used for transportation of organs used for transplantation such as University of Wisconsin solution or perfluorochemical solution. One or more antibiotic and or antimycotic agents such as but not limited to penicillin streptomycin amphotericin B gentamicin and nystatin may be added to the medium or buffer. The postpartum tissue may be rinsed with an anticoagulant solution such as heparin containing solution. It is preferable to keep the tissue at about 4 10 C. prior to extraction of PPDCs. It is even more preferable that the tissue not be frozen prior to extraction of PPDCs.

Isolation of PPDCs preferably occurs in an aseptic environment. Blood and debris are preferably removed from the postpartum tissue prior to isolation of PPDCs. For example the postpartum tissue may be washed with buffer solution such as but not limited to phosphate buffered saline. The wash buffer also may comprise one or more antimycotic and or antibiotic agents such as but not limited to penicillin streptomycin amphotericin B gentamicin and nystatin.

In some aspects of the invention the different cell types present in postpartum tissue are fractionated into subpopulations from which the PPDCs can be isolated. This may be accomplished using techniques for cell separation including but not limited to enzymatic treatment to dissociate postpartum tissue into its component cells followed by cloning and selection of specific cell types for example but not limited to selection based on morphological and or biochemical markers selective growth of desired cells positive selection selective destruction of unwanted cells negative selection separation based upon differential cell agglutinability in the mixed population as for example with soybean agglutinin freeze thaw procedures differential adherence properties of the cells in the mixed population filtration conventional and zonal centrifugation centrifugal elutriation counter streaming centrifugation unit gravity separation countercurrent distribution electrophoresis and flow cytometry for example fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS .

In a preferred embodiment postpartum tissue comprising a whole placenta or a fragment or section thereof is disaggregated by ultrasonic disruption mechanical force mincing or shear forces enzymatic digestion with single or combinatorial proteolytic enzymes such as a matrix metalloprotease and or neutral protease for example collagenase trypsin dispase LIBERASE Boehringer Mannheim Corp. Indianapolis Ind. hyaluronidase and or pepsin or a combination of mechanical and enzymatic methods. For example the cellular component of the postpartum tissue may be disaggregated by methods using collagenase mediated dissociation. Enzymatic digestion methods preferably employ a combination of enzymes such as a combination of a matrix metalloprotease and a neutral protease. The matrix metalloprotease is preferably a collagenase. The neutral protease is preferably thermolysin or dispase and most preferably is dispase. More preferably enzymatic digestion of postpartum tissue uses a combination of a matrix metalloprotease a neutral protease and a mucolytic enzyme for digestion of hyaluronic acid such as a combination of collagenase dispase and hyaluronidase or a combination of LIBERASE Boehringer Mannheim Corp. Indianapolis Ind. and hyaluronidase. Collagenase may be type 1 2 3 or 4. Other enzymes known in the art for cell isolation include papain deoxyribonucleases serine proteases such as trypsin chymotrypsin or elastase that may be used either on their own or in combination with other enzymes such as matrix metalloproteases mucolytic enzymes and neutral proteases. Serine proteases are preferably used consecutively following use of other enzymes. The temperature and period of time tissues or cells are in contact with serine proteases is particularly important. Serine proteases may be inhibited by alpha 2 microglobulin in serum and therefore the medium used for digestion is usually serum free. EDTA and DNAse are commonly used in enzyme digestion procedures to increase the efficiency of cell recovery. The degree of dilution of the digestion may also greatly affect the cell yield as cells may be trapped within the viscous digest. The LIBERASE Boehringer Mannheim Corp. Indianapolis Ind. Blendzyme Roche series of enzyme combinations are very useful and may be used in the instant methods. Other sources of enzymes are known and the skilled artisan may also obtain such enzymes directly from their natural sources. The skilled artisan is also well equipped to assess new or additional enzymes or enzyme combinations for their utility in isolating the cells of the invention. Preferred enzyme treatments are 0.5 1 1.5 or 2 hours long or longer. In more preferred embodiments the tissue is incubated at 37 C. during the enzyme treatment of the disintegration step.

Postpartum tissue comprising the umbilicus and placenta may be used without separation. Alternatively the umbilicus may be separated from the placenta by any means known in the art. In some embodiments of the invention postpartum tissue is separated into two or more sections such as umbilicus and placenta. In some embodiments of the invention placental tissue is separated into two or more sections each section consisting of predominantly of either neonatal neonatal and maternal or maternal aspect. The separated sections then are dissociated by mechanical and or enzymatic dissociation according to the methods described herein. Cells of neonatal or maternal lineage may be identified by any means known in the art for example by karyotype analysis or in situ hybridization for the Y chromosome. Karyotype analysis also may be used to identify cells of normal karyotype.

Isolated cells or postpartum tissue from which PPDCs grow out may be used to initiate or seed cell cultures. Cells are transferred to sterile tissue culture vessels either uncoated or coated with extracellular matrix or ligands such as laminin collagen gelatin fibronectin ornithine vitronectin and extracellular membrane protein e.g. MATRIGEL BD Discovery Labware Bedford Mass. . PPDCs are cultured in any culture medium capable of sustaining growth of the cells such as but not limited to DMEM high or low glucose Eagle s basal medium Ham s F10 medium F10 Ham s F 12 medium F12 Iscove s modified Dulbecco s medium Mesenchymal Stem Cell Growth Medium MSCGM DMEM F12 RPMI 1640 advanced DMEM Gibco DMEM MCDB201 Sigma and CELL GRO FREE. The culture medium may be supplemented with one or more components including for example serum e.g. fetal bovine serum FBS preferably about 2 15 v v equine serum ES human serum HS beta mercaptoethanol BME preferably about 0.001 v v one or more growth factors for example platelet derived growth factor PDGF insulin like growth factor 1 IGF 1 leukemia inhibitory factor LIF epidermal growth factor EGF fibroblast growth factor FGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and erythropoietin EPO amino acids including L valine and one or more antibiotic and or antimycotic agents to control microbial contamination such as for example penicillin G streptomycin sulfate amphotericin B gentamicin and nystatin either alone or in combination. The culture medium preferably comprises Growth medium DMEM low glucose serum BME an antimycotic agent and an antibiotic agent .

The cells are seeded in culture vessels at a density to allow cell growth. In a preferred embodiment the cells are cultured at about 0 to about 5 percent by volume COin air. In some preferred embodiments the cells are cultured at about 2 to about 25 percent Oin air preferably about 5 to about 20 percent Oin air. The cells preferably are cultured at about 25 to about 40 C. more preferably about 35 C. to about 39 C. and more preferably are cultured at 37 C. The cells are preferably cultured in an incubator. The medium in the culture vessel can be static or agitated for example using a bioreactor. PPDCs preferably are grown under low oxidative stress e.g. with addition of glutathione ascorbic acid catalase tocopherol N acetylcysteine . Low oxidative stress as used herein refers to conditions of no or minimal free radical damage to the cultured cells.

Methods for the selection of the most appropriate culture medium medium preparation and cell culture techniques are well known in the art and are described in a variety of sources including Doyle et al. eds. 1995 C TC LP John Wiley Sons Chichester and Ho and Wang eds. 1991 ACB Butterworth Heinemann Boston which are incorporated herein by reference.

The culture medium is changed as necessary for example by carefully aspirating the medium from the dish for example with a pipette and replenishing with fresh medium. Incubation is continued until a sufficient number or density of cells accumulate in the dish. The original explanted tissue sections may be removed and the remaining cells trypsinized using standard techniques or using a cell scraper. After trypsinization the cells are collected removed to fresh medium and incubated as above. In some embodiments the medium is changed at least once at approximately 24 hours post trypsinization to remove any floating cells. The cells remaining in culture are considered to be PPDCs.

After culturing the isolated cells or tissue fragments for a sufficient period of time PPDCs will have grown out either as a result of migration from the postpartum tissue or cell division or both. In some embodiments of the invention PPDCs are passaged or removed to a separate culture vessel containing fresh medium of the same or a different type as that used initially where the population of cells can be mitotically expanded. PPDCs are preferably passaged up to about 100 confluence more preferably about 70 to about 85 confluence. The lower limit of confluence for passage is understood by one skilled in the art. The PPDCs of the invention may be utilized from the first subculture passage 0 to senescence. The preferable number of passages is that which yields a cell number sufficient for a given application. In certain embodiments the cells are passaged 2 to 25 times preferably 4 to 20 times more preferably 8 to 15 times more preferably 10 or 11 times and most preferably 11 times. Cloning and or subcloning may be performed to confirm that a clonal population of cells has been isolated.

PPDCs may be characterized for example by growth characteristics e.g. population doubling capability doubling time passages to senescence karyotype analysis e.g. normal karyotype maternal or neonatal lineage flow cytometry e.g. FACS analysis immunohistochemistry and or immunocytochemistry e.g. for detection of epitopes including but not limited to vimentin desmin alpha smooth muscle actin cytokeratin 18 von Willebrand factor CD34 GROalpha GCP 2 oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 and NOGO A gene expression profiling e.g. gene chip arrays polymerase chain reaction for example reverse transcriptase PCR real time PCR and conventional PCR protein arrays protein secretion e.g. by plasma clotting assay or analysis of PPDC conditioned medium for example by Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay ELISA antibody analysis e.g. ELISA antibody staining for cell surface markers including but not limited to CD10 CD13 CD31 CD34 CD44 CD45 CD73 CD80 CD86 CD90 CD117 CD141 CD178 platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha PDGFr alpha HLA class I antigens HLA A HLA B HLA C HLA class II antigens HLA DP HLA DQ HLA DR B7 H2 and PD L2 mixed lymphocyte reaction e.g. as measure of stimulation of allogeneic PBMCs and or other methods known in the art.

The homogeneous cell population of the invention may comprise umbilicus or placenta derived cells. Homogeneous populations of umbilicus derived cells may be free of cells of maternal lineage. Homogeneous populations of placenta derived cells may be of neonatal or maternal lineage. Homogeneity of a cell population may be achieved by any method known in the art for example by cell sorting e.g. flow cytometry bead separation or by clonal expansion.

Methods of the invention further include methods for producing a population of postpartum derived cells by expanding a cell of the invention in culture. The postpartum derived cells of the invention preferably expand in the presence of from about 5 to about 20 oxygen. The postpartum derived cells of the invention preferably are expanded in culture medium such as but not limited to Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM mesenchymal stem cell growth medium advanced DMEM Gibco DMEM MCDB201 Sigma RPMI1640 CELL GRO FREE advanced DMEM Gibco DMEM MCDB201 Sigma Ham s F10 medium Ham s F12 medium DMEM F12 Iscove s modified Dulbecco s medium or Eagle s basal medium.

The culture medium may contain at least one of fibroblast growth factor platelet derived growth factor vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor. The cells of the invention may be grown on an uncoated or coated surface. Surfaces for growth of the cells may be coated for example with gelatin collagen e.g. native or denatured fibronectin laminin ornithine vitronectin or extracellular membrane protein e.g. MATRIGEL . In some embodiments a population of postpartum derived cells is mixed with another population of cells.

The cells of the invention can be induced to differentiate to an ectodermal endodermal or mesodermal lineage preferably a mesodermal or ectodermal lineage. For example PPDCs may be induced to differentiate into a given lineage by subjecting them to differentiation inducing cell culture conditions. Also provided herein are populations of cells incubated in the presence of one or more factors or under conditions that stimulate cell differentiation along a desired pathway e.g. toward a soft tissue phenotype such as a muscular endothelial or epithelial phenotype .

Methods to characterize differentiation induced cells of the invention include but are not limited to histological morphological biochemical and immunohistochemical methods or using cell surface markers or genetically or molecularly or by identifying factors secreted by the differentiation induced cell and by the inductive qualities of the differentiation induced PPDCs.

The cells of the invention can be engineered using any of a variety of vectors including but not limited to integrating viral vectors e.g. retrovirus vector or adeno associated viral vectors non integrating replicating vectors e.g. papilloma virus vectors SV40 vectors adenoviral vectors or replication defective viral vectors. Other methods of introducing DNA into cells include the use of liposomes electroporation a particle gun or by direct DNA injection.

Hosts cells are preferably transformed or transfected with a nucleic acid of interest controlled by or in operative association with one or more appropriate expression control elements such as promoter or enhancer sequences internal ribosomal entry sites IREs transcription terminators polyadenylation sites among others and a selectable marker.

Following the introduction of the nucleic acid of interest engineered cells may be allowed to grow in enriched media and then switched to selective media. A selectable marker in the nucleic acid of interest may confer resistance to a selection agent or allow cells to grow in the absence of an otherwise required factor. Cells may stably integrate the DNA of interest into their chromosomes. Cells expressing the DNA of interest may be cloned and expanded into cell lines.

Any promoter may be used to drive the expression of the DNA of interest. For example viral promoters include but are not limited to the CMV promoter enhancer SV40 papillomavirus Epstein Barr virus or elastin gene promoter. Preferably the control elements used to control expression of the gene of interest allow for the regulated expression of the gene so that the product is synthesized only when desired in vivo. If transient expression is desired constitutive promoters are preferably used in a non integrating and or replication defective vector. Alternatively inducible promoters could be used to drive the expression of the gene of interest when necessary.

Inducible promoters include but are not limited to those associated with metallothionein and heat shock proteins.

An expression control element may be tissue specific. An example of a transcriptional control region that exhibits tissue specificity is the myosin light chain 2 gene control region which is active in skeletal muscle Shani 1985314 283 .

The cells of the invention may be genetically engineered to knock out or knock down expression of factors that promote inflammation or rejection at the implant site. Negative modulatory techniques for the reduction of target gene expression levels or target gene product activity levels are discussed below. Negative modulation as used herein refers to a reduction in the level and or activity of target gene product relative to the level and or activity of the target gene product in the absence of the modulatory treatment. The expression of a native gene can be reduced or knocked out using a number of techniques including for example inhibition of expression by inactivating the gene completely commonly termed knockout for example using the homologous recombination technique. Usually an exon encoding an important region of the protein or an exon 5 to that region is interrupted by a positive selectable marker e.g. neo preventing the production of normal mRNA from the target gene and resulting in inactivation of the gene. A gene may also be inactivated by creating a deletion in part of a gene or by deleting the entire gene. By using a construct with two regions of homology to the target gene for example the intervening sequence can be deleted Mombaerts et al. 199188 3084 3087 .

Antisense small interfering RNA DNAzymes and ribozyme molecules which inhibit expression of the target gene can also be used in accordance with the invention to reduce the level of target gene activity. For example antisense RNA molecules which inhibit the expression of major histocompatibility gene complexes HLA have been shown to be most versatile with respect to immune responses. Still further triple helix molecules can be utilized in reducing the level of target gene activity.

These techniques are described in detail by L. G. Davis et al. eds 1994 BMMB2nd ed. Appleton Lange Norwalk Conn. which is incorporated herein by reference.

Using any of the foregoing techniques for example the expression of IL 1 can be knocked out or knocked down in the cells of the invention to reduce the production of inflammatory mediators by the cells of the invention. Likewise the expression of MHC class II molecules can be knocked out or knocked down in order to reduce the risk of rejection of the implanted tissue.

Once the cells of the invention have been genetically engineered they may be administered to a patient to allow for the treatment of a soft tissue condition or to produce an anti inflammatory gene product such as for example peptides or polypeptides corresponding to the idiotype of neutralizing antibodies for GM CSF TNF IL 1 IL 2 or other inflammatory cytokines.

Alternatively the genetically engineered cells may be used to produce new tissue in vitro which is then administered to a subject as described herein.

The secretion of growth factors by PPDCs may provide trophic support for a second cell type in vitro or in vivo. PPDCs may secrete for example at least one of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 MCP 1 interleukin 6 IL6 interleukin 8 IL 8 GCP 2 hepatocyte growth factor HGF keratinocyte growth factor KGF fibroblast growth factor FGF heparin binding epidermal growth factor HB EGF brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF thrombopoietin TPO macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha MIP1a RANTES and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 TIMP1 which can be augmented by a variety of techniques including ex vivo cultivation of the cells in chemically defined medium.

As demonstrated by Example 14 herein PPDCs have the ability to support survival growth and differentiation of other cell types in co culture. The methods of the invention thus also include methods of providing trophic support to a soft tissue cell. The methods may include a step of exposing a soft tissue cell to a PPDC or PPDC product such as PPDC conditioned medium. Examples of cells which may be supported by PPDCs or PPDC products include but are not limited to stem cells myocytes myoblasts keratinocytes melanocytes dermal fibroblasts bone marrow cells adipocytes epithelial cells endothelial cells stromal cells and endothelial cells e.g. aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors . Exposure to or co culture of PPDC or PPDC products with endothelial cells may stimulate angiogenesis by the endothelial cells.

PPDCs or PPDC products are co cultured or exposed in vitro or are administered in vivo to provide trophic support to another cell type including but not limited to epithelial cells e.g. mucosal cells for example cells of oral mucosa gastrointestinal tract nasal epithelium respiratory tract epithelium vaginal epithelium corneal epithelium bone marrow cells adipocytes stem cells keratinocytes vascular endothelial cells e.g. aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors e.g. CD34 CD34 CD117 cells smooth muscle cells myoblasts myocytes stromal cells bladder urothelial cells cells of the larynx esophageal cells and cells of the gastrointestinal tract stem cells and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells and mixtures thereof. For co culture it may be desirable for the PPDCs and the desired other cells to be co cultured under conditions in which the two cell types are in contact. This can be achieved for example by seeding the cells as a heterogeneous population of cells in culture medium or onto a suitable culture substrate. Alternatively the PPDCs can first be grown to confluence and employed as a substrate for the second desired cell type in culture. In this latter embodiment the cells may further be physically separated e.g. by a membrane or similar device such that the other cell type may be removed and used separately following the co culture period. In other embodiments the desired other cells are cultured in contact with a PPDC product such as conditioned medium extracellular matrix and or a cell fraction of PPDCs. In other embodiments matrices comprising PPDCs or PPDC products are administered to provide trophic support to another cell type. Use of PPDCs or PPDC products to promote expansion and or differentiation of other cell types may find applicability in research and in clinical therapeutic areas. For instance such methods may be utilized to facilitate growth and or differentiation of cells of a given phenotype in culture e.g. cells of a soft tissue phenotype for basic research purposes or for use in drug screening assays. The methods may also be utilized for in vitro expansion of cells of a soft tissue phenotype for later administration for therapeutic purposes. For example cells may be harvested from an individual expanded in vitro in co culture with PPDCs or a PPDC product then returned to that individual autologous transfer or another individual syngeneic allogeneic or xenogeneic transfer . In these embodiments it will be appreciated that following in vitro expansion the population of cells comprising the PPDCs or PPDC products could be administered to a patient in need of treatment for example of a soft tissue condition as described herein. Alternatively in situations where autologous transfer is appropriate or desirable the cultured cell populations may be physically separated in culture enabling removal of the autologous cells for administration to the patient.

In some embodiments the culturing methods are performed in vivo. For example PPDCs or a PPDC product may be administered to a patient to provide trophic support to another cell type including but not limited to epithelial cells e.g. mucosal cells for example cells of oral mucosa gastrointestinal tract nasal epithelium respiratory tract epithelium vaginal epithelium corneal epithelium bone marrow cells adipocytes stem cells keratinocytes vascular endothelial cells e.g. aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors e.g. CD34 CD34 CD117 cells smooth muscle cells myoblasts myocytes stromal cells bladder urothelial cells cells of the larynx esophageal cells and cells of the gastrointestinal tract and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells and mixtures thereof.

In some embodiments PPDCs or PPDC products induce angiogenesis in co culture with cells such as but not limited to epithelial cells e.g. mucosal cells for example cells of oral mucosa gastrointestinal tract nasal epithelium respiratory tract epithelium vaginal epithelium corneal epithelium bone marrow cells adipocytes stem cells keratinocytes vascular endothelial cells e.g. aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors e.g. CD34 CD34 CD117 cells smooth muscle cells myoblasts myocytes stromal cells bladder urothelial cells cells of the larynx esophageal cells and cells of the gastrointestinal tract and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells. For example angiogenic factors including but not limited to EPO TIMP1 ANG2 PDGF bb TPO KGF HGF FGF VEGF and HBEGF are released by PPDCs. In some embodiments methods of inducing angiogenesis according to the invention include exposing a soft tissue cell or population thereof to a PPDC or PPDC product in vitro or in vivo. Examples of soft tissue cells that form endothelial networks in accordance with the methods of the invention include aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors e.g. CD34 CD34 CD117 cells . Where the method is performed in vivo PPDCs or PPDC products may be administered to a patient as described herein. For example a PPDC population or product may be administered to a patient to provide needed angiogenic factors.

PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention may be used to produce a vascular network as demonstrated in Example 14. Methods of producing a vascular network involve exposing e.g. contacting a population of soft tissue cells to PPDCs or a PPDC product such as a cell fraction e.g. lysate or soluble cell fraction thereof extracellular matrix or conditioned medium. The population of soft tissue cells preferably contains at least one soft tissue cell of an aortic endothelial cell coronary artery endothelial cell pulmonary artery endothelial cell iliac artery endothelial cell microvascular endothelial cell umbilical artery endothelial cell and umbilical vein endothelial cell. The method of producing a vascular network may be performed in vitro or in vivo. Also included within the scope of the invention are the vascular networks so produced. The vascular networks of the invention may be administered to a patient as a therapeutic regimen. In some preferred embodiments the vascular networks are administered as treatment of a soft tissue condition for example but not by way of limitation a vascular condition such as a vascular disease or injury or improper vascular development. In some aspects of the invention the vascular network is administered by transplantation to the patient. In preferred embodiments damaged or diseased vasculature is removed prior to administration of the vascular network of the invention.

Another embodiment of the invention features use of differentiation induced or undifferentiated PPDCs for production of conditioned medium. Such conditioned media are contemplated for use in in vitro culture of cells for example stem or soft tissue progenitor cells or cells of a soft tissue phenotype including but not limited to epithelial cells e.g. cells of oral mucosa gastrointestinal tract nasal epithelium respiratory tract epithelium vaginal epithelium corneal epithelium bone marrow cells adipocytes keratinocytes vascular endothelial cells e.g. aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors e.g. CD34 CD34 CD117 cells myoblasts myocytes stromal cells and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells and mixtures thereof or in vivo to support transplanted cells comprising homogeneous or heterogeneous populations of PPDCs or stem or progenitor cells and or cells of a soft tissue phenotype epithelial cells e.g. cells of oral mucosa gastrointestinal tract nasal epithelium respiratory tract epithelium vaginal epithelium corneal epithelium bone marrow cells adipocytes keratinocytes vascular endothelial cells e.g. aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors e.g. CD34 CD34 CD117 cells myoblasts myocytes stromal cells and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells and mixtures thereof for example. PPDC conditioned medium also may be administered in vivo to support the growth maintenance and or differentiation of endogenous cells.

PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention may be used to treat patients having a soft tissue condition for example but not limited to patients requiring the repair or replacement of soft tissue resulting from disease or trauma or failure of the tissue to develop normally or to provide a cosmetic function such as to augment features of the body. The treatment may comprise at least one of soft tissue repair reconstruction bulking cosmetic treatment therapeutic treatment tissue augmentation and tissue sealing. Provided herein are methods of treating soft tissue conditions in a patient by administering to the patient PPDCs and or PPDC products of the invention. Therapeutic applications of the PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention include but are not limited to treatment of hernias congenital defects damage to the pelvic floor tear or rupture of a tendon or ligament a traumatic wound skin repair and regeneration e.g. scar revision or the treatment of traumatic wounds burns skin ulcers e.g. decubitus pressure ulcers venous ulcers and diabetic ulcers and surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers treatment of vascular conditions e.g. vascular disease such as peripheral arterial disease abdominal aortic aneurysm carotid disease and venous disease vascular injury improper vascular development and muscle diseases e.g. congenital myopathies myasthenia gravis inflammatory neurogenic and myogenic muscle diseases and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy Becker muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy limb girdle muscular dystrophy facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy congenital muscular dystrophies oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy distal muscular dystrophy and Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy breast reconstruction and bladder augmentation.

Also provided by the invention are methods of treating a patient in need of angiogenic factors comprising administering to the patient the PPDCs or PPDC products e.g. conditioned medium of the invention.

The PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention may be administered alone or as admixtures with other cells. For example the PPDCs and PPDC products may be administered by way of a matrix. A matrix of the invention may comprise a three dimensional scaffold. Scaffolds of the invention may be particulate flat tubular single layered or multilayered. The PPDCs and PPDC products may be administered with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Where PPDCs are to be administered with other cells the PPDCs may be administered simultaneously or sequentially with the other cells. Where cells are to be administered sequentially with other cell types the PPDCs may be administered before or after the cells of a second phenotype. Cells which may be administered in conjunction with PPDCs include epithelial cells e.g. cells of oral mucosa gastrointestinal tract nasal epithelium respiratory tract epithelium vaginal epithelium corneal epithelium bone marrow cells adipocytes stem cells keratinocytes vascular endothelial cells e.g. aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors e.g. CD34 CD34 CD117 cells myoblasts myocytes stromal cells bladder urothelial cells smooth muscle cells gastrointestinal cells esophageal cells larynx cells mucosal cells and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells.

The PPDCs and PPDC products may be administered with other beneficial drugs or biological molecules e.g. growth factors trophic factors . The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise PPDCs and or PPDC products and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In preferred embodiments the pharmaceutical compositions comprise PPDCs and or PPDC products in an effective amount to treat a soft tissue condition. When administered with other agents the PPDCs and or PPDC products may be administered together in a single pharmaceutical composition or in separate pharmaceutical compositions simultaneously or sequentially with the other bioactive factor either before or after administration of the other agents . Bioactive factors which may be co administered include anti apoptotic agents e.g. EPO EPO mimetibody TPO IGF I and IGF II HGF caspase inhibitors anti inflammatory agents e.g. p38 MAPK inhibitors TGF beta inhibitors statins IL 6 and IL 1 inhibitors pemirolast tranilast REMICADE and NSAIDs non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs e.g. tepoxalin tolmetin suprofen immunosupressive immunomodulatory agents e.g. calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine tacrolimus mTOR inhibitors e.g. sirolimus everolimus anti proliferatives e.g. azathioprine mycophenolate mofetil corticosteroids e.g. prednisolone hydrocortisone antibodies such as monoclonal anti IL 2Ralpha receptor antibodies e.g. basiliximab daclizumab polyclonal anti T cell antibodies e.g. anti thymocyte globulin ATG anti lymphocyte globulin ALG monoclonal anti T cell antibody OKT3 anti thrombogenic agents e.g. heparin heparin derivatives urokinase PPack dextrophenylalanine proline arginine chloromethylketone antithrombin compounds platelet receptor antagonists anti thrombin antibodies anti platelet receptor antibodies aspirin dipyridamole protamine hirudin prostaglandin inhibitors and platelet inhibitors and anti oxidants e.g. probucol vitamin A ascorbic acid tocopherol coenzyme Q 10 glutathione L cysteine N acetylcysteine . as well as local anesthetics. As another example the cells may be co administered with scar inhibitory factor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 827 735 incorporated herein by reference.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may comprise in addition to the PPDC or PPDC product at least one other cell type. For example pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may comprise a soft tissue cell. Examples of the at least one other cell type to be included in the pharmaceutical compositions of PPDCs and or PPDC products of the invention include stem cells epithelial cells dermal fibroblasts melanocytes keratinocytes and other epithelial progenitor cells myocytes myoblasts and muscle cells e.g. smooth muscle cells endothelial cells and stromal cells.

In some embodiments PPDCs are administered as undifferentiated cells i.e. as cultured in Growth medium.

The PPDCs and related products of the invention may be surgically implanted injected engrafted delivered e.g. by way of a catheter or syringe or otherwise administered directly or indirectly to the site in need of repair or augmentation. PPDCs and PPDC products may be administered by way of a matrix e.g. a three dimensional scaffold or via injectable viscoelastic supplements such as hyaluronic acid alginates self assembling peptides hydrogels and collagen. PPDCs and PPDC products may be administered with conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Routes of administration of PPDCs and PPDC products include intramuscular intravenous intraarterial intraperitoneal subcutaneous oral and nasal administration. Preferable routes of in vivo administration include transplantation implantation injection delivery via a catheter microcatheter suture stent microparticle pump or any other means known in the art.

When PPDCs or PPDC products are administered in semi solid or solid devices surgical implantation into a precise location in the body is typically a suitable means of administration. Liquid or fluid pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to a more general location e.g. throughout a diffusely affected area for example from which PPDCs or PPDC products migrate to a particular location e.g. by responding to chemical signals.

Dosage forms and regimes for administering PPDCs or PPDC products described herein are developed in accordance with good medical practice taking into account the condition of the individual patient e.g. nature and extent of the condition being treated age sex body weight and general medical condition and other factors known to medical practitioners. Thus the effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition to be administered to a patient is determined by these considerations as known in the art.

In some embodiments of the invention it may not be necessary or desirable to immunosuppress a patient prior to initiation of PPDC or PPDC product based therapy. PPDCs have been shown not to stimulate allogeneic PBMCs in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Accordingly transplantation with allogeneic or even xenogeneic PPDCs may be tolerated.

It may be desirable to pharmacologically immunosuppress a patient prior to initiating PPDC or PPDC product based therapy. This may be accomplished through the use of systemic or local immunosuppressive agents or it may be accomplished by delivering the PPDCs in an encapsulated device. PPDCs may be encapsulated in a capsule that is permeable to nutrients and oxygen required by the cell and therapeutic factors the cell is yet impermeable to immune humoral factors and cells. Preferably the encapsulant is hypoallergenic is easily and stably situated in a target tissue and provides added protection to the implanted structure. PPDCs also may be genetically modified to reduce their immunogenicity.

Survival of transplanted PPDCs in a living patient can be determined through the use of a variety of scanning techniques e.g. computerized axial tomography CAT or CT scan magnetic resonance imaging MRI or positron emission tomography PET scans. Determination of transplant survival can also be done by removing a section of the target tissue and examining it for example visually or through a microscope. Alternatively cells can be treated with stains that are specific for cells of a given lineage. Transplanted cells can also be identified by prior incorporation of tracer dyes such as rhodamine or fluorescein labeled microspheres fast blue bisbenzamide ferric microparticles or genetically introduced reporter gene products such as beta galactosidase or beta glucuronidase.

Functional integration of transplanted PPDCs into a subject can be assessed by examining restoration of the function that was damaged or diseased for example restoration of joint function blood flow muscle contraction etc. or augmentation of function.

Compositions of PPDCs and related products e.g. extracellular matrix cell fraction secreted factors conditioned medium including for example pharmaceutical compositions are included within the scope of the invention. Compositions of the invention may include one or more bioactive factors for example but not limited to a growth factor a differentiation inducing factor a cell survival factor such as caspase inhibitor an anti inflammatory agent such as p38 kinase inhibitor or an angiogenic factor such as VEGF or bFGF. Some examples of bioactive factors include PDGF bb EGF bFGF IGF 1 and LIF. In some embodiments undifferentiated or differentiation induced PDPCs are cultured in contact with the bioactive factor. In some embodiments undifferentiated PPDCs remain undifferentiated upon contact with the bioactive factor. In other embodiments the bioactive factor induces differentiation of the PPDCs.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may comprise homogeneous or heterogeneous populations of differentiated and or undifferentiated PPDCs or PPDC products in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable which do not deleteriously react with the cells of the invention or related products. To the extent they are biocompatible suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include water salt solution such as Ringer s solution alcohols oils gelatins and carbohydrates such as lactose amylose or starch fatty acid esters hydroxymethylcellulose hyaluronic acid and polyvinyl pyrolidine. Such preparations can be sterilized and if desired mixed with auxiliary agents such as lubricants preservatives stabilizers wetting agents emulsifiers salts for influencing osmotic pressure buffers and coloring. Pharmaceutical carriers suitable for use in the present invention are known in the art and are described for example in Pharmaceutical Sciences 17Ed. Mack Pub. Co. Easton Pa. and WO 96 05309 each of which are incorporated by reference herein.

The compositions may be delivered in the form of a spray suspension solution dry powder cream ointment or gel.

The dosage e.g. the number of cells to be administered and frequency of administration of the pharmaceutical compositions will depend upon a number of factors including but not limited to the nature of the condition to be treated the extent of the symptoms of the condition characteristics of the patient e.g. age size gender health .

For example but not by way of limitation PPDCs extracellular matrices or cell fractions thereof conditioned medium matrices vascular networks and compositions produced according to the invention may be used to repair or replace underdeveloped damaged or destroyed soft tissue to augment existing soft tissue to introduce new or altered tissue to modify artificial prostheses or to join biological tissues or structures. For example some embodiments of the invention include i hernia closures with replacement soft tissue constructs grown in three dimensional cultures ii skin grafts with soft tissue constructs iii prostheses iv blood vessel grafts and v tendon or ligament reconstruction. Examples of such conditions that can be treated according to the methods of the invention include congenital anomalies such as hemifacial microsomia malar and zygomatic hypoplasia unilateral mammary hypoplasia pectus excavatum pectoralis agenesis Poland s anomaly and velopharyngeal incompetence secondary to cleft palate repair or submucous cleft palate as a retropharyngeal implant acquired defects post traumatic post surgical post infectious such as scars subcutaneous atrophy e.g. secondary to discoid lupus erythematosus keratotic lesions acne pitting of the face linear scleroderma with subcutaneous atrophy saddle nose deformity Romberg s disease and unilateral vocal cord paralysis cosmetic defects such as glabellar frown lines deep nasolabial creases circum oral geographical wrinkles sunken cheeks and mammary hypoplasia hernias tears or ruptures of a tendon or ligament severe burns skin ulcers e.g. decubitus pressure ulcers venous ulcers and diabetic ulcers and surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers vascular diseases such as peripheral arterial disease abdominal aortic aneurysm carotid disease and venous disease muscle diseases e.g. congenital myopathies myasthenia gravis inflammatory neurogenic and myogenic muscle diseases and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy Becker muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy limb girdle muscular dystrophy facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy congenital muscular dystrophies oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy distal muscular dystrophy and Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and replacement and repair of connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments.

The successful repair or replacement of damaged tissue can be enhanced if the implanted cells and or tissue can be fixed in place at the site of repair. Post implantation movement may cause the new cells or tissue to become dislodged from the site if a pro active fixation technique is not employed. Various methods can be used to fix the new cells and or tissue in place including patches derived from biocompatible tissues which can be placed over the site biodegradable sutures hollow sutures porous sutures or other fasteners e.g. pins staples tacks screws and anchors non absorbable fixation devices e.g. sutures pins screws and anchors adhesives and the use of interference fit geometries.

The PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention may be administered alone in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier through a catheter or microcatheter via a pump or spray or on or in a matrix as described herein.

The treatment methods of the subject invention involve the implantation of PPDCs PPDC products or trans differentiated cells into individuals in need thereof. PPDCs or PPDC products of the present invention may be delivered to the site of therapeutic need or home to the site.

The cells of the present invention may be differentiated in vitro prior to implantation in a patient. In vitro differentiation allows for controlled application of bioactive factors. Alternatively the cells of the present invention may differentiate in situ or provide trophic support to endogenous cells. The appropriate cell implantation dosage in humans can be determined from existing information relating to e.g. the activity of the cells. From in vitro culture and in vivo animal experiments the amount of factors produced can be quantitated. This information is also useful in calculating an appropriate dosage of implanted material. Additionally the patient can be monitored to determine if additional implantation can be made or implanted material reduced accordingly.

To enhance vascularization and survival of the transplanted cells angiogenic factors such as VEGF PDGF or bFGF can be added either alone or in combination with endothelial cells or their progenitors including CD34 CD34 CD117 cells.

One or more other components may be co administered including selected extracellular matrix components such as one or more types of collagen known in the art and or growth factors platelet rich plasma and drugs. Alternatively the cells of the invention may be genetically engineered to express and produce growth factors. Bioactive factors which may be usefully incorporated into the cell formulation include anti apoptotic agents e.g. EPO EPO mimetibody TPO IGF I and IGF II HGF caspase inhibitors anti inflammatory agents e.g. p38 MAPK inhibitors TGF beta inhibitors statins IL 6 and IL 1 inhibitors pemirolast tranilast REMICADE and NSAIDs non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs e.g. tepoxalin tolmetin suprofen immunosupressive immunomodulatory agents e.g. calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine tacrolimus mTOR inhibitors e.g. sirolimus everolimus anti proliferatives e.g. azathioprine mycophenolate mofetil corticosteroids e.g. prednisolone hydrocortisone antibodies such as monoclonal anti IL 2Ralpha receptor antibodies e.g. basiliximab daclizumab polyclonal anti T cell antibodies e.g. anti thymocyte globulin ATG anti lymphocyte globulin ALG monoclonal anti T cell antibody OKT3 anti thrombogenic agents e.g. heparin heparin derivatives urokinase PPack dextrophenylalanine proline arginine chloromethylketone antithrombin compounds platelet receptor antagonists anti thrombin antibodies anti platelet receptor antibodies aspirin dipyridamole protamine hirudin prostaglandin inhibitors and platelet inhibitors and anti oxidants e.g. probucol vitamin A ascorbic acid tocopherol coenzyme Q 10 glutathione L cysteine N acetylcysteine as well as local anesthetics. As another example the cells may be co administered with scar inhibitory factor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 827 735 incorporated herein by reference.

In a non limiting embodiment a formulation comprising PPDCs or PPDC products of the invention is prepared for administration directly to the site where the new soft tissue is desired. In some embodiments the support for the PPDCs or PPDC products of the invention is biodegradable. As an example of a formulation of the invention and not by way of limitation PPDCs or PPDC products of the invention may be suspended in a hydrogel solution for injection. Examples of suitable hydrogels for use in the invention include self assembling peptides such as RAD16. Alternatively the hydrogel solution may be allowed to harden for instance in a mold to form a matrix having PPDCs or PPDC products dispersed therein prior to implantation. Or once the matrix has hardened the cell formulations may be cultured so that the cells are mitotically expanded prior to implantation. Hydrogels are organic polymers natural or synthetic which are cross linked via covalent ionic or hydrogen bonds to create a three dimensional open lattice structure which entraps water molecules to form a gel. Examples of materials which can be used to form a hydrogel include polysaccharides such as alginate and salts thereof peptides polyphosphazines and polyacrylates which are crosslinked ionically carboxymethyl cellulose CMC oxidized regenerated cellulose ORC or block polymers such as polyethylene oxide polypropylene glycol block copolymers which are crosslinked by temperature or pH respectively. In some embodiments of the invention the formulation comprises an in situ polymerizable gel as described for example in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2002 0022676 Anseth et al. 78 1 3 199 209 2002 Wang et al. 24 22 3969 80 2003 . Methods of synthesis of the hydrogel materials as well as methods for preparing such hydrogels are known in the art.

Other components may also be included in the formulation including but not limited to any of the following 1 buffers to provide appropriate pH and isotonicity 2 lubricants 3 viscous materials to retain the cells at or near the site of administration including for example alginates agars and plant gums and 4 other cell types that may produce a desired effect at the site of administration such as for example enhancement or modification of the formation of tissue or its physicochemical characteristics or as support for the viability of the cells or inhibition of inflammation or rejection. The cells may be covered by an appropriate wound covering to prevent cells from leaving the site. Such wound coverings are known to those of skill in the art.

Bioactive factors which may be usefully incorporated into the formulations of the invention include anti apoptotic agents e.g. EPO EPO mimetibody TPO IGF I and IGF II HGF caspase inhibitors anti inflammatory agents e.g. p38 MAPK inhibitors TGF beta inhibitors statins IL 6 and IL 1 inhibitors pemirolast tranilast REMICADE and NSAIDs non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs e.g. tepoxalin tolmetin suprofen immunosupressive immunomodulatory agents e.g. calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine tacrolimus mTOR inhibitors e.g. sirolimus everolimus anti proliferatives e.g. azathioprine mycophenolate mofetil corticosteroids e.g. prednisolone hydrocortisone antibodies such as monoclonal anti IL 2Ralpha receptor antibodies e.g. basiliximab daclizumab polyclonal anti T cell antibodies e.g. anti thymocyte globulin ATG anti lymphocyte globulin ALG monoclonal anti T cell antibody OKT3 anti thrombogenic agents e.g. heparin heparin derivatives urokinase PPack dextrophenylalanine proline arginine chloromethylketone antithrombin compounds platelet receptor antagonists anti thrombin antibodies anti platelet receptor antibodies aspirin dipyridamole protamine hirudin prostaglandin inhibitors and platelet inhibitors and anti oxidants e.g. probucol vitamin A ascorbic acid tocopherol coenzyme Q 10 glutathione L cysteine N acetylcysteine as well as local anesthetics. As another example the cells may be co administered with scar inhibitory factor as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 827 735 incorporated herein by reference.

Cultures or co cultures of PPDCs in a pre shaped well enables the manufacture of a soft tissue patch of pre determined thickness and volume. The volume of the resulting tissue patch is dependent upon the volume of the well and upon the number of PPDCs in the well. Tissue of optimal pre determined volume may be prepared by routine experimentation by altering either or both of the aforementioned parameters.

The cell contacting surface of the well may be coated with a molecule that discourages adhesion of PPDCs to the cell contacting surface. Preferred coating reagents include silicon based reagents i.e. dichlorodimethylsilane or polytetrafluoroethylene based reagents i.e. TEFLON. Procedures for coating materials with silicon based reagents specifically dichlorodimethylsilane are well known in the art. See for example Sambrook et al. 1989 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. It is appreciated that other biocompatible reagents that prevent the attachment of cells to the surface of the well may be useful in the practice of the instant invention.

Alternatively the well may be cast from a pliable or moldable biocompatible material that does not permit attachment of cells per se. Preferred materials that prevent such cell attachment include but are not limited to agarose glass untreated cell culture plastic and polytetrafluoroethylene i.e. TEFLON. Untreated cell culture plastics i.e. plastics that have not been treated with or made from materials that have an electrostatic charge are commercially available and may be purchased for example from Falcon Labware Becton Dickinson Lincoln Park N.J. The aforementioned materials however are not meant to be limiting. It is appreciated that any other pliable or moldable biocompatible material that inherently discourages the attachment of PPDCs may be useful in the practice of the instant invention.

The size and shape of the well may be determined by the size and shape of the tissue defect to be repaired. The well should be deep enough to contain culture medium overlaying the tissue patch.

It is contemplated that a tissue patch prepared in accordance with the invention may be trimmed or configured to a pre selected size and or shape by a surgeon performing surgical repair of the damaged tissue. Trimming may be performed with the use of a sharp cutting implement i.e. a scalpel a pair of scissors or an arthroscopic device fitted with a cutting edge using procedures well known in the art.

The pre shaped well may be cast in a block of agarose gel under aseptic conditions. Agarose is an economical biocompatible pliable and moldable material that can be used to cast pre shaped wells quickly and easily. As mentioned above the dimensions of the well may dependent upon the size of the resulting tissue plug that is desired.

A pre shaped well may be prepared by pouring a hot solution of molten LT agarose BioRad Richmond Calif. into a tissue culture dish containing a cylinder the cylinder having dimensions that mirror the shape of the well to be formed. The size and shape of the well may be chosen by the artisan and may be dependent upon the shape of the tissue defect to be repaired. Once the agarose has cooled and solidified around the cylinder the cylinder is carefully removed with forceps. The surface of the tissue culture dish that is exposed by the removal of the cylinder is covered with molten agarose. This seals the bottom of the well. When the newly added molten LT agarose cools and solidifies the resulting pre shaped well is suitable for culturing and or inducing the differentiation of PPDCs. It is appreciated however that alternative methods may be used to prepare a pre shaped well useful in the practice of the invention.

PPDCs in suspension may be seeded into and cultured in the pre shaped well. The PPDCs may be induced to differentiate to a soft tissue phenotype in culture in the well or may have been induced to differentiate prior to seeding in the well. The cells may be diluted by the addition of culture medium to a cell density of about 1 10to 1 10PPDCs per milliliter.

Once the cells form a cohesive patch the cohesive plug of cells may be removed from the well and surgically implanted into the tissue defect. It is anticipated that undifferentiated PPDCs may differentiate in situ thereby to form tissue in vivo.

In some embodiments PPDCs are used to generate cell sheets. The sheets may be multilayered as described in Shimizu et al. 24 13 2309 2316 2003 .

Soft tissue defects may be identified by any means known in the art for example but not limited to computer aided tomography CAT scanning X ray examination or magnetic resonance imaging MRI . Defects in soft tissue also are readily identifiable visually during arthroscopic examination or during open surgery. Treatment of the defects can be effected during an orthoscopic or open surgical procedure using the methods and compositions disclosed herein.

Accordingly once the defect has been identified the defect may be treated by 1 surgically implanting at the pre determined site a tissue patch prepared by the methodologies described herein and 2 permitting the tissue patch to integrate into pre determined site.

The tissue patch optimally has a size and shape such that when the patch is implanted into the defect the edges of the implanted tissue contact directly the edges of the defect. In addition the tissue patch may be fixed in place during the surgical procedure. This can be effected by surgically fixing the patch into the defect with biodegradable sutures and or by applying a bioadhesive to the region interfacing the patch and the defect.

In some instances diseased damaged or underdeveloped tissue may be surgically excised prior to implantation of the patch of synthetic tissue. A synthetic tissue patch is implanted subsequently into the defect by the methods described above.

The cells of the invention or co cultures thereof may be seeded onto a scaffold such as a three dimensional scaffold and implanted in vivo where the seeded cells will proliferate on or in the framework and form a replacement tissue in vivo in cooperation with the cells of the patient.

Growth of PPDCs or co cultures thereof on the framework results in the formation of a tissue which can be utilized in vivo as a corrective or supplemental structure. For example and not by way of limitation the scaffolds of the invention can be used to form tubular structures like those of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts as well as blood vessels tissues for hernia repair tendons and ligaments.

In accordance with some embodiments of the invention PPDCs or co cultures thereof are inoculated and grown on a three dimensional framework. The framework may be configured into the shape of the corrective structure desired. When grown in this three dimensional system the proliferating cells mature and segregate properly to form components of adult tissues analogous to counterparts found naturally in vivo.

Some embodiments of the invention provide a matrix for implantation into a patient. In some embodiments the matrix is seeded with a population of postpartum derived cells of the invention. The PPDCs may be differentiation induced or undifferentiated. The PPDC population may be homogeneous or heterogeneous. The matrix may also be inoculated with cells of another desired cell type for example but not by way of limitation epithelial cells e.g. cells of oral mucosa gastrointestinal tract nasal epithelium respiratory tract epithelium vaginal epithelium corneal epithelium bone marrow cells adipocytes stem cells keratinocytes melanocytes dermal fibroblasts vascular endothelial cells e.g. aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors e.g. CD34 CD34 CD117 cells myoblasts myocytes stromal cells and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells. The matrix may contain or be pre treated with one or more bioactive factors including for example drugs anti inflammatory agents antiapoptotic agents and growth factors. In some aspects of the invention the matrix is inoculated with PPDC products of the invention including for example extracellular matrix secreted factors or cell fractions of the PPDCs. In some embodiments the matrix is biodegradable. In some embodiments the matrix comprises extracellular membrane proteins for example MATRIGEL. In some aspects of the invention the matrix comprises natural or synthetic polymers. Matrices of the invention include biocompatible scaffolds lattices self assembling structures and the like whether biodegradable or not liquid or solid. Such matrices are known in the arts of cell based therapy surgical repair tissue engineering and wound healing. Preferably the matrices are pretreated e.g. seeded inoculated contacted with with PPDCs or PPDC products e.g. extracellular matrix conditioned medium secreted factors cell fraction or combination thereof of the invention. More preferably PPDCs or PPDC products are in close association to the matrix or its spaces. In some aspects of the invention the cells or PPDC products adhere to the matrix. In some embodiments the cells or cell products are contained within or bridge interstitial spaces of the matrix. Most preferred are those seeded matrices wherein PPDCs or PPDC products are in close association with the matrix and which when used therapeutically induce or support ingrowth of the patient s cells and or proper angiogenesis. The seeded or pre treated matrices can be introduced into a patient s body in any way known in the art including but not limited to implantation injection surgical attachment transplantation with other tissue and the like. The matrices of the invention may be configured for use in vivo for example to the shape and or size of a tissue or organ in vivo. The scaffolds of the invention may be flat or tubular or may comprise sections thereof as described herein. The scaffolds of the invention may be multilayered.

For example but not by way of limitation the scaffold may be designed such that the scaffold structure 1 supports the PPDCs or PPDC products without subsequent degradation 2 supports the PPDCs or PPDC products from the time of seeding until the scaffold is remodeled by the host tissue or 3 allows the seeded cells to attach proliferate and develop into a tissue structure having sufficient mechanical integrity to support itself in vitro at which point the scaffold is degraded. A review of scaffold design is provided by Hutmacher 12 1 107 124 2001 .

Scaffolds of the invention can be administered in combination with any one or more growth factors cells drugs or other components described above that stimulate soft tissue formation or stimulate vascularization or innervation thereof or otherwise enhance or improve the practice of the invention.

The cells of the invention can be grown freely in a culture vessel to sub confluency or confluency lifted from the culture and inoculated onto a three dimensional framework. Inoculation of the three dimensional framework with a high concentration of cells e.g. approximately 10to 5 10cells per milliliter will result in the establishment of the three dimensional support in relatively shorter periods of time.

In some embodiments it is important to re create in culture the cellular microenvironment found in vivo such that the extent to which the cells of the invention are grown prior to in vivo administration or use in vitro may vary. PPDCs co cultures thereof or PPDC products may be inoculated onto the framework before or after forming the desired shape e.g. ropes tubes filaments. Following inoculation of cells onto the framework the framework is preferably incubated in an appropriate growth medium. During the incubation period the inoculated cells will grow and envelop the framework and will bridge any interstitial spaces therein. It is preferable but not required to grow the cells to an appropriate degree which reflects the in vivo cell density of the tissue being repaired or regenerated.

Examples of scaffolds which may be used in the present invention include nonwoven mats porous foams sutures beads microparticles or hydrogels. Nonwoven mats may for example be formed using fibers comprised of poly lactic acid co glycolic acid polymer 10 90 PLGA referred to herein as VNW available for purchase through Biomedical Structures Slatersville R.I. . Foams composed of for example poly epsilon caprolactone poly glycolic acid PCL PGA copolymer formed by processes such as freeze drying or lyophilization as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 355 699 are also possible scaffolds. Hydrogels such as self assembling peptides e.g. RAD16 may also be used. Another embodiment of a scaffold or matrix of the invention comprises collagen ORC CMC or ORC. These materials are frequently used as supports for growth of tissue. In some embodiments the scaffold is lyophilized prior to use. In some embodiments lyophilized scaffolds are rehydrated with saline for example prior to use. According to a preferred embodiment the framework is a felt which can be composed of a multifilament yarn made from a bioabsorbable material e.g. PGA PLA PCL copolymers or blends or hyaluronic acid. The yarn is made into a felt using standard textile processing techniques consisting of crimping cutting carding and needling.

In another preferred embodiment PPDCs and PPDC products of the invention are seeded onto foam scaffolds that may be composite structures. In addition the three dimensional framework may be molded into a useful shape such as a specific structure in the body to be repaired replaced or augmented.

The framework may be treated prior to inoculation to enhance attachment of the PPDCs or PPDC products. For example prior to inoculation nylon matrices could be treated with 0.1 molar acetic acid and incubated in polylysine PBS and or collagen to coat the nylon. Polystyrene could be similarly treated using sulfuric acid.

In addition the external surfaces of the three dimensional framework may be modified to improve the attachment or growth of cells and differentiation of tissue such as by plasma coating the framework or addition of one or more proteins e.g. collagens elastic fibers reticular fibers glycoproteins glycosaminoglycans e.g. heparin sulfate chondroitin 4 sulfate chondroitin 6 sulfate dermatan sulfate keratin sulfate a cellular matrix and or other materials such as but not limited to gelatin alginates agar agarose and plant gums among others.

In some embodiments the scaffold is comprised of or is treated with materials that render it non thrombogenic. These treatments and materials may also promote and sustain endothelial growth migration and extracellular matrix deposition. Examples of these materials and treatments include but are not limited to natural materials such as basement membrane proteins such as laminin and Type IV collagen synthetic materials such as ePTFE and segmented polyurethaneurea silicones such as PURSPAN The Polymer Technology Group Inc. Berkeley Calif. . These materials can be further treated to render the scaffold non thrombogenic. Such treatments include anti thrombotic agents such as heparin and treatments which alter the surface charge of the material such as plasma coating.

Different proportions of the various types of collagen for example deposited on the framework can affect the growth of tissue specific or other cells which may be later inoculated onto the framework or which may grow onto the structure in vivo. For example for three dimensional skin culture systems collagen types I and III are preferably deposited in the initial matrix. Alternatively the framework can be inoculated with a mixture of cells which synthesize the appropriate collagen types desired. Thus depending upon the tissue to be cultured the appropriate collagen type to be inoculated on the framework or produced by the cells seeded thereon may be selected. For example the relative amounts of collagenic and elastic fibers present in the framework can be modulated by controlling the ratio of collagen producing cells to elastin producing cells in the initial inoculum. For example since the inner walls of arteries are rich in elastin an arterial scaffold should contain a co culture of smooth muscle cells which secrete elastin.

The seeded or inoculated three dimensional framework of the invention can be used in a variety of applications. These include but are not limited to transplantation or implantation of either the cultured cells obtained from the matrix or the cultured matrix itself in vivo. The three dimensional scaffolds may according to the invention be used to replace or augment existing tissue to introduce new or altered tissue to modify artificial prostheses or to join together biological tissues or structures. For example and not by way of limitation specific embodiments of the invention include but are not limited to flat structures and tubular three dimensional tissue implants for repair or regeneration for example of the gastrointestinal tract genitourinary tract blood vessels muscles ligaments tendons skin pelvic floor fascia and hernias.

PPDCs and PPDC products can be inoculated onto a flat scaffold. The scaffold is preferably incubated in culture medium prior to implantation. Two or more flat frameworks can be laid atop another and sutured together to generate a multilayer framework.

For example and not by way of limitation the three dimensional framework can be used to construct single and multi layer tubular tissues in vitro that can serve as a replacement for damaged or diseased tubular tissue in vivo.

The following subsections describe the use of a seeded framework to prepare tubes comprising PPDCs and or PPDC products that can be implanted into the body.

A scaffold can be cut into a strip e.g. rectangular in shape of which the width is approximately equal to the inner circumference of the tubular organ into which it will ultimately be inserted. The cells can be inoculated onto the scaffold and incubated by floating or suspending in liquid media. At the appropriate stage of confluence the scaffold can be rolled up into a tube by joining the long edges together. The seam can be closed by suturing the two edges together using fibers of a suitable material of an appropriate diameter.

According to the invention a scaffold can be formed as a tube inoculated with PPDCs or PPDC products and suspended in media in an incubation chamber. In order to prevent occlusion of the lumen one of the open ends of the tubular framework can be affixed to a nozzle. Liquid media can be forced through this nozzle from a source chamber connected to the incubation chamber to create a current through the interior of the tubular framework. The other open end can be affixed to an outflow aperture which leads into a collection chamber from which the media can be recirculated through the source chamber. The tube can be detached from the nozzle and outflow aperture when incubation is complete. This method is described by Ballermann B. J. et al. Int. Application No. WO 94 25584 and in U.S. application Ser. No. 08 430 768 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In general two three dimensional frameworks can be combined into a tube in accordance with the invention using any of the following methods.

Two or more flat frameworks can be laid atop another and sutured together. This two layer sheet can then be rolled up and as described above joined together and secured.

One tubular scaffold that is to serve as the inner layer can be inoculated with PPDCs or PPDC products and incubated. A second scaffold can be grown as a flat strip with width slightly larger than the outer circumference of the tubular framework. After appropriate growth is attained the flat framework can be wrapped around the outside of the tubular scaffold followed by closure of the seam of the two edges of the flat framework and preferably securing the flat framework to the inner tube.

Two or more tubular meshes of slightly differing diameters can be grown separately. The framework with the smaller diameter can be inserted inside the larger one and secured.

For each of these methods more layers can be added by reapplying the method to the double layered tube. The scaffolds can be combined at any stage of growth of the PPDCs and incubation of the combined scaffolds can be continued when desirable. Scaffolds comprising PPDC products may be layered with scaffolds comprising PPDCs.

The lumenal aspect of the tubular construct can be comprised of or treated with materials that render the lumenal surface of the tubular scaffold non thrombogenic. These treatments and materials may also promote and sustain endothelial growth migration and extracellular matrix deposition. Examples of these materials and treatments include but are not limited to natural materials such as basement membrane proteins such as laminin and Type IV collagen synthetic materials such as ePTFE and segmented polyurethaneurea silicones such as PURSPAN The Polymer Technology Group Inc. Berkeley Calif. . These materials can be further treated to render the lumenal surface of the tubular scaffold non thrombogenic. Such treatments include anti thrombotic agents such as heparin and treatments which alter the surface charge of the material such as plasma coating.

Advanced bioreactors may be necessary to meet the complex requirements of in vitro engineering of functional skeletal tissues. Bioreactor systems with the ability to apply complex concurrent mechanical strains to three dimensional matrices for example in conjunction with enhanced environmental and fluidic control are provided by Altman et al. 124 6 742 749 2002 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002 0062151. For example but not by way of limitation such a bioreactor system may be used in the development of a tissue engineered tendon or ligament e.g. anterior cruciate ligament.

According to the present invention any suitable method can be employed to shape the three dimensional culture to assume the conformation of the natural organ or tissue to be simulated. For example a framework prepared in accordance with the invention may be trimmed to a pre selected size for surgical repair of the damaged tissue. Trimming may be performed with the use of a sharp cutting implement i.e. a scalpel a pair of scissors or an arthroscopic device fitted with a cutting edge using procedures well known in the art.

The three dimensional frameworks can be shaped to assume a conformation which simulates the shape of a natural organ or tissue such as soft tissue including but not limited to pelvic floor bladder fascia skin muscle tendon ligament or vasculature e.g. arteries veins . These constructions simulate biological structures in vivo and may be readily implanted to repair hernias or to replace damaged or diseased tissues including hernias tendons ligaments skin muscle blood vessels and components of the gastrointestinal tract genitourinary tract e.g. urethra ureter .

In some embodiments PPDCs or PPDC products are seeded on the scaffold in combination e.g. as a co culture or as separate layers of cells with stem cells and or cells of a soft tissue phenotype. The cells to be co inoculated with the PPDCs will depend upon the tissue to be simulated. For example PPDCs may be inoculated onto the scaffold with epithelial cells e.g. cells of oral mucosa gastrointestinal tract nasal epithelium respiratory tract epithelium vaginal epithelium corneal epithelium bone marrow cells adipocytes stem cells keratinocytes vascular endothelial cells e.g. aortic endothelial cells coronary artery endothelial cells pulmonary artery endothelial cells iliac artery endothelial cells microvascular endothelial cells umbilical artery endothelial cells umbilical vein endothelial cells and endothelial progenitors e.g. CD34 CD34 CD117 cells bladder urothelial cells smooth muscle cells gastrointestinal cells esophageal cells larynx cells mucosal cells myoblasts myocytes stromal cells and other soft tissue cells or progenitor cells.

The three dimensional scaffold of the invention may be used in skin grafting. Preferably the scaffold is about 0.5 to 3 millimeter thick and is in the form of a flat sheet. The scaffold is preferably seeded with PPDCs or PPDC products. The scaffolds may be co inoculated with at least one of stem cells epithelial cells dermal fibroblasts melanocytes and keratinocytes. In some embodiments keratinocytes form a layer over the PPDC seeded framework. The scaffolds of the invention preferably comprise at least one of collagen elastin intercellular adhesion molecules neural cell adhesion molecules laminin heparin binding growth factor fibronectin proteoglycan tenascin E cahedrin and fibrillin.

As another example the three dimensional scaffold may be used to generate muscle tissue. The scaffold is preferably seeded with PPDCs or PPDC products. The scaffolds may be co inoculated with at least one of stem cells myocytes and myoblasts.

The three dimensional framework may be modified so that the growth of cells and the production of tissue thereon or therein is enhanced or so that the risk of rejection of the implant is reduced. Thus one or more biologically active compounds including but not limited to antiapoptotic agents anti inflammatories angiogenic factors immunosuppressants or growth factors may be added to the framework.

As an alternative to implanting the cells of the invention or tissue produced therefrom a subject in need of tissue repair replacement or augmentation may benefit from the administration of a PPDC product such as extracellular matrix ECM conditioned medium or a cell fraction of PPDCs.

In some embodiments coculture of PPDCs with a scaffold deposits ECM onto the framework. Once ECM is secreted onto the framework the cells may be removed. The ECM may be processed for further use for example as an injectable preparation. Scaffolds comprising the ECM may be used therapeutically. Alternatively ECM may be collected from the scaffold. The collection of the ECM can be accomplished in a variety of ways depending for example on whether the scaffold is biodegradable or non biodegradable. For example if the framework is non biodegradable the ECM can be removed by subjecting the framework to sonication high pressure water jets mechanical scraping or mild treatment with detergents or enzymes or any combination of the above.

If the framework is biodegradable the ECM can be collected for example by allowing the framework to degrade or dissolve in solution. Alternatively if the biodegradable framework is composed of a material that can itself be injected along with the ECM the framework and the ECM product can be processed in toto for subsequent injection. Alternatively the ECM can be removed from the biodegradable framework by any of the methods described above for collection of ECM from a non biodegradable framework. All collection processes are preferably designed so as not to denature the ECM produced by the cells of the invention.

Once the ECM has been collected it may be processed further. The ECM can be homogenized to fine particles using techniques well known in the art such as for example by sonication so that they can pass through a surgical needle. ECM components can be crosslinked if desired by gamma irradiation. Preferably the ECM can be irradiated between 0.25 to 2 mega rads to sterilize and crosslink the ECM. Chemical crosslinking using agents that are toxic such as glutaraldehyde is possible but not generally preferred.

Cell fractions prepared from the populations of the postpartum derived cells also have many utilities. In one embodiment whole cell lysates are prepared e.g. by disrupting cells without subsequent separation of cell fractions. In another embodiment a cell membrane fraction is separated from a soluble fraction of the cells by routine methods known in the art e.g. centrifugation filtration or similar methods. Use of soluble cell fractions or supernatants in vivo allows the beneficial intracellular milieu to be used in a patient without triggering rejection or an adverse response. Methods of lysing cells are well known in the art and include various means of freeze thaw disruption osmotic disruption mechanical disruption ultrasonic disruption enzymatic disruption e.g. hyaluronidase dispase proteases and nucleases for example deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease or chemical disruption non ionic detergents such as for example alkylaryl polyether alcohol TRITON X 100 octylphenoxy polyethoxyethanol Rohm and Haas Philadelphia Pa. BRIJ 35 a polyethoxyethanol lauryl ether Atlas Chemical Co. San Diego Calif. polysorbate 20 TWEEN 20 a polyethoxyethanol sorbitan monolaureate Rohm and Haas polyethylene lauryl ether Rohm and Haas and ionic detergents such as for example sodium dodecyl sulphate sulfated higher aliphatic alcohols sulfonated alkanes and sulfonated alkylarenes containing 7 to 22 carbon atoms in a branched or unbranched chain or combinations thereof. Such cell lysates may be prepared from cells directly in their growth medium and thus containing secreted growth factors and the like or may be prepared from cells washed free of medium in for example PBS or other solution. Cells may also be lysed on their growth substrate. Washed cells may be resuspended at concentrations greater than the original population density if preferred. Cell lysates prepared from populations of postpartum derived cells may be used as is further concentrated by for example ultrafiltration or lyophilization or even dried partially purified combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents as are known in the art or combined with other compounds such as biologicals for example pharmaceutically useful protein compositions. In some embodiments cellular membranes are removed from the lysate for example by centrifugation or ultracentrifugation filtration chromatograph or sedimentation to yield a membrane fraction and supernate fraction. The membrane fraction or the supernate may be used according to the methods of the invention. In some embodiments cellular debris is removed by treatment with a mild detergent rinse such as EDTA CHAPS or a zwitterionic detergent. Cell lysates may be used in vitro or in vivo alone or for example with cells or on a substrate. The cell lysates if introduced in vivo may be introduced locally at a site of treatment or remotely to provide for example needed cellular growth factors to a patient.

The amounts and or ratios of proteins may be adjusted by mixing the PPDC product of the invention with cells or with ECM or cell fraction of one or more other cell types. In addition biologically active substances such as proteins growth factors and or drugs can be incorporated into the PPDC product formulation. Exemplary biologically active substances include anti inflammatory agents and growth factors which promote healing and tissue repair. Cells may be co administered with the PPDC products of the invention.

The above described process for preparing PPDC products is preferably carried out under sterile conditions using sterile materials. The processed PPDC product in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be injected intradermally intraarticularly or subcutaneously to augment tissue or to repair or correct congenital anomalies acquired defects or cosmetic defects.

Examples of such conditions are congenital anomalies such as hemifacial microsomia malar and zygomatic hypoplasia unilateral mammary hypoplasia pectus excavatum pectoralis agenesis Poland s anomaly and velopharyngeal incompetence secondary to cleft palate repair or submucous cleft palate as a retropharyngeal implant acquired defects post traumatic post surgical post infectious such as scars subcutaneous atrophy e.g. secondary to discoid lupus erythematosus keratotic lesions acne pitting of the face linear scleroderma with subcutaneous atrophy saddle nose deformity Romberg s disease and unilateral vocal cord paralysis cosmetic defects such as glabellar frown lines deep nasolabial creases circum oral geographical wrinkles sunken cheeks and mammary hypoplasia hernias tears or ruptures of a tendon or ligament severe burns skin ulcers e.g. decubitus pressure ulcers venous ulcers and diabetic ulcers and surgical wounds such as those associated with the excision of skin cancers vascular diseases such as peripheral arterial disease abdominal aortic aneurysm carotid disease and venous disease muscle diseases e.g. congenital myopathies myasthenia gravis inflammatory neurogenic and myogenic muscle diseases and muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy Becker muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy limb girdle muscular dystrophy facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy congenital muscular dystrophies oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy distal muscular dystrophy and Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and replacement and repair of connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments.

The cells and tissues of the invention may be used in vitro to screen for effectiveness as a trophic support or for cytotoxicity of compounds including pharmaceutical agents growth regulatory factors and anti inflammatory agents. To this end the cells of the invention are maintained in vitro and exposed to the compound to be tested. The activity of a cytotoxic compound can be measured by its ability to damage or kill cells in culture. This may readily be assessed by vital staining techniques. The effect of trophic factors may be assessed by analyzing the number of living cells in vitro e.g. by total cell counts and differential cell counts or by detecting a marker of differentiation. This may be accomplished using standard cytological and or histological techniques including the use of immunocytochemical techniques employing antibodies that define type specific cellular antigens. The effect of various drugs on the cells of the invention either in suspension culture or in the three dimensional system described above may be assessed.

The cells and tissues of the invention may be used as model systems for the study of soft tissue conditions.

The cells and tissues of the invention may also be used to study the mechanism of action of cytokines growth factors and inflammatory mediators e.g. IL 1 TNF and prostaglandins. In addition cytotoxic and or pharmaceutical agents can be screened for those that are most efficacious for a particular patient. Agents that prove to be efficacious in vitro could then be used to treat the patient therapeutically.

In a further embodiment the cells of the invention can be cultured in vitro to produce biological products in high yield. For example such cells which either naturally produce a particular biological product of interest e.g. a growth factor regulatory factor or peptide hormone or have been genetically engineered to produce a biological product could be clonally expanded using for example the three dimensional culture system described above. If the cells excrete the biological product into the nutrient medium the product can be readily isolated from the spent or conditioned medium using standard separation techniques e.g. such as differential protein precipitation ion exchange chromatography gel filtration chromatography electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography. A bioreactor may be used to take advantage of the flow method for feeding for example a three dimensional culture in vitro.

Essentially as fresh media is passed through the three dimensional culture the biological product is washed out of the culture and may then be isolated from the outflow as above.

Alternatively a biological product of interest may remain within the cell and thus its collection may require that the cells are lysed. The biological product may then be purified using any one or more of the above listed techniques.

The PPDCs and PPDC products can conveniently be employed as part of a kit for example for culture or in vivo administration. Accordingly the invention provides a kit including the PPDCs and or PPDC products and additional components such as a matrix e.g. a scaffold hydrating agents e.g. physiologically compatible saline solutions prepared cell culture media cell culture substrates e.g. culture dishes plates vials etc. cell culture media whether in liquid or powdered form antibiotic compounds hormones a bioactive factor a second cell type a differentiation inducing agent cell culture media and the like. While the kit can include any such components preferably it includes all ingredients necessary for its intended use. If desired the kit also can include cells typically cryopreserved which can be seeded into the lattice as described herein.

In another aspect the invention provides kits that utilize the PPDCs PPDC populations products of PPDCs in various methods for augmentation regeneration and repair as described above. In some embodiments the kits may include one or more cell populations including at least PPDCs and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier liquid semi solid or solid . The kits also optionally may include a means of administering the cells for example by injection. The kits further may include instructions for use of the cells. Kits prepared for field hospital use such as for military use may include full procedure supplies including tissue scaffolds surgical sutures and the like where the cells are to be used in conjunction with repair of acute injuries. Kits for assays and in vitro methods as described herein may contain one or more of 1 PPDCs or products of PPDCs 2 reagents for practicing the in vitro method 3 other cells or cell populations as appropriate and 4 instructions for conducting the in vitro method.

PPDCs of the invention can be cryopreserved and maintained or stored in a cell bank . Cryopreservation of cells of the invention may be carried out according to known methods. For example but not by way of limitation cells may be suspended in a freeze medium such as for example culture medium further comprising 0 to 95 percent FBS and 0 to 10 percent dimethylsulfoxide DMSO with or without 5 to 10 percent glycerol at a density for example of about 0.5 to 10 10cells per milliliter. The cryopreservation medium may comprise cryopreservation agents including but not limited to methylcellulose. The cells are dispensed into glass or plastic ampoules that are then sealed and transferred to the freezing chamber of a controlled rate freezer. The optimal rate of freezing may be determined empirically. A programmable rate freezer for example can give a change in temperature of 1 to 10 C. per minute. The preferred cryopreservation temperature is about 80 C. to about 180 C. more preferably is about 90 C. to about 160 C. and most preferably is about 125 to about 140 C. Cryopreserved cells preferably are transferred to liquid nitrogen prior to thawing for use. In some embodiments for example once the ampoules have reached about 90 C. they are transferred to a liquid nitrogen storage area. Cryopreserved cells can be stored for a period of years. Alternatively cells could be freeze dried using agents such as but not limited to trehalose sucrose maltose and sorbitol.

The cryopreserved cells of the invention constitute a bank of cells portions of which can be withdrawn by thawing and then used as needed. Thawing should generally be carried out rapidly for example by transferring an ampoule from liquid nitrogen to a 37 C. water bath. The thawed contents of the ampoule should be immediately transferred under sterile conditions to a culture vessel containing an appropriate medium such as DMEM conditioned with 10 percent FBS.

In another aspect the invention provides for banking of tissues cells PPDC derivatives and cell populations in freeze dried form. A trehalose pre incubation step is necessary to achieve this. In addition to trehalose sucrose or other additives might be used. This will allow the generation of room temperature stable products with long shelf lives.

The following examples describe several aspects of embodiments of the invention in greater detail. These examples are provided to further illustrate not to limit aspects of the invention described herein.

The objective of this study was to derive populations of cells from placental and umbilicus tissues. Postpartum umbilicus and placenta were obtained upon birth of either a full term or pre term pregnancy. Cells were harvested from 5 separate donors of umbilicus and placental tissue. Different methods of cell isolation were tested for their ability to yield cells with 1 the potential to differentiate into cells with different phenotypes or 2 the potential to provide critical trophic factors useful for other cells and tissues.

Umbilical cords were obtained from National Disease Research Interchange NDRI Philadelphia Pa. . The tissues were obtained following normal deliveries. The cell isolation protocol was performed aseptically in a laminar flow hood. To remove blood and debris the umbilicus was washed in phosphate buffered saline PBS Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. in the presence of antimycotic and antibiotic 100 Units milliliter penicillin 100 micrograms milliliter streptomycin 0.25 micrograms milliliter amphotericin B Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . The tissues were then mechanically dissociated in 150 cmtissue culture plates in the presence of 50 milliliters of medium DMEM Low glucose or DMEM High glucose Invitrogen until the tissue was minced into a fine pulp. The chopped tissues were transferred to 50 milliliter conical tubes approximately 5 grams of tissue per tube . The tissue was then digested in either DMEM Low glucose medium or DMEM High glucose medium each containing antimycotic and antibiotic 100 Units milliliter penicillin 100 micrograms milliliter streptomycin 0.25 micrograms milliliter amphotericin B Invitrogen and digestion enzymes. In some experiments an enzyme mixture of collagenase and dispase was used C D collagenase Sigma St Louis Mo. 500 Units milliliter and dispase Invitrogen 50 Units milliliter in DMEM Low glucose medium . In other experiments a mixture of collagenase dispase and hyaluronidase C D H was used collagenase 500 Units milliliter dispase 50 Units milliliter and hyaluronidase Sigma 5 Units milliliter in DMEM Low glucose . The conical tubes containing the tissue medium and digestion enzymes were incubated at 37 C. in an orbital shaker Environ Brooklyn N.Y. at 225 rpm for 2 hrs.

After digestion the tissues were centrifuged at 150 g for 5 minutes and the supernatant was aspirated. The pellet was resuspended in 20 milliliters of Growth medium DMEM Low glucose Invitrogen 15 percent v v fetal bovine serum FBS defined bovine serum Lot AND18475 Hyclone Logan Utah 0.001 v v 2 mercaptoethanol Sigma 100 Units milliliter of penicillin 100 microgram milliliter streptomycin 0.25 microgram milliliter amphotericin B Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . The cell suspension was filtered through a 70 micrometer nylon cell strainer BD Biosciences . An additional 5 milliliter rinse comprising Growth medium was passed through the strainer. The cell suspension was then passed through a 40 micrometer nylon cell strainer BD Biosciences and chased with a rinse of an additional 5 milliliters of Growth medium.

The filtrate was resuspended in Growth medium total volume 50 milliliters and centrifuged at 150 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and the cells were resuspended in 50 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. This process was repeated twice more.

Upon the final centrifugation supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. The number of viable cells was determined using Trypan Blue staining. Cells were then cultured under standard conditions.

Corning N.Y. in Growth medium DMEM Low glucose Invitrogen 15 percent v v defined bovine serum Hyclone Logan Utah Lot AND18475 0.001 percent v v 2 mercaptoethanol Sigma 100 Units milliliter penicillin 100 micrograms milliliter streptomycin 0.25 micrograms milliliter amphotericin B Invitrogen . After about 2 4 days spent medium was aspirated from the flasks. Cells were washed with PBS three times to remove debris and blood derived cells. Cells were then replenished with Growth medium and allowed to grow to confluence about 10 days from passage 0 to passage 1 . On subsequent passages from passage 1 to 2 etc. cells reached sub confluence 75 85 percent confluence in 4 5 days. For these subsequent passages cells were seeded at 5000 cells cm. Cells were grown in a humidified incubator with 5 percent carbon dioxide and 20 percent oxygen at 37 C.

Placental tissue was obtained from NDRI Philadelphia Pa. . The tissues were from a pregnancy and were obtained at the time of a normal surgical delivery. Placental cells were isolated as described for umbilicus cell isolation.

The following example applies to the isolation of separate populations of maternal derived and neonatal derived cells from placental tissue.

The cell isolation protocol was performed aseptically in a laminar flow hood. The placental tissue was washed in phosphate buffered saline PBS Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. in the presence of antimycotic and antibiotic 100 Units milliliter penicillin 100 microgram milliliter streptomycin 0.25 microgram milliliter amphotericin B Invitrogen to remove blood and debris. The placental tissue was then dissected into three sections top line neonatal side or aspect mid line mixed cell isolation neonatal and maternal or villous region and bottom line maternal side or aspect .

The separated sections were individually washed several times in PBS with antibiotic antimycotic to further remove blood and debris. Each section was then mechanically dissociated in 150 cmtissue culture plates in the presence of 50 milliliters of DMEM Low glucose Invitrogen to a fine pulp. The pulp was transferred to 50 milliliter conical tubes. Each tube contained approximately 5 grams of tissue. The tissue was digested in either DMEM Low glucose or DMEM High glucose medium containing antimycotic and antibiotic 100 Units milliliter penicillin 100 micrograms milliliter streptomycin 0.25 micrograms milliliter amphotericin B Invitrogen of PBS and digestion enzymes. In some experiments an enzyme mixture of collagenase and dispase C D was used containing collagenase Sigma St Louis Mo. at 500 Units milliliter and dispase Invitrogen at 50 Units milliliter in DMEM Low glucose medium. In other experiments a mixture of collagenase dispase and hyaluronidase C D H was used collagenase 500 Units milliliter dispase 50 Units milliliter and hyaluronidase Sigma 5 Units milliliter in DMEM Low glucose . The conical tubes containing the tissue medium and digestion enzymes were incubated for 2 h at 37 C. in an orbital shaker Environ Brooklyn N.Y. at 225 rpm.

After digestion the tissues were centrifuged at 150 g for 5 minutes the resultant supernatant was aspirated off. The pellet was resuspended in 20 milliliter of Growth medium DMEM Low glucose Invitrogen 15 v v fetal bovine serum FBS defined bovine serum Lot AND18475 Hyclone Logan Utah 0.001 v v 2 mercaptoethanol Sigma St. Louis Mo. antibiotic antimycotic 100 Units milliliter penicillin 100 microgram milliliter streptomycin 0.25 microgram milliliter amphotericin B Invitrogen . The cell suspension was filtered through a 70 micrometer nylon cell strainer BD Biosciences chased by a rinse with an additional 5 milliliters of Growth medium. The total cell suspension was passed through a 40 micrometer nylon cell strainer BD Biosciences followed with an additional 5 milliliters of Growth medium as a rinse.

The filtrate was resuspended in Growth medium total volume 50 milliliters and centrifuged at 150 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. This process was repeated twice more. After the final centrifugation supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. A cell count was determined using the Trypan Blue Exclusion test. Cells were then cultured at standard conditions.

Cells were isolated from umbilicus in DMEM Low glucose medium with LIBERASE Boehringer Mannheim Corp. Indianapolis Ind. 2.5 milligrams per milliliter Blendzyme 3 Roche Applied Sciences Indianapolis Ind. and hyaluronidase 5 Units milliliter Sigma . Digestion of the tissue and isolation of the cells was as described for other protease digestions above using a LIBERASE Boehringer Mannheim Corp. Indianapolis Ind. hyaluronidase mixture in place of the C D or C D H enzyme mixture. Tissue digestion with LIBERASE Boehringer Mannheim Corp. Indianapolis Ind. resulted in the isolation of cell populations from postpartum tissues that expanded readily.

Procedures were compared for isolating cells from the umbilicus using differing enzyme combinations. Enzymes compared for digestion included i collagenase ii dispase iii hyaluronidase iv collagenase dispase mixture C D v collagenase hyaluronidase mixture C H vi dispase hyaluronidase mixture D H and vii collagenase dispase hyaluronidase mixture C D H . Differences in cell isolation utilizing these different enzyme digestion conditions were observed Table 1 1 .

Attempts were made to isolate pools of cells from umbilicus by different approaches. In one instance umbilical cord was sliced and washed with Growth medium to dislodge the blood clots and gelatinous material. The mixture of blood gelatinous material and Growth medium was collected and centrifuged at 150 g. The pellet was resuspended and seeded onto gelatin coated flasks in Growth medium. From these experiments a cell population was isolated that readily expanded.

Cells have also been isolated from cord blood samples attained from NDRI. The isolation protocol used here was that of International Patent Application PCT US2002 029971 by Ho et al. Samples 50 milliliters and 10.5 milliliters respectively of umbilical cord blood NDRI Philadelphia Pa. were mixed with lysis buffer filter sterilized 155 millimolar ammonium chloride 10 millimolar potassium bicarbonate 0.1 millimolar EDTA buffered to pH 7.2 all components from Sigma St. Louis Mo. . Cells were lysed at a ratio of 1 20 cord blood to lysis buffer. The resulting cell suspension was vortexed for 5 seconds and incubated for 2 minutes at ambient temperature. The lysate was centrifuged 10 minutes at 200 g . The cell pellet was resuspended in complete minimal essential medium Gibco Carlsbad Calif. containing 10 percent fetal bovine serum Hyclone Logan Utah 4 millimolar glutamine Mediatech Herndon Va. 100 Units penicillin per 100 milliliters and 100 micrograms streptomycin per 100 milliliters Gibco Carlsbad Calif. . The resuspended cells were centrifuged 10 minutes at 200 g the supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was washed in complete medium. Cells were seeded directly into either T75 flasks Corning N.Y. T75 laminin coated flasks or T175 fibronectin coated flasks both Becton Dickinson Bedford Mass. .

To determine whether cell populations can be isolated under different conditions and expanded under a variety of conditions immediately after isolation cells were digested in Growth medium with or without 0.001 percent v v 2 mercaptoethanol Sigma St. Louis Mo. using the enzyme combination of C D H according to the procedures provided above. Placenta derived cells so isolated were seeded under a variety of conditions. All cells were grown in the presence of penicillin streptomycin. Table 1 2 .

In all conditions cells attached and expanded well between passage 0 and 1 Table 1 2 . Cells in conditions 5 to 8 and 13 to 16 were demonstrated to proliferate well up to 4 passages after seeding at which point they were cryopreserved. All cells were banked.

The combination of C D H provided the best cell yield following isolation and generated cells which expanded for many more generations in culture than the other conditions Table 1 1 . An expandable cell population was not attained using collagenase or hyaluronidase alone. No attempt was made to determine if this result is specific to the collagen that was tested.

Cells attached and expanded well between passage 0 and 1 under all conditions tested for enzyme digestion and growth Table 1 2 . Cells in experimental conditions 5 8 and 13 16 proliferated well up to 4 passages after seeding at which point they were cryopreserved. All cells were banked.

Nucleated cells attached and grew rapidly. These cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and were similar to cells obtained by enzyme digestion.

The preparations contained red blood cells and platelets. No nucleated cells attached and divided during the first 3 weeks. The medium was changed 3 weeks after seeding and no cells were observed to attach and grow.

Populations of cells can be isolated from umbilical cord and placental tissue most efficiently using the enzyme combination collagenase a matrix metalloprotease dispase neutral protease and hyaluronidase a mucolytic enzyme which breaks down hyaluronic acid . LIBERASE Boehringer Mannheim Corp. Indianapolis Ind. which is a Blendzyme may also be used. In the present study Blendzyme 3 which is collagenase 4 Wunsch units g and thermolysin 1714 casein Units g was also used together with hyaluronidase to isolate cells. These cells expand readily over many passages when cultured in Growth medium on gelatin coated plastic.

Postpartum derived cells were isolated from residual blood in the cords but not from cord blood. The presence of cells in blood clots washed from the tissue that adhere and grow under the conditions used may be due to cells being released during the dissection process.

Several cell culture media were evaluated for their ability to support the growth of placenta derived cells. The growth of placenta derived cells in normal 20 and low 5 oxygen was assessed after 3 days using the MTS calorimetric assay.

Placenta derived cells at passage 8 P8 were seeded at 1 10cells well in 96 well plates in Growth medium DMEM low glucose Gibco Carlsbad Calif. 15 v v fetal bovine serum Cat. SH30070.03 Hyclone Logan Utah 0.001 v v betamercaptoethanol Sigma St. Louis Mo. 50 Units milliliter penicillin 50 micrograms milliliter streptomycin Gibco . After 8 hours the medium was changed as described in Table 2 1 and cells were incubated in normal 20 v v or low 5 v v oxygen at 37 C. 5 COfor 48 hours. MTS was added to the culture medium CELLTITER 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay Promega Madison Wis. for 3 hours and the absorbance measured at 490 nanometers Molecular Devices Sunnyvale Calif. .

Standard curves for the MTS assay established a linear correlation between an increase in absorbance and an increase in cell number. The absorbance values obtained were converted into estimated cell numbers and the change relative to the initial seeding was calculated.

The addition of serum to media at normal oxygen conditions resulted in a reproducible dose dependent increase in absorbance and thus the viable cell number. The addition of serum to complete MSCGM resulted in a dose dependent decrease in absorbance. In the media without added serum cells grew in Cellgro Ham s F10 and DMEM.

In decreasing order of growth the media resulting in the best growth of the cells were Growth medium MSCGM Iscove s 10 FBS DMEM HG 10 FBS Ham s F12 10 FBS RPMI 1640 10 FBS.

Postpartum derived cells may be grown in a variety of culture media in normal or low oxygen. Short term growth of placenta derived cells was determined in 12 basal media with 0 2 and 10 v v serum in 5 or 20 O. In general placenta derived cells did not grow in serum free conditions with the exceptions of Ham s F10 and Cellgro free which are also protein free. Growth in these serum free media was approximately 25 33 of the maximal growth observed with Growth medium containing 15 serum. This study demonstrates that placenta derived cells may be grown in serum free conditions and that Growth medium is one of several media 10 serum in Iscove s RPMI or Ham s F12 media that can be used to grow placenta derived cells.

The most promising serum free media was CELLGRO FREE a serum and protein free medium without hormones or growth factors which is designed for the growth of mammalian cells in vitro Mediatech product information .

Complete serum free medium also developed for serum free culture was not as effective in supporting growth of the placenta derived cells. Complete serum free was developed by Mediatech based on a 50 50 mix of DMEM F12 with smaller percentages of RPMI 1640 and McCoy s 5A. This medium also contains selected trace elements and high molecular weight carbohydrates extra vitamins a non animal protein source and a small amount of BSA 1 gram liter . It does not contain any insulin transferrin cholesterol or growth or attachment factors. It is bicarbonate buffered for use with 5 CO. Originally designed for hybridomas and suspension cell lines it may be suitable for some anchorage dependent cell lines.

It has been reported that medium containing D valine instead of the normal L valine isoform can be used to selectively inhibit the growth of fibroblast like cells in culture Hongpaisan 2000 Sordillo et al. 1988 . The growth of postpartum derived cells in medium containing D valine in the absence of L valine was evaluated.

Placenta derived cells P3 fibroblasts P9 and umbilicus derived cells P5 were seeded at 5 10cells cmin gelatin coated T75 flasks Corning Corning N.Y. . After 24 hours the medium was removed and the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS Gibco Carlsbad Calif. to remove residual medium. The medium was replaced with a Modified Growth medium DMEM with D valine special order Gibco 15 v v dialyzed fetal bovine serum Hyclone Logan Utah 0.001 v v betamercaptoethanol Sigma 50 Units milliliter penicillin 50 micrograms milliliter streptomycin Gibco .

Placenta derived umbilicus derived and fibroblast cells seeded in the D valine containing medium did not proliferate unlike cells seeded in Growth medium containing dialyzed serum. Fibroblasts changed morphologically increasing in size and changing shape. All of the cells died and eventually detached from the flask surface after 4 weeks.

Postpartum derived cells require L valine for cell growth and for long term viability. L valine is preferably not removed from the growth medium for postpartum derived cells.

The objective of this study was to determine a suitable cryopreservation medium for the cryopreservation of postpartum derived cells.

Placenta derived cells grown in Growth medium DMEM low glucose Gibco Carlsbad Calif. 15 v v fetal bovine serum Cat. SH30070.03 Hyclone Logan Utah 0.001 v v betamercaptoethanol Sigma St. Louis Mo. 50 Units milliliter penicillin 50 microgram milliliter streptomycin Gibco in a gelatin coated T75 flask were washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS Gibco and trypsinized using 1 milliliter Trypsin EDTA Gibco . The trypsinization was stopped by adding 10 milliliters Growth medium. The cells were centrifuged at 150 g supernatant removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 milliliter Growth medium. An aliquot of cell suspension 60 microliter was removed and added to 60 microliter trypan blue Sigma . The viable cell number was estimated using a hemocytometer. The cell suspension was divided into four equal aliquots each containing 88 10cells each. The cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in 1 milliliter of each media below and transferred into Cryovials Nalgene .

The cells were cooled at approximately 1 C. min overnight in a 80 C. freezer using a Mr Frosty freezing container according to the manufacturer s instructions Nalgene Rochester N.Y. . Vials of cells were transferred into liquid nitrogen for 2 days before thawing rapidly in a 37 C. water bath. The cells were added to 10 milliliters Growth medium and centrifuged before the cell number and viability was estimated as before. Cells were seeded onto gelatin coated flasks at 5 000 cells cmto determine whether the cells would attach and proliferate.

The initial viability of the cells to be cryopreserved was assessed by trypan blue staining to be 100 .

There was a commensurate reduction in cell number with viability for C6295 due to cells lysis. The viable cells cryopreserved in all four solutions attached divided and produced a confluent monolayer within 3 days. There was no discernable difference in estimated growth rate.

The cryopreservation of cells is one procedure available for preparation of a cell bank or a cell product. Four cryopreservation mixtures were compared for their ability to protect human placenta derived cells from freezing damage. Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM and 10 v v dimethylsulfoxide DMSO is the preferred medium of those compared for cryopreservation of placenta derived cells.

The cell expansion potential of postpartum derived cells was compared to other populations of isolated stem cells. The art of cell expansion to senescence is referred to as Hayflick s limit Hayflick L. The longevity of cultured human cells. 22 1 1 12 1974 Hayflick L. The strategy of senescence. 14 1 37 45 1974 . Postpartum derived cells are highly suited for therapeutic use because they can be readily expanded to sufficient cell numbers.

Tissue culture plastic flasks were coated by adding 20 milliliters 2 w v porcine gelatin Type B 225 Bloom Sigma St Louis Mo. to a T75 flask Corning Corning N.Y. for 20 minutes at room temperature. After removing the gelatin solution 10 milliliters phosphate buffered saline PBS Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. were added and then aspirated.

For comparison of growth expansion potential the following cell populations were utilized i Mesenchymal stem cells MSC Cambrex Walkersville Md. ii Adipose derived cells U.S. Pat. No. 6 555 374 B1 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2004 0058412 iii Normal dermal skin fibroblasts cc 2509 lot 9F0844 Cambrex Walkersville Md. iv Umbilicus derived cells and v Placenta derived cells. Cells were initially seeded at 5 000 cells cmon gelatin coated T75 flasks in DMEM Low glucose growth medium Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. with 15 v v defined bovine serum Hyclone Logan Utah Lot AND18475 0.001 v v 2 mercaptoethanol Sigma St. Louis Mo. 100 Units milliliter penicillin 100 micrograms milliliter streptomycin 0.25 micrograms milliliter amphotericin B Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . For subsequent passages cell cultures were treated as follows. After trypsinization viable cells were counted after Trypan Blue staining. Cell suspension 50 microliters was combined with Trypan Blue 50 microliters Sigma St. Louis Mo. . Viable cell numbers were estimated using a hemocytometer.

Following counting cells were seeded at 5 000 cells cmonto gelatin coated T 75 flasks in 25 milliliters of fresh Growth medium. Cells were grown under standard atmosphere with 5 carbon dioxide at 37 C. The growth medium was changed twice per week. When cells reached about 85 percent confluence they were passaged this process was repeated until the cells reached senescence.

At each passage cells were trypsinized and counted. The viable cell yield population doubling In cell final cell initial ln 2 and doubling time time in culture h population doubling were calculated. For the purposes of determining optimal cell expansion the total cell yield per passage was determined by multiplying the total yield for the previous passage by the expansion factor for each passage i.e. expansion factor cell final cell initial .

The expansion potential of cells banked at passage 10 was also tested. A different set of conditions was used. Normal dermal skin fibroblasts cc 2509 lot 9F0844 Cambrex Walkersville Md. umbilicus derived cells and placenta derived cells were tested. These cell populations had been banked at passage 10 previously having been seeded at 5 000 cells cmand grown to confluence at each passage to that point. The effect of cell density on the cell populations following cell thaw at passage 10 was determined. Cells were thawed under standard conditions counted using Trypan Blue staining. Thawed cells were then seeded at 1 000 cells cmin Growth medium DMEM Low glucose Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. with 15 percent v v defined bovine serum Hyclone Logan Utah Lot AND18475 0.001 percent 2 mercaptoethanol Sigma St. Louis Mo. 100 Units milliliter penicillin 100 micrograms milliliter streptomycin 0.25 micrograms milliliter amphotericin B Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. . Cells were grown under standard atmospheric conditions at 37 C. Growth medium was changed twice a week and cells were passaged as they reached about 85 confluence. Cells were subsequently passaged until senescence i.e. until they could not be expanded any further. Cells were trypsinized and counted at each passage. The cell yield population doubling ln cell final cell initial ln 2 and doubling time time in culture h population doubling were calculated. The total cell yield per passage was determined by multiplying total yield for the previous passage by the expansion factor for each passage i.e. expansion factor cell final cell initial .

The expansion potential of freshly isolated postpartum derived cell cultures under low cell seeding conditions was tested in another experiment. Umbilicus and placenta derived cells were isolated as described herein. Cells were seeded at 1000 cells cmand passaged as described above until senescence. Cells were grown under standard atmospheric conditions at 37 C. Growth medium was changed twice per week. Cells were passaged as they reached about 85 confluence. At each passage cells were trypsinized and counted by Trypan Blue staining. The cell yield population doubling ln cell final cell initial ln 2 and doubling time time in culture h population doubling were calculated for each passage. The total cell yield per passage was determined by multiplying the total yield for the previous passage by the expansion factor for each passage i.e. expansion factor cell final cell initial . Cells were grown on gelatin and non gelatin coated flasks.

Cloning may be used in order to expand a population of neonatal or maternal cells successfully from placental tissue. Following isolation of three different cell populations from the placenta neonatal aspect maternal aspect and villous region these cell populations are expanded under standard growth conditions and then karyotyped to reveal the identity of the isolated cell populations. By isolating the cells from a mother who delivers a boy it is possible to distinguish between the male and female chromosomes by performing metaphase spreads. These experiments can be used to demonstrate that top line cells are karyotype positive for neonatal phenotype mid line cells are karyotype positive for both neonatal and maternal phenotypes and bottom line cells are karyotype positive for maternal cells.

It has been demonstrated that low Ocell culture conditions can improve cell expansion in certain circumstances Csete et al. Low oxygen culturing of central nervous system progenitor cells. US2004 0005704 . In order to determine if cell expansion of postpartum derived cells could be improved by altering cell culture conditions cultures of umbilicus derived cells were grown in low oxygen conditions. Cells were seeded at 5 000 cells cmin Growth medium on gelatin coated flasks. Cells were initially cultured under standard atmospheric conditions through passage 5 at which point they were transferred to low oxygen 5 O culture conditions.

In other experiments postpartum derived cells were expanded on non coated collagen coated fibronectin coated laminin coated and extracellular membrane protein e.g. MATRIGEL BD Discovery Labware Bedford Mass. coated plates. Cultures have been demonstrated to expand well on each.

Comparison of Expansion Potential of Postpartum Derived Cells vs. Other Stem Cell and Non Stem Cell Populations.

Both umbilicus derived and placenta derived cells expanded for greater than 40 passages generating cell yields of 1E17 cells in 60 days. In contrast MSCs and fibroblasts senesced after 

Umbilicus derived placenta derived and fibroblast cells expanded for greater than 10 passages generating cell yields of 1E11 cells in 60 days Table 5 2 . After 60 days under these conditions the fibroblasts became senescent whereas the umbilicus derived and placenta derived cell populations senesced after 80 days completing 50 and 40 population doublings respectively.

Postpartum derived cells were seeded at low density 1 000 cells cm on gelatin coated and uncoated plates or flasks. Growth potential of these cells under these conditions was good. The cells expanded readily in a log phase growth. The rate of cell expansion was similar to that observed when postpartum derived cells were seeded at 5 000 cells cmon gelatin coated flasks in Growth medium. No differences were observed in cell expansion potential between culturing on either uncoated flasks or gelatin coated flasks. However cells appeared phenotypically much smaller on gelatin coated flasks and more larger cell phenotypes were observed on uncoated flasks.

A clonal neonatal or maternal cell population can be expanded from placenta derived cells isolated from the neonatal aspect or the maternal aspect respectively of the placenta. Cells are serially diluted and then seeded onto gelatin coated plates in Growth medium for expansion at 1 cell well in 96 well gelatin coated plates. From this initial cloning expansive clones are identified trypsinized and reseeded in 12 well gelatin coated plates in Growth medium and then subsequently passaged into T25 gelatin coated flasks at 5 000 cells cmin Growth medium. Subcloning is performed to ensure that a clonal population of cells has been identified. For subcloning experiments cells are trypsinized and reseeded at 0.5 cells well. The subclones that grow well are expanded in gelatin coated T25 flasks at 5 000 cells cm flask. Cells are passaged at 5 000 cells cm T75 flask. The growth characteristics of a clone may be plotted to demonstrate cell expansion. Karyotyping analysis can confirm that the clone is either neonatal or maternal.

Postpartum derived cells expanded well under the reduced oxygen conditions. Culturing under low oxygen conditions does not appear to have a significant effect on cell expansion for postpartum derived cells. Standard atmospheric conditions have already proven successful for growing sufficient numbers of cells and low oxygen culture is not required for the growth of postpartum derived cells.

Commercially viable cell products must be able to be produced in sufficient quantities to provide therapeutic treatment to patients in need of the treatment. Postpartum derived cells can be expanded in culture for such purposes. Comparisons were made of the growth of postpartum derived cells in culture to that of other cell populations including mesenchymal stem cells. The data demonstrated that postpartum derived cell lines as developed herein can expand for greater than 40 doublings to provide sufficient cell numbers for example for pre clinical banks. Furthermore these postpartum derived cell populations can be expanded well at low or high density. This study has demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells in contrast cannot be expanded to obtain large quantities of cells.

The current cell expansion conditions of growing isolated postpartum derived cells at densities of about 5 000 cells cmin Growth medium on gelatin coated or uncoated flasks under standard atmospheric oxygen are sufficient to generate large numbers of cells at passage 11. Furthermore the data suggests that the cells can be readily expanded using lower density culture conditions e.g. 1 000 cells cm . Postpartum derived cell expansion in low oxygen conditions also facilitates cell expansion although no incremental improvement in cell expansion potential has yet been observed when utilizing these conditions for growth. Presently culturing postpartum derived cells under standard atmospheric conditions is preferred for generating large pools of cells. However when the culture conditions are altered postpartum derived cell expansion can likewise be altered. This strategy may be used to enhance the proliferative and differentiative capacity of these cell populations.

Under the conditions utilized while the expansion potential of MSC and adipose derived cells is limited postpartum derived cells expand readily to large numbers.

Cell lines used in cell therapy are preferably homogeneous and free from any contaminating cell type. Human cells used in cell therapy should have a normal chromosome number 46 and structure. To identify postpartum derived placental and umbilicus cell lines that are homogeneous and free from cells of non postpartum tissue origin karyotypes of cell samples were analyzed.

PPDCs from postpartum tissue of a male neonate were cultured in Growth medium DMEM low glucose Gibco Carlsbad Calif. 15 v v fetal bovine serum FBS Hyclone Logan Utah 0.001 v v betamercaptoethanol Sigma St. Louis Mo. and 50 Units milliliter penicillin 50 micrograms milliliter streptomycin Gibco Carlsbad Calif. . Postpartum tissue from a male neonate X Y was selected to allow distinction between neonatal derived cells and maternal derived cells X X . Cells were seeded at 5 000 cells per square centimeter in Growth medium in a T25 flask Corning Corning N.Y. and expanded to about 80 confluence. A T25 flask containing cells was filled to the neck with Growth medium. Samples were delivered to a clinical cytogenetics lab by courier estimated lab to lab transport time is one hour . Chromosome analysis was performed by the Center for Human Molecular Genetics at the New Jersey Medical School Newark N.J. Cells were analyzed during metaphase when the chromosomes are best visualized. Of twenty cells in metaphase counted five were analyzed for normal homogeneous karyotype number two . A cell sample was characterized as homogeneous if two karyotypes were observed. A cell sample was characterized as heterogeneous if more than two karyotypes were observed. Additional metaphase cells were counted and analyzed when a heterogeneous karyotype number four was identified.

All cell samples sent for chromosome analysis were interpreted by the cytogenetics laboratory staff as exhibiting a normal appearance. Three of the sixteen cell lines analyzed exhibited a heterogeneous phenotype XX and XY indicating the presence of cells derived from both neonatal and maternal origins Table 6 1 . Cells derived from tissue Placenta N were isolated from the neonatal aspect of placenta. At passage zero this cell line appeared homogeneous XY. However at passage nine the cell line was heterogeneous XX XY indicating a previously undetected presence of cells of maternal origin.

Chromosome analysis identified placenta and umbilicus derived PPDCs whose karyotypes appear normal as interpreted by a clinical cytogenetic laboratory. Karyotype analysis also identified cell lines free from maternal cells as determined by homogeneous karyotype.

Characterization of cell surface proteins or markers by flow cytometry can be used to determine a cell line s identity. The consistency of expression can be determined from multiple donors and in cells exposed to different processing and culturing conditions. Postpartum derived cell lines isolated from the placenta and umbilicus were characterized by flow cytometry thereby providing a profile for the identification of the cells of the invention.

Cells were cultured in DMEM low glucose Growth medium Gibco Carlsbad Calif. with 15 v v fetal bovine serum FBS Hyclone Logan Utah 0.001 v v betamercaptoethanol Sigma St. Louis Mo. and 50 Units milliliter penicillin 50 micrograms milliliter streptomycin Gibco Carlsbad Calif. .

Cells were cultured in plasma treated T75 T150 and T225 tissue culture flasks Corning Corning N.Y. until confluent. The growth surfaces of the flasks were coated with gelatin by incubating 2 w v gelatin Sigma St. Louis Mo. for 20 minutes at room temperature.

Adherent cells in flasks were washed in phosphate buffered saline PBS Gibco Carlsbad Calif. and detached with Trypsin EDTA Gibco Carlsbad Calif. . Cells were harvested centrifuged and resuspended in 3 v v FBS in PBS at a cell concentration of 1 10per milliliter. In accordance with the manufacturer s specifications antibody to the cell surface marker of interest Table 7 1 was added to one hundred microliters of cell suspension and the mixture was incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 4 C. After incubation cells were washed with PBS and centrifuged to remove unbound antibody. Cells were resuspended in 500 microliters PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a FACScalibur instrument Becton Dickinson San Jose Calif. .

To compare differences among donors placenta derived cells from different donors were compared to each other and umbilicus derived cells from different donors were compared to each other.

Placenta derived cells cultured on gelatin coated flasks were compared to placenta derived cells cultured on uncoated flasks. Umbilicus derived cells cultured on gelatin coated flasks were compared to umbilicus derived cells cultured on uncoated flasks.

Four treatments used for isolation and preparation of cells were compared. Cells derived from postpartum tissue by treatment with 1 collagenase 2 collagenase dispase 3 collagenase hyaluronidase and 4 collagenase hyaluronidase dispase were compared.

Cells isolated from the maternal aspect of placental tissue were compared to cells isolated from the villous region of placental tissue and cells isolated from the neonatal fetal aspect of placenta.

Placenta and umbilicus derived cells analyzed by flow cytometry showed positive for production of CD10 CD13 CD44 CD73 CD90 PDGFr alpha and HLA A B C indicated by the increased values of fluorescence relative to the IgG control. These cells were negative for detectable production of CD31 CD34 CD45 CD117 CD141 and HLA DR DP DQ indicated by fluorescence values comparable to the IgG control. Variations in fluorescence values of positive curves was accounted. The mean i.e. CD13 and range i.e. CD90 of the positive curves showed some variation but the curves appeared normal confirming a homogeneous population. Both curves individually exhibited values greater than the IgG control.

Placenta derived cells at passages 8 15 and 20 analyzed by flow cytometry all were positive for production of CD10 CD13 CD44 CD73 CD90 PDGFr alpha and HLA A B C as reflected in the increased value of fluorescence relative to the IgG control. The cells were negative for production of CD31 CD34 CD45 CD117 CD141 and HLA DR DP DQ having fluorescence values consistent with the IgG control.

Umbilicus derived cells at passage 8 15 and 20 analyzed by flow cytometry all expressed CD10 CD13 CD44 CD73 CD90 PDGFr alpha and HLA A B C indicated by increased fluorescence relative to the IgG control.

The marrow was mixed with lysis buffer 155 micromolar NHCl 10 micromolar KHCO and 0.1 micromolar EDTA pH 7.2 at a ratio of 1 part bone marrow to 20 parts lysis buffer. The cell suspension was vortexed incubated for 2 minutes at ambient temperature and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 500 g. The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in Minimal Essential Medium alpha Invitrogen supplemented with 10 v v fetal bovine serum and 4 micromolar glutamine. The cells were centrifuged again and the cell pellet was resuspended in fresh medium. The viable mononuclear cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion Sigma St. Louis Mo. .

The biotin labeled cRNA was hybridized with HG U133A August 2003 Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays Affymetrix Santa Clara Calif. . The hybridization and data collection was performed according to the manufacturer s specifications.

Fourteen different populations of cells were analyzed in this study. The cells along with passage information culture substrate and culture media are listed in Table 8 1.

The data were evaluated by a Principle Component Analysis analyzing the 290 genes that were differentially expressed in the cells. This analysis allows for a relative comparison for the similarities between the populations. Table 8 2 shows the Euclidean distances that were calculated for the comparison of the cell pairs. The Euclidean distances were based on the comparison of the cells based on the 290 genes that were differentially expressed among the cell types. The Euclidean distance is inversely proportional to similarity between the expression of the 290 genes.

The GENECHIP analysis was performed to provide a molecular characterization of the postpartum cells derived from umbilicus and placenta. This analysis included cells derived from three different umbilical cords and three different placentas. The study also included two different lines of dermal fibroblasts three lines of mesenchymal stem cells and three lines of iliac crest bone marrow cells. The mRNA that was expressed by these cells was analyzed by AffyMetrix GENECHIP that contained oligonucleotide probes for 22 000 genes.

Results showed that 290 genes are differentially expressed in these five different cell types. These genes include ten genes that are specifically increased in the placenta derived cells and seven genes specifically increased in the umbilicus derived cells. Fifty four genes were found to have specifically lower expression levels in placenta and umbilical cord.

The expression of selected genes has been confirmed by PCR in Example 9. These results demonstrate that the postpartum derived cells have a distinct gene expression profile for example as compared to bone marrow derived cells and fibroblasts.

Results of real time PCR for selected signature genes performed on cDNA from cells derived from human placentas adult and neonatal fibroblasts and Mesenchymal Stem Cells MSCs indicate that both oxidized LDL receptor and renin were expressed at higher level in the placenta derived cells as compared to other cells. The data obtained from real time PCR were analyzed by the CT method and expressed on a logarithmic scale. Levels of reticulon and oxidized LDL receptor expression were higher in umbilicus derived cells as compared to other cells. No significant difference in the expression levels of CXC ligand 3 and GCP 2 were found between postpartum derived cells and controls data not shown . CXC ligand 3 was expressed at very low levels. GCP 2 was expressed at levels comparable to human adult and neonatal fibroblasts. The results of real time PCR were confirmed by conventional PCR. Sequencing of PCR products further validated these observations. No significant difference in the expression level of CXC ligand 3 was found between postpartum derived cells and controls using conventional PCR CXC ligand 3 primers listed in Table 9 1.

The expression of the cytokine IL 8 in postpartum derived cells is elevated in both Growth medium cultured and serum starved postpartum derived cells. All real time PCR data was validated with conventional PCR and by sequencing PCR products.

When supernatants of cells grown in serum free medium were examined for the presence of IL 8 the highest amounts were detected in media derived from umbilicus derived cells and some isolates of placenta derived cells Table 9 2 . No IL 8 was detected in medium derived from human dermal fibroblasts.

Placenta derived cells were also examined for the expression of oxidized LDL receptor GCP 2 and GROalpha by FACS analysis. Cells tested positive for GCP 2. Oxidized LDL receptor and GRO were not detected by this method.

Placenta derived cells were also tested for the expression of selected proteins by immunocytochemical analysis. Immediately after isolation passage 0 cells derived from the human placenta were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde and exposed to antibodies for six proteins von Willebrand Factor CD34 cytokeratin 18 desmin alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Cells stained positive for both alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin. This pattern was preserved through passage 11. Only a few cells 

Cells derived from the human umbilical cord at passage 0 were probed for the expression of selected proteins by immunocytochemical analysis. Immediately after isolation passage 0 cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde and exposed to antibodies for six proteins von Willebrand Factor CD34 cytokeratin 18 desmin alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin. Umbilicus derived cells were positive for alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin with the staining pattern consistent through passage 11.

Placenta derived cells at passage 11 were also investigated by immunocytochemistry for the expression of GROalpha and GCP 2. Placenta derived cells were GCP 2 positive but GROalpha expression was not detected by this method.

The expression of GROalpha GCP 2 oxidized LDL receptor 1 and reticulon NOGO A in umbilicus derived cells at passage 11 was investigated by immunocytochemistry. Umbilicus derived cells were GCP 2 positive but GRO alpha expression was not detected by this method. Furthermore cells were NOGO A positive.

Accordance between gene expression levels measured by microarray and PCR both real time and conventional has been established for four genes oxidized LDL receptor 1 renin reticulon and IL 8. The expression of these genes was differentially regulated at the mRNA level in postpartum derived cells with IL 8 also differentially regulated at the protein level. The presence of oxidized LDL receptor was not detected at the protein level by FACS analysis in cells derived from the placenta. Differential expression of GCP 2 and CXC ligand 3 was not confirmed at the mRNA level however GCP 2 was detected at the protein level by FACS analysis in the placenta derived cells. Although this result does not support data originally obtained from the microarray experiment this may be due to a difference in the sensitivity of the methodologies.

Immediately after isolation passage 0 cells derived from the human placenta stained positive for both alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin. This pattern was also observed in cells at passage 11. These results suggest that vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin expression may be preserved in cells with passaging at least in the Growth medium used here.

Cells derived from the human umbilicus at passage 0 were probed for the expression of alpha smooth muscle actin and vimentin and were positive for both. The staining pattern was preserved through passage 11.

In conclusion the complete mRNA data at least partially verifies the data obtained from the microarray experiments.

The phenotypes of cells found within human postpartum tissues namely umbilical cord and placenta were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.

Human umbilical cord and placental tissue were harvested and immersion fixed in 4 w v paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 C. Immunohistochemistry was performed using antibodies directed against the following epitopes see Table 10 1 vimentin 1 500 Sigma St. Louis Mo. desmin 1 150 raised against rabbit Sigma or 1 300 raised against mouse Chemicon Temecula Calif. alpha smooth muscle actin SMA 1 400 Sigma cytokeratin 18 CK18 1 400 Sigma von Willebrand Factor vWF 1 200 Sigma and CD34 human CD34 Class III 1 100 DAKOCytomation Carpinteria Calif. . In addition the following markers were tested anti human GROalpha PE 1 100 Becton Dickinson Franklin Lakes N.J. anti human GCP 2 1 100 Santa Cruz Biotech Santa Cruz Calif. anti human oxidized LDL receptor 1 ox LDL R1 1 100 Santa Cruz Biotech and anti human NOGO A 1 100 Santa Cruz Biotech . Fixed specimens were trimmed with a scalpel and placed within OCT embedding compound Tissue Tek OCT Sakura Torrance Calif. on a dry ice bath containing ethanol. Frozen blocks were then sectioned 10 micron thick using a standard cryostat Leica Microsystems and mounted onto glass slides for staining.

Immunohistochemistry was performed similar to previous studies e.g. Messina et al. 2003 184 816 829 . Tissue sections were washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS and exposed to a protein blocking solution containing PBS 4 v v goat serum Chemicon Temecula Calif. and 0.3 v v Triton Triton X 100 Sigma for 1 hour to access intracellular antigens. In instances where the epitope of interest would be located on the cell surface CD34 ox LDL R1 triton was omitted in all steps of the procedure in order to prevent epitope loss. Furthermore in instances where the primary antibody was raised against goat GCP 2 ox LDL R1 NOGO A 3 v v donkey serum was used in place of goat serum throughout the procedure. Primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution were then applied to the sections for a period of 4 hours at room temperature. Primary antibody solutions were removed and cultures washed with PBS prior to application of secondary antibody solutions 1 hour at room temperature containing block along with goat anti mouse IgG Texas Red 1 250 Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. and or goat anti rabbit IgG Alexa 488 1 250 Molecular Probes or donkey anti goat IgG FITC 1 150 Santa Cruz Biotech . Cultures were washed and 10 micromolar DAPI Molecular Probes was applied for 10 minutes to visualize cell nuclei.

Following immunostaining fluorescence was visualized using the appropriate fluorescence filter on an Olympus inverted epi fluorescent microscope Olympus Melville N.Y. . Positive staining was represented by fluorescence signal above control staining. Representative images were captured using a digital color videocamera and ImagePro software Media Cybernetics Carlsbad Calif. . For triple stained samples each image was taken using only one emission filter at a time. Layered montages were then prepared using Adobe Photoshop software Adobe San Jose Calif. .

Vimentin desmin SMA CK18 vWF and CD34 markers were expressed in a subset of the cells found within umbilical cord data not shown . In particular vWF and CD34 expression were restricted to blood vessels contained within the cord. CD34 cells were on the innermost layer lumen side . Vimentin expression was found throughout the matrix and blood vessels of the cord. SMA was limited to the matrix and outer walls of the artery and vein but was not contained within the vessels themselves. CK18 and desmin were observed within the vessels only desmin being restricted to the middle and outer layers.

Vimentin desmin alpha smooth muscle actin cytokeratin 18 von Willebrand Factor and CD 34 are expressed in cells within human umbilical cord and placenta. Based on in vitro characterization studies showing that only vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin are expressed the data suggests that the current process of postpartum cell isolation harvests a subpopulation of cells or that the cells isolated change expression of markers to express vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin.

Postpartum derived cell lines were evaluated in vitro for their immunological characteristics in an effort to predict the immunological response if any these cells would elicit upon in vivo transplantation. Postpartum derived cell lines were assayed by flow cytometry for the expression of HLA DR HLA DP HLA DQ CD80 CD86 and B7 H2. These proteins are expressed by antigen presenting cells APC and are required for the direct stimulation of na ve CD4 T cells Abbas Lichtman CMI5th Ed. 2003 Saunders Philadelphia p. 171 . The cell lines were also analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of HLA G Abbas Lichtman CMI5th Ed. 2003 Saunders Philadelphia p. 171 CD 178 Coumans et. al. 1999 224 185 196 and PD L2 Abbas Lichtman CMI5th Ed. 2003 Saunders Philadelphia p. 171 Brown et. al. 2003 170 1257 1266 . The expression of these proteins by cells residing in placental tissues is thought to mediate the immuno privileged status of placental tissues in utero. To predict the extent to which postpartum placenta and umbilicus derived cell lines elicit an immune response in vivo the cell lines were tested in a one way mixed lymphocyte reaction MLR .

Cryopreserved vials of passage 10 umbilicus derived PPDCs labeled as cell line A and passage 11 placenta derived PPDCs labeled as cell line B were sent on dry ice to CTBR Senneville Quebec to conduct a mixed lymphocyte reaction using CTBR SOP no. CAC 031. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs were collected from multiple male and female volunteer donors. Stimulator donor allogeneic PBMC autologous PBMC and postpartum derived cell lines were treated with mitomycin C. Autologous and mitomycin C treated stimulator cells were added to responder recipient PBMCs and cultured for 4 days. After incubation H thymidine was added to each sample and cultured for 18 hours. Following harvest of the cells radiolabeled DNA was extracted and H thymidine incorporation was measured using a scintillation counter.

The stimulation index for the allogeneic donor SIAD was calculated as the mean proliferation of the receiver plus mitomycin C treated allogeneic donor divided by the baseline proliferation of the receiver. The stimulation index of the postpartum derived cells was calculated as the mean proliferation of the receiver plus mitomycin C treated postpartum derived cell line divided by the baseline proliferation of the receiver.

Seven human volunteer blood donors were screened to identify a single allogeneic donor that would exhibit a robust proliferation response in a mixed lymphocyte reaction with the other six blood donors. This donor was selected as the allogeneic positive control donor. The remaining six blood donors were selected as recipients. The allogeneic positive control donor and placenta derived cell lines were treated with mitomycin C and cultured in a mixed lymphocyte reaction with the six individual allogeneic receivers. Reactions were performed in triplicate using two cell culture plates with three receivers per plate Table 11 2 . The average stimulation index ranged from 1.3 plate 2 to 3 plate 1 and the allogeneic donor positive controls ranged from 46.25 plate 2 to 279 plate 1 Table 11 3 .

Histograms of placenta derived cells analyzed by flow cytometry show negative expression of HLA DR DP DQ CD80 CD86 and B7 H2 as noted by fluorescence value consistent with the IgG control indicating that placenta derived cell lines lack the cell surface molecules required to directly stimulate allogeneic PBMCs e.g. CD4 T cells .

Histograms of placenta derived cells analyzed by flow cytometry show positive expression of PD L2 as noted by the increased value of fluorescence relative to the IgG control and negative expression of CD178 and HLA G as noted by fluorescence value consistent with the IgG control data not shown .

Histograms of umbilicus derived cells analyzed by flow cytometry show negative expression of HLA DR DP DQ CD80 CD86 and B7 H2 as noted by fluorescence value consistent with the IgG control indicating that umbilicus derived cell lines lack the cell surface molecules required to directly stimulate allogeneic PBMCs e.g. CD4 T cells .

Histograms of umbilicus derived cells analyzed by flow cytometry show positive expression of PD L2 as noted by the increased value of fluorescence relative to the IgG control and negative expression of CD178 and HLA G as noted by fluorescence value consistent with the IgG control.

In the mixed lymphocyte reactions conducted with placenta derived cell lines the average stimulation index ranged from 1.3 to 3 and that of the allogeneic positive controls ranged from 46.25 to 279. In the mixed lymphocyte reactions conducted with umbilicus derived cell lines the average stimulation index ranged from 6.5 to 9 and that of the allogeneic positive controls ranged from 42.75 to 70. Placenta and umbilicus derived cell lines were negative for the expression of the stimulating proteins HLA DR HLA DP HLA DQ CD80 CD86 and B7 H2 as measured by flow cytometry. Placenta and umbilicus derived cell lines were negative for the expression of immuno modulating proteins HLA G and CD178 and positive for the expression of PD L2 as measured by flow cytometry. Allogeneic donor PBMCs contain antigen presenting cells expressing HLA DP DR DQ CD80 CD86 and B7 H2 thereby allowing for the stimulation of allogeneic PBMCs e.g. na ve CD4 T cells . The absence of antigen presenting cell surface molecules on placenta and umbilicus derived cells required for the direct stimulation of allogeneic PBMCs e.g. na ve CD4 T cells and the presence of PD L2 an immuno modulating protein may account for the low stimulation index exhibited by these cells in a MLR as compared to allogeneic controls.

The secretion of selected trophic factors from placenta and umbilicus derived PPDCs was measured. Factors were selected that have angiogenic activity i.e. hepatocyte growth factor HGF Rosen et al. 1997 212 215 26 monocyte chemotactic protein 1 MCP 1 Salcedo et al. 2000 96 34 40 interleukin 8 IL 8 Li et al. 2003 170 3369 76 keratinocyte growth factor KGF basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF Hughes et al. 2004 77 812 8 tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 TIMP1 angiopoietin 2 ANG2 platelet derived growth factor PDGF bb thrombopoietin TPO heparin binding epidermal growth factor HB EGF stromal derived factor 1a SDF 1a neurotrophic neuroprotective activity brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF Cheng et al. 2003 258 319 33 interleukin 6 IL 6 granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 GCP 2 transforming growth factor beta2 TGFbeta2 or chemokine activity macrophage inflammatory protein 1a MIP1a macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta MIP1b monocyte chemoattractant 1 MCP 1 Rantes regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted I309 thymus and activation regulated chemokine TARC Eotaxin macrophage derived chemokine MDC IL 8 .

PPDCs derived from placenta and umbilicus as well as human fibroblasts derived from human neonatal foreskin were cultured in Growth medium DMEM low glucose Gibco Carlsbad Calif. 15 v v fetal bovine serum SH30070.03 Hyclone Logan Utah 50 Units milliliter penicillin 50 micrograms milliliter streptomycin Gibco on gelatin coated T75 flasks. Cells were cryopreserved at passage 11 and stored in liquid nitrogen. After thawing of the cells Growth medium was added to the cells followed by transfer to a 15 milliliter centrifuge tube and centrifugation of the cells at 150 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 milliliters Growth medium and cells were counted. Cells were seeded at 5 000 cells cmon a T75 flask containing 15 milliliters of Growth medium and cultured for 24 hours. The medium was changed to a serum free medium DMEM low glucose Gibco 0.1 w v bovine serum albumin Sigma 50 Units milliliter penicillin 50 micrograms milliliter streptomycin Gibco for 8 hours. Conditioned serum free media was collected at the end of incubation by centrifugation at 14 000 g for 5 minutes and stored at 80 C. To estimate the number of cells in each flask cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS and detached using 2 milliliters trypsin EDTA Gibco . Trypsin activity was inhibited by addition of 8 milliliters Growth medium. Cells were centrifuged at 150 g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and cells were resuspended in 1 milliliter Growth Medium. Cell number was estimated using a hemocytometer.

Cells were grown at 37 C. in 5 carbon dioxide and atmospheric oxygen. Placenta derived PPDCs 101503 also were grown in 5 oxygen or beta mercaptoethanol BME . The amount of MCP 1 IL 6 VEGF SDF 1a GCP 2 IL 8 and TGF beta2 produced by each cell sample was measured by an ELISA assay R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. . All assays were performed according to the manufacturer s instructions. Values presented are picogram milliliter million cells n 2 sem .

Chemokines MIP1a MIP1b MCP 1 Rantes I309 TARC Eotaxin MDC IL8 BDNF and angiogenic factors HGF KGF bFGF VEGF TIMP1 ANG2 PDGF bb TPO HB EGF were measured using SearchLight Proteome Arrays Pierce Biotechnology Inc. . The Proteome Arrays are multiplexed sandwich ELISAs for the quantitative measurement of two to 16 proteins per well. The arrays are produced by spotting a 2 2 3 3 or 4 4 pattern of four to 16 different capture antibodies into each well of a 96 well plate. Following a sandwich ELISA procedure the entire plate is imaged to capture chemiluminescent signal generated at each spot within each well of the plate. The amount of signal generated in each spot is proportional to the amount of target protein in the original standard or sample.

MCP 1 and IL 6 were secreted by placenta and umbilicus derived PPDCs and dermal fibroblasts Table 12 1 . Umbilicus derived cells secreted at least 10 fold higher amounts of MCP 1 and IL6 than other cell populations. GCP 2 and IL 8 were highly expressed by umbilicus derived PPDCs. TGF beta2 was not detectable. VEGF was detected in fibroblast medium.

The amount of HGF FGF and BDNF secreted from umbilicus derived cells were noticeably higher than fibroblasts and placenta derived cells Tables 12 2 and 12 3 . Similarly TIMP1 TPO HBEGF MCP 1 TARC and IL 8 were higher in umbilicus derived cells than other cell populations Table 12 3 . No ANG2 or PDGF bb were detected.

Umbilicus derived cells secreted significantly higher amount of trophic factors than placenta derived cells and fibroblasts. Some of these trophic factors such as HGF bFGF MCP 1 and IL 8 play important roles in angiogenesis. Other trophic factors such as BDNF and IL 6 have important roles in neural regeneration. Under these conditions the expression of some factors was confined to umbilicus derived cells such as MIP1b Rantes I309 and FGF.

Cell therapy may be injected systemically for certain applications where cells are able to target the site of action. It is important that injected cells not cause thrombosis which may be fatal. Tissue factor a membrane bound procoagulant glycoprotein is the initiator of the extrinsic clotting cascade which is the predominant coagulation pathway in vivo. Tissue factor also plays an important role in embryonic vessel formation for example in the formation of the primitive vascular wall Brodsky et al. 2002 10 299 306 . To determine the potential for PPDCs to initiate clotting umbilicus and placenta derived PPDCs were evaluated for tissue factor expression and their ability to initiate plasma clotting.

Human tissue factor SIMPLASTIN Organon Tekailca Corporation Durham N.C. was reconstituted with 20 milliliters distilled water. The stock solution was serially diluted 1 2 in eight tubes. Normal human plasma George King BioMedical Overland Park Kans. was thawed at 37 C. in a water bath and then stored in ice before use. To each well of a 96 well plate was added 100 microliters phosphate buffered saline PBS 10 microliters diluted Simplastin except a blank well 30 microliters 0.1 molar calcium chloride and 100 microliters of normal human plasma. The plate was immediately placed in a temperature controlled microplate reader and absorbance measured at 405 nanometers at 40 second intervals for 30 minutes.

J 82 cells ATCC MD were grown in Iscove s modified Dulbecco s medium IMDM Gibco Carlsbad Calif. containing 10 v v fetal bovine serum FBS Hyclone Logan Utah 1 millimolar sodium pyruvate Sigma Chemical St. Louis Mo. 2 millimolar L Glutamin Mediatech Herndon Va. 1 non essential amino acids Mediatech Herndon Va. . At 70 confluence cells were transferred to wells of a 96 well plate at 100 000 50 000 and 25 000 cells well. Postpartum derived cells derived from placenta and umbilicus were cultured in Growth Medium DMEM low glucose Gibco 15 v v FBS 50 Units milliliter penicillin 50 micrograms milliliter streptomycin Gibco and 0.001 betamercaptoethanol Sigma in gelatin coated T75 flasks Corning Corning N.Y. . Placenta derived cells at passage 5 and umbilicus derived cells at passages 5 and 11 were transferred to wells at 50 000 cells well. Culture medium was removed from each well after centrifugation at 150 g for 5 minutes. Cells were suspended in PBS without calcium and magnesium. Cells incubated with anti tissue factor antibody cells were incubated with 20 microgram milliliter CNTO 859 Centocor Malvern Pa. for 30 minutes. Calcium chloride 30 microliter was added to each well. The plate was immediately placed in a temperature controlled microplate reader and absorbance measured at 405 nanometers at 40 second intervals for 30 minutes.

Cells were washed in PBS and detached from the flask with Trypsin EDTA Gibco Carlsbad Calif. . Cells were harvested centrifuged and re suspended 3 v v FBS in PBS at a cell concentration of 1 10per milliliter. Antibody was added to 100 microliter cell suspension as per the manufacturer s specifications and the cells were incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 4 C. After incubation cells were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 150 g for 5 minutes to remove unbound antibody. Cells were re suspended in 100 microliter of 3 FBS and secondary antibody added as per the manufacturer s instructions. Cells were incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 4 C. After incubation cells were washed with PBS and centrifuged to remove unbound secondary antibody. Washed cells were re suspended in 500 microliters of PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Flow cytometry analysis was performed with a FACSCalibur instrument Becton Dickinson San Jose Calif. .

Flow cytometry analysis revealed that both placenta and umbilicus derived postpartum derived cells express tissue factor. A plasma clotting assay demonstrated that tissue factor was active. Both placenta and umbilicus derived cells increased the clotting rate as indicated by the time to half maximal absorbance T to max Table 13 1 . Clotting was observed with both early P5 and late P18 cells. The T to max is inversely proportional to the number of J82 cells. Preincubation of umbilical cells with CNTO 859 an antibody to tissue factor inhibited the clotting reaction thereby showing that tissue factor was responsible for the clotting.

Placenta and umbilicus derived PPDCs express tissue factor which can induce clotting. The addition of an antibody to tissue factor can inhibit tissue factor. Tissue factor is normally found on cells in a conformation that is inactive but is activated by mechanical or chemical e.g. LPS stress Sakariassen et al. 2001 104 149 74 Engstad et al. 2002 2 1585 97 . Thus minimization of stress during the preparation process of PPDCs may prevent activation of tissue factor. In addition to the thrombogenic activity tissue factor has been associated with angiogenic activity. Thus tissue factor activity may be beneficial when umbilicus or placenta derived PPDCs are transplanted in tissue but should be inhibited when PPDCs are injected intravenously.

Angiogenesis or the formation of new vasculature is necessary for the growth of new tissue. Induction of angiogenesis is an important therapeutic goal in many pathological conditions. The present study was aimed at identifying potential angiogenic activity of the postpartum derived cells in in vitro assays. The study followed a well established method of seeding endothelial cells onto a culture plate coated with MATRIGEL BD Discovery Labware Bedford Mass. a basement membrane extract Nicosia and Ottinetti 1990 26 2 119 28 . Treating endothelial cells on MATRIGEL BD Discovery Labware Bedford Mass. with angiogenic factors will stimulate the cells to form a network that is similar to capillaries. This is a common in vitro assay for testing stimulators and inhibitors of blood vessel formation Ito et al. 1996 67 1 148 52 . The present studies made use of a co culture system with the postpartum derived cells seeded onto culture well inserts. These permeable inserts allow for the passive exchange of media components between the endothelial and the postpartum derived cell culture media.

Human umbilical cords and placenta were received and cells were isolated as previously described Example 1 .

Briefly MATRIGEL BD Discovery Labware Bedford Mass. was thawed at 4 C. and approximately 250 microliters were aliquoted and distributed evenly onto each well of a chilled 24 well culture plate Corning . The plate was then incubated at 37 C. for 30 minutes to allow the material to solidify. Actively growing endothelial cell cultures were trypsinized and counted. Cells were washed twice in Growth medium with 2 FBS by centrifugation resuspension and aspiration of the supernatant. Cells were seeded onto the coated wells 20 000 cells per well in approximately 0.5 milliliter Growth medium with 2 v v FBS. Cells were then incubated for approximately 30 minutes to allow cells to settle.

Endothelial cell cultures were then treated with either 10 nanomolar human bFGF Peprotech Rocky Hill N.J. or 10 nanomolar human VEGF Peprotech Rocky Hill N.J. to serve as a positive control for endothelial cell response. Transwell inserts seeded with postpartum derived cells were added to appropriate wells with Growth medium with 2 FBS in the insert chamber. Cultures were incubated at 37 C. with 5 COfor approximately 24 hours. The well plate was removed from the incubator and images of the endothelial cell cultures were collected with an Olympus inverted microscope Olympus Melville N.Y. .

The results of the present study show that postpartum derived cells can stimulate both human umbilical vein and coronary artery endothelial cells to form networks in an in vitro MATRIGEL BD Discovery Labware Bedford Mass. assay. This effect is similar to that seen with known angiogenic factors in this assay system. These results suggest that the postpartum derived cells are useful for stimulating angiogenesis in vivo.

Cells derived from the postpartum umbilical cord and placenta are useful for regenerative therapies. The tissue produced by postpartum derived cells transplanted into SCID mice with a biodegradable material was evaluated. The materials evaluated were non woven comprised of poly lactic acid co glycolic acid polymer 10 90 PLGA 35 65 PCL PGA foam and RAD16 self assembling peptide hydrogel.

Placenta derived cells and umbilicus derived cells were grown in Growth medium DMEM low glucose Gibco Carlsbad Calif. 15 v v fetal bovine serum Cat. SH30070.03 Hyclone Logan Utah 0.001 v v betamercaptoethanol Sigma St. Louis Mo. 50 Units milliliter penicillin 50 microgram milliliter streptomycin Gibco in a gelatin coated flasks.

A nonwoven scaffold was prepared using a traditional needle punching technique as described below. Fibers comprised of a synthetic absorbable copolymer of glycolic and lactic acids 10 90 PLGA were obtained from Ethicon Inc. Somerville N.J. . The fibers were filaments of approximately 20 microns in diameter. The fibers were then cut and crimped into uniform 2 inch lengths to form 2 inch staple fiber. A dry lay needle punched nonwoven matrix VNW was then prepared utilizing the 10 90 PLGA staple fibers. The staple fibers were opened and carded on standard nonwoven machinery. The resulting mat was in the form of webbed staple fibers. The webbed staple fibers were needle punched to form the dry lay needle punched nonwoven scaffold. The nonwoven scaffold was rinsed in water followed by another incubation in ethanol to remove any residual chemicals or processing aids used during the manufacturing process.

Foams composed of 35 65 poly epsilon caprolactone poly glycolic acid 35 65 PCL PGA copolymer were formed by the process of lyophilization as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 355 699.

One million viable cells were seeded in 15 microliter Growth medium onto 5 millimeter diameter 2.25 millimeter thick VNW scaffolds 64.33 milligram cubic centimeters Lot 3547 47 1 or 5 millimeter diameter 35 65 PCL PGA foam Lot 3415 53 . Cells were allowed to attach for two hours before adding more Growth medium to cover the scaffolds. Cells were grown on scaffolds overnight. Scaffolds without cells were also incubated in medium.

The animals utilized in this study were handled and maintained in accordance with the current requirements of the Animal Welfare Act. Compliance with the above Public Laws were accomplished by adhering to the Animal Welfare regulations 9 CFR and conforming to the current standards promulgated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals 7th edition.

All handling of the SCID mice took place under a hood. The mice were individually weighed and anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of 60 milligram kilogram KETASET ketamine hydrochloride Aveco Co. Inc. Fort Dodge Iowa and 10 milligram kilogram ROMPUN xylazine Mobay Corp. Shawnee Kans. and saline. After induction of anesthesia the entire back of the animal from the dorsal cervical area to the dorsal lumbosacral area was clipped free of hair using electric animal clippers. The area was then scrubbed with chlorhexidine diacetate rinsed with alcohol dried and painted with an aqueous iodophor solution of 1 available iodine. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes to prevent drying of the tissue during the anesthetic period.

Four skin incisions each approximately 1.0 cm in length were made on the dorsum of the mice. Two cranial sites were located transversely over the dorsal lateral thoracic region about 5 mm caudal to the palpated inferior edge of the scapula with one to the left and one to the right of the vertebral column. Another two were placed transversely over the gluteal muscle area at the caudal sacro lumbar level about 5 mm caudal to the palpated iliac crest with one on either side of the midline. Implants were randomly placed in these sites. The skin was separated from the underlying connective tissue to make a small pocket and the implant placed or injected for RAD16 about 1 cm caudal to the incision. The appropriate test material was implanted into the subcutaneous space. The skin incision was closed with metal clips.

Mice were individually housed in microisolator cages throughout the course of the study within a temperature range of 64 F. 79 F. and relative humidity of 30 to 70 and maintained on an approximate 12 hour light 12 hour dark cycle. The temperature and relative humidity were maintained within the stated ranges to the greatest extent possible. Diet consisted of Irradiated Pico Mouse Chow 5058 Purina Co. and water fed ad libitum.

Mice were euthanized at their designated intervals by carbon dioxide inhalation. The subcutaneous implantation sites with their overlying skin were excised and frozen for histology.

Excised skin with implant was fixed with 10 neutral buffered formalin Richard Allan Kalamazoo Mich. . Samples with overlying and adjacent tissue were centrally bisected paraffin processed and embedded on cut surface using routine methods. Five micron tissue sections were obtained by microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin Poly Scientific Bay Shore N.Y. using routine methods.

There was minimal ingrowth of tissue into foams implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice after 30 days data not shown . In contrast there was extensive tissue fill in foams implanted with umbilicus derived cells or placenta derived cells data not shown .

There was some tissue in growth in VNW scaffolds. Non woven scaffolds seeded with umbilicus or placenta derived cells showed increased matrix deposition and mature blood vessels data not shown .

The purpose of this study was to determine the type of tissue formed by cells derived from human umbilicus or placenta in scaffolds in immune deficient mice. Synthetic absorbable non woven foam discs 5.0 millimeter diameter 1.0 millimeter thick or self assembling peptide hydrogel were seeded with either cells derived from human umbilical cord or placenta and implanted subcutaneously bilaterally in the dorsal spine region of SCID mice. The present study demonstrates that postpartum derived cells can dramatically increase good quality tissue formation in biodegradable scaffolds.

Approximately 25 million human umbilicus derived cells UDCs at passage 11 were seeded into gelatin coated T225 flasks. Because of the number of cells that were necessary to complete the study the flasks were split for trypsinization into two sets which were combined to prepare the cell lysate. The cells ranged from approximately 70 95 confluent. Flasks were trypsinized with 0.05 trypsin EDTA for 5 minutes until the cells began lifting from the dish. The trypsinization process was inactivated using 15 serum containing Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s growth media. Cells were pelleted in growth media and then resuspended in a total volume of 40 milliliters of PBS. The cells were washed three times in PBS to remove residual FBS from the growth media. This was done by centrifuging the cells for 5 minutes at 1.5 RPM and then resuspending the cells in 40 milliliters of PBS until the three washes were complete.

In order to facilitate the freeze thaw procedure the cells were equally divided into two tubes with PBS for the freeze thaw procedure. The lysates were prepared by repeated freeze thaw cycles. To freeze the cells the tubes were placed in a slurry of dry ice and isopropanol for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes the tubes were placed in a 37 C. water bath for 10 minutes.

The cell suspensions were transferred to ten sterile siliconized microcentrifuge tubes to prevent protein adsorption and centrifuged at 13 000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C. to separate the cell membranes from the cytosolic components. The tubes cell pellet were then placed on ice and the supernatant was very gently mixed by tapping the centrifuge tube to ensure uniformity. The supernatant was transferred to new siliconized tubes and placed on ice.

Chemokines BDNF and angiogenic factors were measured using SEARCHLIGHT Proteome Arrays Pierce Biotechnology Inc. . The proteome arrays are multiplexed sandwich ELISAs for the quantitative measurement of two to 16 proteins per well. The arrays are produced by spotting a 2 2 3 3 or 4 4 pattern of four to 16 different capture antibodies into each well of a 96 well plate. Following a typical sandwich ELISA procedure the entire plate is imaged to capture chemiluminescent signal generated at each spot within each well of the plate. The amount of signal generated in each spot is proportional to the amount of target protein in the original standard or sample.

UDC lysate contains significant levels of beneficial factors including pro angiogenic as well as factors that can stimulate cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production KGF PDGF BB HGF TGFa and neurotrophic factors BDNF IL 6 . These factors might have beneficial effects on local environment by inducing cell proliferation differentiation and survival. In addition pro angiogenic factors might induce new blood vessel formation in the wound environment and stimulate extracellular matrix formation. Furthermore the high level of TIMPs might be extremely beneficial in the chronic wound environment since chronic wounds are known to be associated with high levels of MMPs known to mediate extracellular matrix degradation.

Umbilicus derived cells produce and secrete various growth factors involved in tissue regeneration including basic Fibroblast Growth Factor bFGF hepatocyte growth factor HGF brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF and keratinocyte growth factor KGF . The supernatant of lysed umbilicus derived cells also contains these growth factors. The application of the lysate to biomaterials followed by lyophilization produces a device that upon clinical application will release the growth factors and enhance tissue regeneration.

The purpose of the present study was to provide methods for the production of lyophilized UDC lysate. The method consistently allowed the harvest of proteins from lysed UDCs. The amount of total protein 57.53 38.69 picograms per cell correlates to the harvest density of the cells R Sq adj 71.5 . The growth factor bFGF was present in six separate production lots of lyophilized UDC lysate averaging 3.09 1.06 picograms per microgram of total protein. SDS PAGE analysis of UDC lysate showed the banding pattern of protein was consistent between separate production lots pre and post lyophilization and lyophilization into a synthetic biomaterial. The current method allowed reproducible production of lyophilized material containing growth factors for application in tissue regeneration.

UDCs were seeded at 5 000 cells per cmin gelatin coated flasks with growth media Dulbecco s Modified Eagles Media DMEM low glucose 15 fetal bovine serum FBS penicillin streptomycin P S Betamercaptoethanol BME and expanded for 3 to 4 days 25 000 cells per cmtarget harvest density . Cells were harvested with trypsin collected and centrifuged at 300 rcf for 5 minutes. The trypsin media was removed by aspiration and cells were washed three times with phosphate buffered saline PBS .

After washing the cells were re suspended at 1.0E 07 cell ml in PBS and delivered as 1 ml aliquots into 1.5 ml sterile siliconized micro centrifuge tubes. The cells were centrifuged at 300 rcf for 5 minutes and the PBS was removed by aspiration. Tubes containing cell pellets were optionally stored at 80 C.

Tubes containing cell pellets were immersed in liquid nitrogen LN2 for 60 seconds. The tubes were then removed from LN2 and immediately immersed in a 37 C. water bath for 60 seconds or until thawed 3 minute maximum incubation time . This process was repeated two additional times.

The freeze thawed samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13 000 rcf at 4 C. and placed on ice. The supernatant fluid from each tube was removed by pipette and transferred to a single sterile siliconized 1.5 ml tube. This process was repeated until no additional supernatant fluid could be recovered.

To approximate supernatant fluid volume the 1.5 ml tube containing recovered supernatant fluid was weighed on a balance previously tared with an empty 1.5 ml micro centrifuge tube 1 milligram 1 microliter .

To determine total protein content 10 microliters of lysate supernatant fluid was diluted into 990 microliters PBS and the dilution was analyzed by Bradford assay standard range 1.25 25 micrograms . This value was used to calculate the total protein per cell the main metric used to ensure the consistency of the process.

Multiple 1.5 milliliter sterile labeled cryovials were loaded into a sterile heat transfer block. Aliquots of lysate supernatant fluid at defined total protein concentration were loaded into the cryovials. The heat block containing uncapped cryovials was aseptically loaded into an autoclaved pouch with tube openings facing the paper side of the pouch. The pouch was sealed before removal from the laminar flow hood. The pouch was loaded into the lyophilizer.

Pre cut materials i.e. 90 10 PGA PLA non woven were aseptically placed into the wells of 24 or 48 well sterile ultra low cluster cell culture dishes Corning Inc. Corning N.Y. . Lysate supernatant fluid was delivered at a defined total protein concentration onto the material. For example a material measuring 6 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness received 2 microliters of a 15 microgram microliter total protein solution to create a 30 microgram lysate protein material. The lid of the dish was replaced and secured with tape. The dish with materials was loaded into the lyophilizer

Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the following ramping program. All steps had a ramping rate of 2.5 C. minute and a 100 mT vacuum.

Vials from six separate production lots of lyophilized lysate powder were reconstituted in PBS and analyzed for total protein content by Bradford assay. The samples were then further diluted to achieve a 20 microgram milliliter solution. Solutions further serially diluted in PBS and analyzed by ELISA using a Quantikine human bFGF kit R D Systems cat. no. DFB50 .

The total protein content of recovered lysate supernatant fluid prior to lyophilization is a function of the cell density at time of harvest R Sq adj 71.5 .

Calculated concentration of bFGF per lyophilized UDC lysate total protein yielded the following equation bFGF picograms milliliter 28.745 total protein micrograms milliliter 25.656. Equation slope and Y intercept are derived from the average slope and Y intercept values obtained from regression analysis of six production lots.

Banding pattern of protein is consistent between separate production lots pre and post lyophilization and lyophilization onto a synthetic biomaterial.

The method presented here consistently allowed for the harvest of protein from lysed centrifuged UDCs. The amount of total protein 57.53 38.69 picograms per cell correlates to the harvest density of the cells R Sq adj 71.5 . The growth factor bFGF was present in six separate production lots of lyophilized UDC lysate averaging 3.09 1.06 picograms per micrograms of total protein. SDS PAGE analysis of umbilicus derived cell lysate showed that the banding pattern of protein was consistent between separate production lots pre and post lyophilization and following lyophilization onto a synthetic biomaterial. This method allows reproducible production of lyophilized material containing growth factors for application in tissue regeneration.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of human umbilicus cell derived cell lysate when delivered in a scaffold to induce cellular infiltration and tissue formation. Since this is a xenogeneic source of cells an early time point was chosen to evaluate the inflammatory response the cell lysate might exhibit. Two types of scaffolds VNW and 35 65 PCL PGA foam were tested to determine their potential to act as carriers for lysate delivery. As a nonlimiting example of the invention the cellular components of human umbilicus derived cells UDCs loaded on two different scaffold types were tested to evaluate the cell infiltration and inflammatory response elicited in a subcutaneous rat implantation study. UDC cellular lysate and cellular supernatant were prepared by different methods. In two of the methods the cell membranes remained in the preparation. In one method the cell membranes were removed. All treatments were lyophilized prior to implantation. This study included an n of 4 per treatment except controls which were matched on every animal n 28 .

Several trends surfaced upon analysis of the data. The amount of ingrowth into the foams was increased in the UDC supernatant and HF cell groups. The amount of ingrowth into the VNW differed the greatest in the UDC cells caudal as opposed to the VNW scaffold caudal . The cranial sites demonstrated near 100 ingrowth for all VNW treatment groups. In the cranial sites of the UDC supernatant there was increased cellularity of ingrowth fibroblasts and capillaries within the VNW scaffold as compared to the VNW alone. There appears to be an increase in the amount of collagen deposition within the VNW scaffold for the UDC lysate group caudal sites the UDC supernatant and HF groups cranial sites .

As expected the Growth medium control group did not increase cell ingrowth. The amount of ingrowth into the foam and VNW caudal sites was diminished.

Even though no statistical conclusions can be made from this study the data obtained suggest that the UDC supernatant preparation has a positive impact on cellular infiltration. The UDC supernatant group demonstrated increases in cellularity of ingrowth and collagen deposition in the VNW scaffold.

Four 4 sub cutaneous pockets 2 cranial 2 caudal were created on the dorsal region of 32 rats. The treatment groups were assigned to the sites and left in place throughout the study period. The treatments 6 mm punches were placed flat into the subcutaneous pocket. The implants were placed approximately 1 cm caudal to the incision. Metal wound clips were used to close the incision. Four animals were included in the study for only 3 days. These animals implanted with VNW scaffolds only were used to determine if there was an immediate immune reaction to the human cells in the rats. Tissues were harvested from the animals on days 3 and 14. The entire scaffold and surrounding skin was excised. The excised tissue was placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin for histological processing paraffin sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome. Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the percentage of ingrowth into the scaffold the quality of ingrowth into the scaffold the encapsulation of the scaffold and the inflammatory response within the scaffold.

The VNW was purchased from Biomedical Structures Slatersville R.I. . The scaffolds were placed in desiccant paper pillows that were then packaged in T vent aluminum pouches and sterilized via ethylene oxide sterilization nominal B cycle . The scaffolds were stored at room temperature prior to use. The following treatment groups were included in the study 

A 5 w w solution of 35 65 epsilon Caprolactone Glycolide molar composition of high purity grade 99 1 4 Dioxane Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh Pa. was prepared by dissolving five parts polymer to ninety five parts of solvent at 60 C. for 4 hours. The polymer solution was filtered through an extra coarse thimble prior to making the foam scaffolds. This polymer solution was diluted with dioxane to make a 3 w w solution. A pre determined amount of polymer solution was poured into a pre cooled aluminum mold and lyophilized to remove the solvent from the frozen structure by phase separation resulting in the interconnecting pore structure.

VNWs were scoured to remove residual processing oils. The material was scoured twice. The VNW was agitated in isopropanol IPA in the BRANSONIC Ultrasonic Cleaner BUC for at least 30 minutes. The IPA was drained and the VNW was washed with deionized water three times. The VNW was then agitated in deionized water in the BUC for an additional 30 minutes. The VNW was dried under vacuum overnight or until dry to the touch.

Approximately 30 million cells from each cell type UDC and HF were trypsinized and washed with PBS three times. Conceptually there are multiple ways in which a cell lysate could be prepared. Cells can be lysed by sonication freeze thaw or any number of other methods available to those skilled in the art. In this study three different methods of preparing a cell lysate fraction were examined. For this example the three preps will be referred to as cell lysate and supernatant . A cell suspension of 1 10 ml was prepared and divided into three groups. The cell groups UDC and HF were created from the original suspension. 100 microliters was added to each scaffold. The cell loaded scaffolds were placed in a shaker for 20 minutes to encourage incorporation of the cells into the scaffolds. The cell loaded scaffolds were then lyophilized in tissue culture plates prior to implantation in the rat.

The lysate groups were prepared by freezing and thawing cells for three cycles 80 C. for 10 min 37 C. and then 100 microliters was added to each scaffold. The lysate loaded scaffolds were placed in a shaker for 20 minutes to encourage incorporation of the lysate into the scaffolds. The lysate loaded scaffolds were then lyophilized in tissue culture plates prior to implantation in the rat.

The supernatant groups were prepared by freezing and thawing cells for three cycles 80 C. for 10 min 37 C. and then centrifuged at 13 000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant was collected and 100 microliters was added to each scaffold. The supernatant loaded scaffolds were placed in a shaker for 20 minutes to encourage incorporation of supernatant into the scaffolds. The supernatant loaded scaffolds were then lyophilized in tissue culture plates prior to implantation in the rat.

The Growth medium control group was prepared by adding 100 microliters of Growth medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum to each scaffold these scaffolds were washed with PBS three times after the addition of growth medium. These scaffolds were then lyophilized in tissue culture plates prior to implantation in the rat.

The scaffold alone groups were prepared by adding 100 microliters of PBS to each scaffold. The scaffolds were then lyophilized in tissue culture plates prior to implantation in the rat.

The 3 w w 35 65 PCL PGA sample was analyzed for percent porosity and pore size distribution analysis using helium picnometry and mercury porosimetry respectively Quantochrome Instruments Boynton Beach Fla. . The percent porosity was in the range of about 97 to 98 and the mean of bimodal pore size distribution was 55.5. This scaffold batch was made from a copolymer epsilon caprolactone glycolide which was analyzed for molar composition of epsilon caprolactone and glycolide and residual monomers. 35 mole and 63.3 mole were determined for epsilon caprolactone and glycolide respectively and 0.11 mole of CAP and 0.58 mole of GLY. The morphology of pores was analyzed by SEM method.

The VNW scaffold used in this study was 2.06 mm thick. The density as determined by Biomechanical Structures was 108.49 mg cc. The percent porosity was calculated to be 92.8 . The VNW was tested in triplicate for residual IPA and residual ethylene oxide EtO . The samples all demonstrated less than 1 ppm residual IPA. The residual EtO levels in the VNW were 8 9 and 10 ppm. The residual EtO in each sample was much less than the 250 ppm limit.

Each rat was anesthetized via Isoflurane inhalant anesthesia. After induction of anesthesia the entire back of the animal from the dorsal cervical area to the dorsal lumbrosacral area was clipped free of hair using electric animal clippers. The area was then scrubbed with Chlorhexidine diacetate rinsed with alcohol dried and painted with an aqueous iodophor solution of 1 available iodine. The anesthetized and surgically prepared animal was placed in the desired recumbent position.

Four skin incisions each approximately 1.0 cm in length were made on the dorsum of the rat. Two cranial sites were located transversely over the dorsal lateral thoracic region about 2 cm caudal to the palpated inferior edge of the scapula with one to the left and one to the right of the vertebral column. Another two were placed transversely over the gluteal muscle area at the caudal sacrolumbar level about 1 cm caudal to the palpated iliac crest with one on either side of the midline. The skin was separated from the underlying connective tissue to make a small pocket and the implant placed about 1 cm caudal to the incision. Six mm implants were placed in these sites according to the predetermined randomized implantation scheme. The skin incisions were closed with metal wound clips.

At the predetermined time points 3 and 14 days post implant the animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation. The animals were observed to ensure that respiratory function had ceased and there was no palpable cardiac function.

Immediately following euthanasia each subcutaneous implantation site with the overlying skin was excised. The wound was fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for hematoxylin and eosin by PAI Associates Charles River Laboratories West Chester Ohio .

Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the percentage of ingrowth into the scaffold the quality of ingrowth into the scaffold the encapsulation of the scaffold and inflammatory response within the scaffold.

Samples tested at day 3 included UDC lysate UDC supernatant HF and VNW scaffold. All treatments were incorporated into the VNW scaffold. The purpose of a three day time point was to determine if there was an immediate immune response to the implanted cellular components.

At the time of necropsy the ventral surface of each implant was evaluated for the amount of vascularization. A difference was observed at day 3 in the degree of vascularization and position of the wound. The cranial sites were more vascularized. No clinical evidence of immune response was noted at this timepoint.

As expected at day 3 all treatment groups demonstrated very limited ingrowth with some presence of inflammatory cells. Three sites 1 UDC supernatant and 2 HF demonstrated some fibrovascular ingrowth. Two sites 1 UDC lysate and 1 VNW demonstrated relatively acellular implants at day 3 post implantation.

The majority 3 of 4 sites of the UDC lysate UDC supernatant and VNW scaffold demonstrated typical ingrowth macrophages neutrophils and lymphocytes as expected on day 3 post implantation. One site each of UDC lysate and VNW scaffold had less than the normal amount of ingrowth at day 3. One UDC supernatant site demonstrated more fibrovascular ingrowth as compared to other sites. All of the four HF sites had several clumps of large irregular cells dark granular eosinophilic cytoplasm nuclei were quite variable in color . Two of the four HF sites also demonstrated more fibrovascular ingrowth.

The treatments incorporated into the foam scaffold demonstrated a wide range of ingrowth. The average amount of ingrowth ranged from about 31 to 90 . In general there was more ingrowth seen in the cranial sites.

The treatments incorporated into the VNW demonstrated a narrower range of ingrowth into the scaffold. The average amount of ingrowth ranged from about 69 to 100 . All cranial sites with VNW demonstrated the same or more ingrowth than the caudal sites.

This measurement examined the ingrowth of fibroblasts and capillaries in between the foreign body reaction zones more specifically around the fibrils of the VNW scaffold. This parameter was scored as 0 below notable level the elements were present but there was nothing notable about the amount 0.5 trace notable 1 minimal small increase in the elements 2 slight greater increase in the elements 3 moderate greatest increase on this comparative scale . All sites averaged between minimal and slight. Table 18 1.

This measurement evaluated the collagen deposition in the spaces between fibrils of the VNW. This parameter was scored as 0 below notable level the elements were present but there was nothing notable about the amount 0.5 trace notable 1 minimal small increase in the elements 2 slight greater increase in the elements 3 moderate greatest increase on this comparative scale . All sites averaged between minimal and slight. Table 18 2.

The inflammatory response was graded at each site. The grades were 1 minimal 2 slight 3 moderate 4 pronounced.

For the foams the grade minimal was given for reactions mainly concentrated at the surface of the material with no significant extension into the scaffold or outwards from the surface. Slight indicated partial cellular infiltration of the scaffold as noted above but with no significant cellular response outwards from the surface. Foams were given a moderate score when there was total or almost total infiltration of the cell types noted above but there was no significant extension of the reaction beyond the surface of the scaffold. A pronounced score indicated that in addition to the moderate score there was a pronounced degree of inflammatory cell infiltration surrounding the scaffold or the primary response to the material was neutrophilic.

For the VNW the grade minimal indicated only small collections of cells around individual fibers or fiber bundles and these infiltrates did not tend to coalesce. Slight reactions for VNWs were given when there were greater concentrations of the cell types noted above plus possibly other mononuclear cells . VNWs were given a moderate score when there was total or almost total infiltration of the cell types noted above but there was no significant extension of the reaction beyond the surface of the scaffold. A pronounced score indicated that in addition to the moderate score there was a pronounced degree of inflammatory cell infiltration surrounding the scaffold or the primary response to the material was neutrophilic. Table 18 3.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of human umbilicus cell derived lysate when delivered in a scaffold to induce cellular infiltration and tissue formation upon in vivo administration for example when implanted subcutaneously in a rat. Two types of scaffolds VNW and 35 65 PCL PGA foam were tested to determine their potential to act as carriers for lysate delivery. Both scaffolds elicited a minimal to slight inflammatory reaction.

A limited number of samples were tested at day 3 UDC lysate UDC supernatant HF and scaffold alone for potential immune inflammatory response. This was done because of the xenogeneic nature of the cell source. All treatments evaluated at three days were incorporated into the VNW scaffold. It had been proposed that the UDC cells are immunoprivileged but to this point they had never been implanted into a non immunocompromised animal. No immunological responses were noted very limited inflammatory cellular infiltrates mainly macrophages some residual neutrophils and rare lymphocytes were seen at this time point. These observations are typical after a three day implantation period. Any inflammatory response that was seen was scored as minimal at day three.

This study was designed so that each animal had a control of each scaffold type and one treatment group of each scaffold type. This was done because in a previous experiment a difference was seen between the cranial and caudal implantation sites. Differences were also seen in this study at the cranial versus caudal sites. Although this study cannot be analyzed statistically due to the low n number there were several positive findings of interest. The amount of ingrowth into the foams was increased in the UDC supernatant and HF cell groups. Additionally the amount of ingrowth into the VNW differed the greatest in the UDC cells caudal as opposed to the VNW scaffold caudal . The cranial sites demonstrated near 100 ingrowth for all VNW treatment groups. In the cranial sites of the UDC supernatant there was increased cellularity of ingrowth fibroblasts and capillaries within the VNW scaffold as compared to the VNW alone. There appeared to be an increase in the amount of collagen deposition within the VNW scaffold for the UDC lysate group caudal sites the UDC supernatant and HF groups cranial sites .

As expected the Growth medium control group negative control appeared to impact the scaffolds in a negative way. The amount of ingrowth into the foam and VNW caudal sites was diminished. The caudal VNW sites demonstrated no collagen deposition for the Growth medium controls.

Of particular note in this study was the effect of position on tissue ingrowth in this model. Scaffolds which were located in the cranial position in general had significantly more tissue ingrowth than those scaffolds located in the caudal position. The sites which were located in the caudal position could be thought of as a delayed tissue ingrowth model since at 14 days post implantation there was a subjective grade of 1 on a scale of 1 3 with the cranial sites equal to 2 or greater. When testing multiple methods of preparing the lysate all caudal sites treated with three different UDC lysates showed more tissue ingrowth and collagen deposition when compared to three identical methods used to prepare lysate from Human Fibroblasts.

Even though no statistical conclusions can be made from this study the data obtained suggest that the UDC supernatant preparation has a positive impact on cellular infiltration. The UDC supernatant group demonstrated increases in cellularity of ingrowth and collagen deposition in the VNW scaffold.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether increased cell infiltration and extracellular matrix deposition in response to scaffolds treated with cell lysate would provide statistical significance when repeated with a larger number of animals per treatment group.

The cellular components of human umbilicus derived cells UDC human dermal fibroblasts and Growth medium were loaded on scaffold and were tested to evaluate the cell infiltration and inflammatory response elicited in a subcutaneous rat implantation study. These were compared to the scaffold alone. All treatments were lyophilized prior to implantation.

No immunological responses were noted in this study. The amount of inflammatory response for all groups ranged from minimal to slight.

The amount of ingrowth into the VNW was very similar across the treatment groups both in the cranial and caudal positions. The UDC Supernatant demonstrated significantly increased cellularity of ingrowth fibroblasts and capillaries within the VNW scaffold as compared to the GM Control and the VNW alone. The UDC Supernatant demonstrated greater cellularity of ingrowth at both the cranial and caudal sites compared to all other treatments. Collagen deposition was statistically greater for the cranial sites compared to GM Control and Scaffold Control. Additionally the caudal sites demonstrated statistically greater collagen deposition than the Scaffold Control.

In conclusion two subcutaneous rat studies have been completed to assess tissue ingrowth and inflammatory reaction to scaffolds treated with cell lysates from UDC or HF. In both studies there was increased tissue ingrowth and extracellular matrix deposition in scaffolds treated with lysate according to qualitative histopathology assessment. In addition this positive tissue response may be considered to be of greater quality based generally on both cellular infiltration and inflammatory response due to the decreased inflammatory response to UDC as compared to HF.

Four 4 subcutaneous pockets 2 cranial 2 caudal were created on the dorsal region of 32 rats. The treatment groups were assigned to the sites and left in place throughout the study period. The treatments 6 mm punches were placed flat into the subcutaneous pocket. The implants were placed approximately 1 cm caudal to the incision. Metal wound clips were used to close the incision. Tissues were harvested from the animals on day 14. The entire scaffold and surrounding skin was excised. The excised tissue was placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin for histological processing paraffin sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome. Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the percentage of ingrowth into the scaffold the quality of ingrowth into the scaffold the encapsulation of the scaffold and inflammatory response within the scaffold.

The VNW was purchased from Biomedical Structures Slatersville R.I. . The scaffolds were placed in desiccant paper pillows that were then packaged in T vent aluminum pouches and sterilized via EtO sterilization nominal B cycle . The scaffolds were stored at room temperature prior to use. The following treatment groups were included in the study 

VNWs were scoured to remove residual processing oils. The material was scoured twice. The VNW was agitated in isopropanol IPA in the BRANSON ULTRASONIC CLEANER BUC for at least 30 minutes. The IPA was drained and the VNW was washed with deionized water three times. The VNW was then agitated in deionized water in the BUC for an additional 30 minutes. The VNW was dried under vacuum overnight or until dry to the touch.

Human umbilicus derived cells UDCs and human skin fibroblasts HF at passage 11 were seeded into gelatin coated T225 flasks. Flasks were trypsinized with 0.05 trypsin EDTA for 5 minutes until the cells began lifting from the dish. The trypsinization process was inactivated using 15 serum containing Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s growth media at a ratio of 4 milliliters trypsin to 4 milliliters Growth media. Twelve million cells were obtained for both UDCs and HFs. Cells were pelleted in Growth media combined into one pellet and then resuspended in a total volume of 20 milliliters of PBS. The cells were washed three times in PBS to remove residual FBS from the Growth media. This was done by centrifuging the cells for 5 minutes at 1.5 RPM and then resuspending the cells in 20 ml of PBS until the three washes were complete.

The lysates were prepared by repeated freeze thaw cycles. The cell pellets UDC and HF were resuspended in 425 microliters of PBS. To freeze the cells the tubes were placed in a slurry of dry ice and isopropanol for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes the tubes were placed in a 37 C. water bath for 10 minutes. This procedure was repeated for a total of three cycles of freezing and thawing.

The cell suspensions were transferred to sterile siliconized microcentrifuge tubes to prevent protein adsorption and centrifuged at 13 000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C. to separate the cell membranes from the cytosolic components. After removal of the cell membranes the supernatant was gently mixed by tapping the centrifuge tube to ensure uniformity. The supernatant was transferred to new siliconized tubes and placed on ice. Approximately 425 microliters of UDC supernatant was collected. To ensure that there was enough UDC supernatant to be loaded onto the scaffolds 50 microliters of PBS was added to make a final volume of 475 microliters.

Sterile VNW scaffolds 6 mm punches were aseptically transferred to sterile multi well plates. 25 microliters of cell lysate supernatant UDC or HF were placed on the VNW the drop of cell lysate sank into the scaffold. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. The dishes were then immediately placed on dry ice until lyophilization.

Sterile VNW scaffolds 6 mm punches were aseptically transferred to sterile multi well plates. 30 microliters of Hayflick media was placed in the same manner onto each of the scaffolds as described above. The scaffolds were washed three times in PBS to remove residual media. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. The dishes were then immediately placed on dry ice until lyophilization.

Sterile VNW scaffolds 6 mm punches were aseptically transferred to sterile multi well plates. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. The dishes were then immediately placed on dry ice until lyophilization.

The treatments were lyophilized using a 48 hour lyophilization cycle. After the lyophilization was complete the dishes were wrapped in parafilm and stored at 80 C. until the day of surgery. On the day of surgery the treatments were removed from the freezer and placed into a foil covered ice bucket to prevent proteolytic activity.

VNW scaffold Lot 355 73 1 was purchased from Biomedical Structures Slatersville R.I. . The VNW scaffold used in this study was 2.06 mm thick. The density as determined by Biomedical Structures was 108.49 mg cc. The percent porosity was calculated to be 92.8 . The sample demonstrated less than 1 ppm residual IPA. Residual ethylene oxide EtO levels were tested four times. The residual EtO levels in the VNW were 130 132 133 and 137 ppm. The residual EtO in the sample was much less than the 250 ppm limit.

Prior to use of the cells preliminary pathogen testing was conducted. The cells were tested for HIV1 HIV2 HCV HTLV HBV and EBV. Detection of virus DNA and RNA was done via PCR. The cells tested negative for all viruses.

This study was conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Ethicon Research Development Somerville N.J.

The scaffolds were placed in desiccant paper pillows that were then packaged in T vent aluminum pouches and sterilized via EtO sterilization nominal B cycle . The scaffolds were stored at room temperature prior to use. The cell isolates were co lyophilized with the scaffolds in an aseptic manner.

Each rat was anesthetized via Isoflurane inhalant anesthesia. After induction of anesthesia the entire back of the animal from the dorsal cervical area to the dorsal lumbrosacral area was clipped free of hair using electric animal clippers. The area was then scrubbed with Chlorhexidine diacetate rinsed with alcohol dried and painted with an aqueous iodophor solution of 1 available iodine. The anesthetized and surgically prepared animal was placed in the desired recumbent position.

Four skin incisions each approximately 1.0 cm in length were made on the dorsum of the rat. Two cranial sites were located transversely over the dorsal lateral thoracic region about 2 cm caudal to the palpated inferior edge of the scapula with one to the left and one to the right of the vertebral column. Another two were placed transversely over the gluteal muscle area at the caudal sacrolumbar level about 1 cm caudal to the palpated iliac crest with one on either side of the midline. The skin was separated from the underlying connective tissue to make a small pocket and the implant placed about 1 cm caudal to the incision. Six mm implants were placed in these sites according to the predetermined randomized implantation scheme. The skin incisions were closed with metal wound clips.

At the predetermined time point 14 days post implant the animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide inhalation. Immediately following euthanasia each subcutaneous implantation site with its overlying skin was excised. The wound was fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for hematoxylin and eosin.

Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the percentage of ingrowth into the scaffold the quality of ingrowth into the scaffold the encapsulation of the scaffold and inflammatory response within the scaffold.

Treatments were assigned so that the UDC Supernatant HF Supernatant and GM Control were equally distributed over the cranial and caudal wounds. The Scaffold Control was paired to each cranial or caudal wound. Shapiro Wilk W Test was performed prior to data analysis to determine normality. Nominal and Ordinal data was analyzed using Chi Square. Continuous data was analyzed using One way ANOVA. The Tukey Kramer test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine differences between groups following One way ANOVA. A value of p

There was no statistical difference between the treatments for the amount of in growth into the scaffold. All treatments ranged from 92.64 to 97.94 ingrowth. The cranial sites demonstrated numerically superior amount of ingrowth than the caudal sites although the difference is not significant. See Table 19 1.

This measurement examined the ingrowth of fibroblasts and capillaries in between the foreign body reaction zones more specifically around the fibrils of the VNW scaffold. This parameter was scored as follows 0 below notable level the elements e.g. capillaries and fibroblasts were present but there was nothing notable about the amount 0.5 trace notable 1 minimal small increase in the elements 2 slight greater increase in the elements 3 moderate greatest increase on this comparative scale .

The inflammatory response was graded at each site. The responses were graded as follows 1 minimal 2 slight 3 moderate 4 pronounced.

For VNWs the grade minimal indicated only small collections of cells macrophages and macrophage giant cells around individual fibers or fiber bundles and these infiltrates did not tend to coalesce. Slight reactions for VNWs were given when there were greater concentrations of the cell types macrophages and macrophage giant cells plus possibly other mononuclear cells . VNWs were given a moderate score when there was total or almost total infiltration of the cell types noted above but there was no significant extension of the reaction beyond the surface of the scaffold. A pronounced score indicated that in addition to the moderate score there was a pronounced degree of inflammatory cell infiltration surrounding the scaffold or if the primary response to the material was neutrophilic.

There were no statistical differences demonstrated among the groups for inflammatory response. All treatment groups performed very similarly. The average scores for the groups ranged from 1.18 to 1.58. No differences were determined when the data was split into cranial and caudal sites. See Table 19 4.

Two well documented models of wound healing are the swine full thickness excisional wound model and the rat subcutaneous implant model. The swine model has utility because of similarity of the cutaneous architecture to that of human skin. The rat model is most often used to assess biocompatibility and tissue ingrowth. Therefore these models are the preferred models used to screen prototype devices. Based on the tissue reaction tissue infiltration extracellular matrix deposition and the inflammatory response in these acute models the efficacy of a device for chronic wound healing is inferred.

This was a randomized study to evaluate the ability of human umbilicus derived cell lysate to stimulate cell invasion in a rat subcutaneous implantation model. Comparators in this study were human skin fibroblast derived cell lysate growth medium control and scaffold control. We chose to only evaluate the VNW scaffold in this study because this scaffold is more readily infiltrated in the rat subcutaneous model than the foam. This study was designed so that each animal had a VNW control both cranially and caudally in addition it was ensured that the other treatments were randomized equally across the cranial and caudal positions to minimize a potential difference in tissue response due to the anatomical position. This was done because in a previous experiment a difference was seen between the cranial and caudal implantation sites. Differences were observed in this study at the cranial versus caudal sites. One possible explanation for the differences between the implantation sites is that the cranial sites are more vascularized due to the anatomical position than the caudal sites.

No immunological responses were noted in this study. The amount of inflammatory response for all groups ranged from minimal to slight. The types of cells seen were predominantly PMNs polymorphonuclear neutrophils and mononuclear cells. The HF Supernatant group had the most notations of inflammatory cells in association with the scaffold. Six of 14 sites had notations of PMNs and mononuclear cells within the scaffold three additional sites had notations of PMNs alone within the scaffold. Of these nine sites four were cranial and five were caudal sites. The GM Control group and the UDC Supernatant group had notations of inflammatory cells in 5 and 4 sites respectively.

When comparing the overall quality of tissue which has grown into the scaffolds several conclusions could be drawn. In 10 14 UDC treated sites there were significantly more higher quality tissue e.g. having extracellular matrix and cellular components including fibroblasts and endothelial cells when compared to the untreated scaffold within the same animal. In 9 14 HF treated sites there were significantly more higher quality tissue when compared to the untreated scaffold within the same animal. Importantly when comparing the amount of inflammatory cell infiltration between the groups it was noted that UDC treated scaffolds exhibited only a slightly increased inflammatory response in 6 14 sites compared to 5 14 growth media controls. When comparing this result to the HF treated scaffold 9 14 sites exhibited an increased inflammatory response. This demonstrates that inflammatory response of UDC treated scaffold was similar to GM control scaffold while the HF treated groups exhibited increased inflammation.

An important consideration when examining the inflammatory response to these lysates is that this study is an example of xenogeneic transplantation with human cells being transplanted into a rodent model. It is expected that a degree of inflammation would be present as the host animal reacts to the introduction of human cells. Interestingly the UDC lysate groups performed similar to that of the control scaffolds with regard to inflammatory response.

The amount of ingrowth into the VNW was very similar across the treatment groups both in the cranial and caudal positions. The UDC Supernatant demonstrated significantly increased cellularity of ingrowth fibroblasts and capillaries within the VNW scaffold as compared to the GM Control and the VNW alone. Collagen deposition was statistically greater for the cranial sites compared to GM Control and Scaffold Control. Additionally the caudal sites demonstrated statistically greater collagen deposition than the Scaffold Control.

The GM Control demonstrated reduced amounts of cellularity of ingrowth and greater collagen deposition than the Scaffold Control.

In conclusion two subcutaneous rat studies have been completed to assess tissue ingrowth and inflammatory reaction to scaffolds treated with cell lysates from UDC or HF. In both studies there was increased tissue ingrowth and extracellular matrix deposition in scaffolds treated with lysate. In addition this positive tissue response may be considered to be of greater quality due to the decreased inflammatory response to UDCs compared to HFs.

UDCs produce various growth factors involved in tissue regeneration including basic Fibroblast Growth Factor bFGF hepatocyte growth factor HGF brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF and keratinocyte growth factor KGF . The supernatant of lysed UDCs also has been demonstrated to contain these growth factors. The application of the lysate to biomaterials followed by lyophilization produces a device that upon clinical application will deliver the growth factors to the defect site and enhance tissue regeneration.

The present study evaluated the ability of UDC lysate lyophilized onto a material to increase mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblast proliferation when co cultured in a transwell system. Collagen oxidized regenerated cellulose ORC containing lyophilized UDC lysate was placed in the upper portion of a transwell system and co cultured with mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts plated at low density in the lower portion of the system. After three days the cells were harvested and counted. The transwells containing materials were transferred to new transwell systems and again co cultured with mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts plated at low density in the lower portion of the system. After an additional three days six days total material time in culture the cells were harvested and counted. This second culture timepoint was performed to assess the release kinetics of the UDC lysate from the biomaterial.

After three days a near significant t test p 0.06 increase in proliferation was noted in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts co cultured with collagen ORC containing UDC lysate versus collagen ORC alone. After the transwells containing materials were transferred to new systems and co cultured for an additional three days six days total material time in culture a near significant t test p 0.09 increase in proliferation was again noted in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts co cultured with collagen ORC containing UDC lysate versus collagen ORC alone.

These results demonstrate the ability of growth factors from lyophilized UDC lysate to be released from a material and exhibit biological efficacy. The ability of the materials to exhibit biological efficacy after transfer to new transwell systems demonstrated that growth factors of lyophilized UDC lysate were released over time.

Collagen ORC pre cut to 1.5 1.5 cmin size were aseptically placed into the wells of 12 well sterile ultra low cluster cell culture dishes Corning Inc. Corning N.Y. . The supernatant fluid was applied to the material as five 30 microgram aliquots. An aliquot was placed at each corner of the 1.5 1.5 cmmaterial approximately 1 mm from the material edge and one aliquot was placed in the center of the material. The dish with materials was loaded into the lyophilizer.

Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the ramping program set forth in Example 17. All steps had a ramping rate of 2.5 C. minute and a 100 mT vacuum.

Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts ATCC CRL 1658 were expanded in growth media DMEM high glucose with 10 fetal calf serum and penicillin streptomycin . All treatments were in triplicate.

The mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were plated into the lower portion of a 6 well transwell plate Corning cat. no. 3412 at 5 000 cells per cmand cultured overnight. The media was removed by aspiration and the appropriate media 2.5 ml per well 1.5 ml per transwell transwells and treatments were added. On day 3 transwell containing materials were removed and transferred to new 6 well plates that were seeded with NIH 3T3 at 5 000 cells per cmand the prior day. Cells in transwells were harvested by trypsinization and counted using a Guava PCA instrument Guava Technologies Hayward Calif. 

Table 20 1 shows the number of cells per well 6 well plate after 3 days transwell co culture with treatment as calculated by Guava PCA Instrument.

Table 20 2 shows the number of cells per well 6 well plate after 3 days transwell co culture with transferred treatment total six days in study as calculated by Guava PCA Instrument.

A near significant increase in proliferation t test p 0.06 was noted in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts co cultured with collagen ORC treated with 300 micrograms UDC lysate in transwell versus collagen ORC in transwell for three days.

A near significant increase in proliferation t test p 0.09 was noted in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts co cultured with collagen ORC treated with 300 micrograms UDC lysate in transwells transferred from the first three days of the study versus collagen ORC in transwells transferred from the first three days of the study for three days total 6 days material in study .

After three days a near significant t test p 0.06 increase in proliferation was note in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts co cultured with collagen ORC containing UDC lysate versus collagen ORC alone. After the transwells containing materials were transferred to new systems and co cultured for an additional three days a near significant t test p 0.09 increase in proliferation was again noted in mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts co cultured with collagen ORC containing UDC lysate versus collagen ORC alone.

These results demonstrated the ability of lyophilized UDC lysate to be released from a material and to exhibit biological efficacy. The ability of the materials to exhibit biological efficacy after transfer to new transwell systems demonstrated the proliferative factors of lyophilized UDC lysate were released over time.

The purpose of this study was to determine the cellular infiltration and inflammatory response of human umbilicus cell derived UDC cell lysate when delivered in a scaffold of a swine full thickness excisional defect. This study was designed to determine the cellular infiltration of full thickness excisional defects in the presence of scaffolds that have been lyophilized with an active agent.

As demonstrated in the data obtained from quantitative histomorphometry a statistically significant increase in granulation tissue area average granulation tissue height and greatest granulation tissue height when compared to all other treatment groups. However the overall grade of the quality of the granulation tissue was poor. This assessment was based on the increased inflammatory cell presence in the large volume of tissue which had filled the scaffolds. This increased inflammatory cell presence may be attributed to the timepoint for analysis 7 day study or the cell concentration in this model. When the groups were ranked to exclude one pig because of cell concentration differences the cell lysate alone group showed an inflammatory cell presence similar to that of untreated controls with positive effects seen for epithelial tongue length cell infiltration greatest granulation tissue height and average granulation tissue height.

The data generated from the two subcutaneous rat studies and this swine full thickness excisional wound model indicate that treatment of wounds scaffolds with cell lysate has a stimulatory effect on tissue ingrowth.

Twelve 12 full thickness excisions 1.5 1.5 cm were created on the dorsal region of four swine. The treatment groups were assigned to the sites and left in place throughout the study period. Each animal had an equal distribution of the treatment groups. The treatment squares 1.5 1.5 cm were trimmed to fit the wound if needed and covered with 2 2 cm NU GEL Johnson Johnson Medical Arlington Tex. . All wounds were then covered with BIOCLUSIVE Id. . Strips of self adhering foam RESTON 3M Medical Surgical Division St. Paul Minn. were placed between sites to prevent cross contamination due to wound fluid leakage. Sterile gauze RAY TEK Johnson Johnson Medical Arlington Tex. was secured over the dorsum of the back with ZONAS Id. porous tape. A body stockinette SPANDAGE Medi tech International Corporation Brooklyn N.Y. was used to hold the dressings in place. Digital images of each wound were taken at days 0 4 and 7 post wounding. A bandage change was done on day 4 of the study. Tissues were harvested from the animals on day 7. The entire wound and surrounding normal skin was excised. The cranial half of the excised tissue was placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin for histological processing paraffin sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome. The caudal portion of each sample was retained for possible future analysis. Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the presence of the scaffold overgrowth of scaffold by granulation tissue quality of ingrowth and inflammatory response. Measurements of granulation tissue area and epithelial tongue length were also made.

The VNW scaffold was purchased from Biomedical Structures Slatersville R.I. . The samples were foil wrapped and sterilized via EtO sterilization and stored at room temperature prior to use.

Scouring occurred after the VNW was obtained from the supplier. The VNW was agitated in IPA in the BRANSONIC ULTRASONIC CLEANER BUC for at least 30 minutes. The IPA was drained and the VNW was washed with deionized water three times. The VNW was then agitated in deionized water in the BUC for an additional 30 minutes. The VNW was dried under vacuum overnight or until dry to the touch.

Approximately 25 million human umbilicus derived cells UDCs at passage 11 were seeded into gelatin coated T225 flasks. Because of the number of cells that were necessary to complete the study the flasks were split for trypsinization into two sets which were combined to prepare the cell lysate. The cells ranged from approximately 70 95 confluent. Flasks were trypsinized with 0.05 trypsin EDTA for 5 minutes until the cells began lifting from the dish. The trypsinization process was inactivated using Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Growth media containing 15 serum. A total of 34 million cells were obtained from the first batch and approximately 58 million cells were obtained from the second batch the total yield was approximately 92 million cells. Cells were pelleted in Growth media combined into one pellet and then resuspended in a total volume of 40 milliliters of PBS. The cells were washed three times in PBS to remove residual FBS from the growth media. This was done by centrifuging the cells for 5 minutes at 1.5 RPM and then resuspending the cells in 40 milliliters of PBS until the three washes were complete.

In order to facilitate the freeze thaw procedure the cells were equally divided into two tubes with 9.2 ml of PBS for the freeze thaw procedure. The lysates were prepared by repeated freeze thaw cycles. To freeze the cells the tubes were placed in a slurry of dry ice and isopropanol for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes the tubes were placed in a 37 C. water bath for 10 minutes. After two cycles the cycle time was lengthened to 20 minutes to ensure that complete thawing freezing of the samples had occurred.

The cell suspensions were transferred to ten sterile siliconized microcentrifuge tubes to prevent protein adsorption and centrifuged at 13 000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C. to separate the cell membranes from the cytosolic components. The tubes cell pellet were then placed on ice and the supernatant was very gently mixed by tapping the centrifuge tube to ensure uniformity. The supernatant was transferred to new siliconized tubes and placed on ice.

Cell lysate supernatant was pipetted into a sterile 96 well deep well dish conical bottom . Wells were marked to indicate presence of lysate. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. At the time of surgery the lysate from 5 million cells was reconstituted with 550 microliters of PBS. Approximately 250 microliters was applied to each of the wounds on pig one. The approximate cell lysate concentration added to the wounds on pig 1 was 2.5 million cells wound. Upon treatment of pig 1 it was apparent that much of the volume of the reconstituted cell lysate did not remain in the wound bed. Therefore less volume of cell lysate was used to treat pigs 2 4. The approximate cell concentration applied to wounds on pigs 2 4 was 0.5 1 million cells wound.

Cell Lysate VNW Sterile VNW scaffolds 1.5 1.5 cm were aseptically transferred to sterile multi well plates. 400 microliters of cell lysate supernatant were placed next to the VNW the dish was tilted to wick in the suspension since it appeared that the VNW would wick better from the sides than the top of the VNW. After approximately 10 minutes VNW had absorbed the drop contents. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. The dishes were then immediately placed on dry ice until lyophilization.

VNW Sterile VNW scaffolds 1.5 1.5 cm were aseptically transferred to sterile multi well plates. The dish was covered with a sterile lid and taped to ensure the lid would stay in place during the lyophilization process. The dishes were then immediately placed on dry ice until lyophilization.

The treatments were lyophilized using a 48 hour lyophilization cycle. After the lyophilization was complete the dishes were wrapped in parafilm and stored at 80 C. until the day of surgery. On the day of surgery the treatments were removed from the freezer and placed into a foil covered ice bucket to prevent proteolytic activity.

VNW scaffold used in this study was 1.14 mm thick and had a density of 92.85 mg cc. These values were obtained by the supplier. The calculated percent porosity was 93.8 for this sample. The residual EtO was run four times and averaged 142 ppm. The residual IPA was less than 1 ppm.

Cells were subjected to preliminary pathogen testing prior to use. The pathogens tested for were HIV1 HIV2 HCV HTLV HBV and EBV. Detection of virus DNA and RNA was done via PCR. The cells tested negative for all viruses.

This study was conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Ethicon R D Somerville N.J.

Twelve 12 full thickness excisions 1.5 1.5 cm were created on the dorsal region of four female domestic swine Animal Biotech Industries Inc. Danboro Pa. . The treatment groups were assigned to the sites and left in place throughout the study period. Each animal had an equal distribution of the treatment groups. The treatment squares 1.5 1.5 cm were trimmed to fit the wound if needed and covered with 2 2 cm NU GEL Johnson Johnson Medical Arlington Tex. . All wounds were then covered with BIOCLUSIVE Johnson Johnson Medical Arlington Tex. . Strips of self adhering foam RESTON 3M Medical Surgical Division St. Paul Minn. were placed between sites to prevent cross contamination due to wound fluid leakage. Sterile gauze RAY TEK Johnson Johnson Medical Arlington Tex. was secured over the dorsum of the back with ZONAS Johnson Johnson Medical Arlington Tex. porous tape. A body stockinette SPANDAGE Medi Tech International Corporation Brooklyn N.Y. was used to hold the dressings in place. Digital images of each wound were taken at days 0 4 and 7 post wounding. A bandage change was done on day 4 of the study. Tissues were harvested from the animals on day 7. The entire wound and surrounding normal skin was excised. The cranial half of the excised tissue was placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin for histological processing paraffin sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome MPI Research Mattawan Mich. . The caudal portion of each sample was retained for possible future analysis. Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the presence of the scaffold overgrowth of scaffold by granulation tissue quality of ingrowth and inflammatory response. Measurements of granulation tissue area and epithelial tongue length were also made.

VNW scaffold was purchased from Biomedical Structures Slaterville R.I. . All VNW was obtained from lot 3551 73 2. The samples were foil wrapped and sterilized via ethylene oxide sterilization and stored at room temperature prior to use. The cell lysate was obtained from cell lot CBAT 050604B.

Each pig was anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of Telazol 4 mg kg Xylazine 4 mg kg and Glycopyrrolate 0.011 mg kg . The animal was maintained on Isoflurane via nosecone. Each pig was given a pre operation dose of Buprenorphine 0.02 mg kg IM at the time of surgical preparation.

The animals were prepared for surgery under general anesthesia. Hair was removed from the back shoulder side and flank regions. An antiseptic skin cleanser was applied.

Full thickness excisional wounds 1.5 1.5 cm were created along the dorsal paravertebral and flank areas with a scalpel. Twelve wounds were made on each animal six per side. Each wound was submitted to a treatment regime. The scaffolds were placed into the wound bed dry and then a few drops of sterile saline were added to the scaffold. Excised tissue measurements were recorded.

The test materials were undisturbed for the length of the study. The wounds were covered with a 2 2 cm square of NU GEL. The wounds were dressed with BIOCLUSIVE to keep the wounds moist and to keep the test articles and NU GEL in place. Strips of polyurethane foam RESTON were placed between the wounds to avoid cross contamination due to wound fluid leakage. The animals were dressed with 4 4 inch squares of RAY TEK and SPANDAGE to help keep dressings in place and the animal s back clean.

The secondary and tertiary bandages were changed on day 4 of the study. Dressing condition was evaluated daily to determine if additional bandage changes were necessary due to strikethrough displacement etc.

Clinical observations were performed at the end of the study under anesthesia just prior to euthanasia. Assessments included dressing conditions air exposure displacement and wound bed conditions inflammation re injury infection and wound level . At the predetermined time point 7 days post wounding the animals were euthanized under anesthesia with an intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium euthanasia solution Euthasol Diamond Animal Health Inc. Des Moines Iowa at 1 ml 10 lbs body weight via the marginal ear vein. Following administration of the drug the animals were observed to ensure that respiratory function had ceased and there was no palpable cardiac function. A stethoscope facilitated this process. The femoral artery was severed to insure euthanasia.

Immediately following euthanasia each wound along with the underlying fat and margin of surrounding skin was excised. The wound was bisected into cranial and caudal halves. The cranial half of the wound was fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for hematoxylin and eosin and Masson s trichrome.

A computer controlled motorized programmable slide scanning system was used in the process of image acquisition. Separate images of high magnification fields were acquired from a microscope. The images were tiled to preserve the integrity of the entire histological specimen. This allows accurate measurement of the entire tissue sample.

Images from the light microscope were captured into the computer memory via CCD camera and frame grabber board and subsequently analyzed using Image Pro 4.0 Image Analysis software. Capturing the image of the slide and applying the calibration feature of the imaging software at 2 magnification performed spatial calibration.

Histological evaluations for granulation tissue area and length and epithelialization were assessed using trichrome stained specimens using a magnification of 20 40 . Average granulation tissue height was determined by dividing the area by the length.

Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the presence of the scaffold overgrowth of scaffold by granulation tissue quality of in growth and inflammatory response.

Treatments were assigned using a Latin Square design. This was to ensure that each treatment would be assigned equally at each wound site and avoid any bias to wound position on the animal. Visual assessments were analyzed using JMP 4.0.4 software SAS Institute Incorporated Cary N.C. . Shapiro Wilk W Test was performed prior to data analysis to determine normality. Nominal and Ordinal data was analyzed using Chi Square. Continuous data was analyzed using One way ANOVA. Tukey Kramer or Student Newman Keuls SNK test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine differences between groups following One way ANOVA. A value of p

Surgery and anesthetic recovery were uneventful. All animals tolerated bandaging well. None of the surgically created wounds were healed by the day 7.

At the time of surgery each wound was measured with a caliper to determine thickness. There were no differences between the groups for excised tissue thickness. The average excised tissue thickness ranged from 1.84 mm to 1.97 mm.

Cell Lysate VNW demonstrated a statistically significant greater amount of granulation tissue area than all other treatments p

Cell Lysate VNW and VNW demonstrated statistically significant longer granulation tissue length than Cell Lysate and Untreated p

Two measurements of granulation tissue height were obtained average height and greatest height. Average height is calculated by dividing the granulation tissue area by the granulation tissue length. These parameters consider the entire depth of the wound not just what is visible above the native epidermis. Cell Lysate VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater average granulation tissue height than VNW and Untreated p

Cell Lysate VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater granulation tissue height than Untreated p

Untreated demonstrated statistically significant longer epithelial tongue length than Cell Lysate VNW p

Cell Lysate and Untreated wounds were not evaluated in this parameter. Cell Lysate VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater implant area than VNW p

This parameter takes into account the length of scaffold that was above the granulation tissue and epithelial tongues. This scaffold is considered exposed and will most likely be extruded from the wound. Cell Lysate VNW demonstrated statistically significant greater amount of exposed scaffold at the surface of the wound bed than VNW p

At each end of the scaffold the interaction between the scaffold and the tissue was graded as follows 1 VNW fibers were totally embedded with neo dermis with sufficient re epithelialization to cover the end of the scaffold 2 Re epithelialization had occurred over the surface of the tissue at the wound edge but VNW fibers were embedded into the epithelial tongue 3 Re epithelialization was not occurring in an orderly manner at the wound edge because the epidermal cells were either within the VNW fibers or were undermining the scaffold s edge. Cell Lysate and Untreated wounds were not evaluated for this parameter. Due to the compact scale of this parameter the data cannot be analyzed as continuous data and therefore Two way ANOVA cannot be performed. The average scores for this parameter ranged from 1.56 to 2.50.

This parameter was scored as follows 1 The overgrowth was approximately 0.5 to 1 mm thick with relative uniformity and complete coverage 2 Either there was variable depth of the overgrowth or relatively uniform depth of less than 0.5 mm but complete coverage nonetheless 3 Any conformation of the overgrowth but with one or more areas of lack of overgrowth totaling less than 10 of the surface area 4 As grade 3 but with lack of overgrowth totaling approximately 10 50 of surface area 5 As grade 4 but with lack of overgrowth totaling approximately 50 100 of the surface area 6 There was complete lack of overgrowth of the scaffold by granulation tissue and there was exudate within the outer portion of the scaffold.

Cell Lysate and Untreated wounds were not evaluated for this parameter. VNW demonstrated statistically significant better grades than Cell Lysate VNW for conformation of granulation over growth p

This parameter was a subjective ranking of slides. The scores are 1 The least amount in this group of slides 2 In the mid range for this group of slides 3 The highest amount for this group of slides. Half grades were assigned to sites that fell in between two grades. Untreated demonstrated statistically significant less inflammation within the granulation tissue than Cell Lysate VNW p

Histopathological evaluation was determined by evaluating the following parameters sloughing of the scaffold overgrowth of scaffold by granulation tissue inflammation within the overgrowth tissue presence of exudate and inflammation within the scaffold. An overall result grade was then given to each site based on the parameters listed above.

Two well documented models for wound healing are the swine full thickness excisional wound model and the rat subcutaneous implant model. The swine model has utility because of similarity of the cutaneous architecture to that of human skin. The rat model is most often used to assess biocompatibility and tissue ingrowth. Therefore these models are the preferred method used to screen prototype devices for the skin tissue engineering program. Based on the tissue reaction tissue infiltration extracellular matrix deposition and inflammatory response in these models the efficacy of a device for wound healing is inferred.

The purpose of this study was to determine the cellular infiltration and inflammatory response of VNW scaffolds lyophilized with active agents. Human umbilicus cell derived UDC cell lysate was the active agents tested in the porcine full thickness excisional model.

An important consideration when examining the inflammatory response to these lysates is that this study is an example of xenogeneic transplantation with human cells being transplanted into a swine model. It is expected that a degree of inflammation would be present as the host animal reacts to the introduction of human cells. Interestingly the UDC lysate groups performed similar to that of the control scaffolds with regard to inflammatory response in previous studies in rodent models Examples 18 and 19 . In both of the rodent studies no increase in inflammatory response was noted.

As demonstrated in the data obtained from quantitative histomorphometry there was a statistically significant increase in granulation tissue area average granulation tissue height and greatest granulation tissue height when compared to all other treatment groups. However the overall grade of the quality of the granulation tissue was poor. This assessment was based on the increased inflammatory cell presence in the large volume of tissue which had filled the scaffolds. Several important factors need to be considered when interpreting this data. It has been demonstrated in previous rat sub cutaneous implant studies Example 18 and 19 that cell lysate showed increased cell infiltration and greater extracellular matrix deposition at 14 days post implantation. The swine model was evaluated at 7 days post wounding. It is postulated that in the swine model by 14 days the observed increase in inflammatory cell presence may resolve. This may be reasonable to infer since it is known that in acute wound healing the normal inflammatory process usually resolves within 10 days post wounding. In fact the presence of inflammatory cells at day 7 may provide enhanced healing response in a chronic wound based on its ability to provide an acute inflammatory stimulus in addition to the added benefit of the growth factors and MMP inhibitors present in the lysate mixture. This strategy of adding an acute inflammatory stimulus has been used with success in recent years in several clinical studies Zuloff Shani et al. 2004 30 2 163 7 Danon et al. 1997 32 6 633 41 Danon et al. 1998 7 6 281 3 Frenkel et al. 2002 128 1 59 66 which have demonstrated the utility of adding exogenous macrophage suspensions to help stimulate nonhealing wounds.

The cell concentration used in the cell lysate VNW treatment group was equal to 4 million cells per scaffold. This concentration was equal to the dose areathat was seen have to beneficial effects in the rat subcutaneous model. A cell lysate alone group was included in this study to determine the interaction of the scaffold with the active agents. At the time of surgery the cell lysates were reconstituted for application to the wound bed. The intent of this study was to examine the same concentration of cell lysate which was incorporated into the lysate VNW group to the cell lysate alone group. At the time of surgery however it was determined that the volume of cell lysate to be administered to the wound bed was too great to maintain the treatment in place the volume of a 1.5 1.5 cm full thickness excisional wound was determined to be approximately 100 microliters due to the depth of the wound and the contour of the pig . Therefore the first pig was treated with approximately 2.5 million cells in 250 microliters. This was reduced further for pigs 2 4 when it was determined that this volume was also in excess of what was thought to reproducibly remain in the wound bed. The number of cells used in pigs 2 4 was approximately 0.5 1 million cells. When pig number 1 cell concentration of 2.5 million cells is excluded from the data the ranking for scaffold performance demonstrates that the cell lysate alone group performed the best out of all groups 5 rel good 1 ave followed closely by untreated control wounds 3 good 2 ave 1 rel poor compared to VNW scaffold alone pigs 2 4 3 rel poor 3 ave . This data would seem to indicate that in the swine full thickness wound model a lower cell lysate concentration may have a beneficial effect if the dose was optimized for the pigs. Another important aspect to consider with regard to the cell lysate alone group is the positive effect that was noted for epithelial tongue length. In addition the cell lysate group was also similar to untreated controls with regard to inflammation apoptosis and overall grade. This group demonstrated numerically superior epithelial outgrowth and showed similar tongue length to the untreated control. It may be assumed that the increased cell infiltration seen in this group coupled with the positive epithelial tongue data may have utility in chronic wound healing.

The data generated from the two subcutaneous rat studies and this swine full thickness excisional wound model indicate that treatment of wounds scaffolds with cell lysate has a stimulatory effect on tissue ingrowth.

Previous data generated in a swine model testing UDC lysate at day 7 post wounding Example 21 demonstrated a significant increase in granulation tissue formation with a slight increase in inflammatory response. It is believed that this phenomenon was due to the time point for evaluation 7 days post wounding it is believed that by 14 days the observed increase in inflammatory cell presence would resolve. This is reasonable to infer since it is known that in acute wound healing the normal inflammatory process usually resolves within 10 days post wounding.

The purpose of this study was to determine the cellular infiltration and inflammatory response of human UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a collagen ORC scaffold in a swine full thickness excisional wound defect. The addition of a scaffold or the scaffold with CL was not statistically more inflammatory than an untreated wound at 14 days. As expected there was a small mononuclear inflammatory cell response to any foreign body scaffold that is implanted into the body. However the addition of CL to the scaffold did not statistically increase this response.

Interestingly the UDC lysate groups performed similar to that of the control scaffolds with regard to inflammatory response in two rat subcutaneous wound studies Examples 18 and 19 and in this swine full thickness excision model.

This study suggests that the addition of UDC lysate to a scaffold does not increase the inflammatory response in an acute wound model.

Twelve 12 full thickness excisions 1.5 1.5 cm were created on the dorsal region of eight swine. The treatment groups were assigned to the sites and left in place throughout the study period. Each animal had an equal distribution of the treatment groups. The treatment squares 1.5 1.5 cm were covered with approximately 2 2 cm NU GEL Wound Dressing Johnson Johnson MEDICAL Limited Gargrave United Kingdom . All wounds were then covered with BIOCLUSIVE Transparent Dressing Johnson Johnson MEDICAL Limited Gargrave United Kingdom . Strips of self adhering foam RESTON 3M Medical Surgical Division St. Paul Minn. were placed between sites to prevent cross contamination due to wound fluid leakage. Lap sponges Hermitage Hospital Products Inc. Niantic Conn. were secured over the dorsum of the back with WATERPROOF Johnson Johnson MEDICAL Arlington Tex. tape. A body stockinette SPANDAGE Medi Tech International Corporation Brooklyn N.Y. was used to hold the dressings in place.

Animals were bandage changed on days 2 5 7 9 and 14. Digital images of each wound were taken during the bandage change.

Tissues were harvested from the animals on day 14. The entire wound and surrounding normal skin was excised. The cranial half of the excised tissue was placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin for histological processing paraffin sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome. The caudal portion of each sample was retained for future analysis.

Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the presence of the scaffold overgrowth of scaffold by granulation tissue quality of ingrowth and inflammatory response. Measurements of granulation tissue area and epithelial tongue length were also made.

Umbilical cords were obtained for research purposes with patient consent. Cell isolation and culture were performed as per patent application WO2005 003334 A2.

Human UDCs were thawed from cryopreserved stocks and seeded into gelatin coated flasks at 5 000 cell cm. Expanded cells at 25 000 cell cm passage 10 were harvested with trypsin and counted. Cells were distributed into siliconized micro centrifuge tubes at 1.0E 07 pelleted by centrifugation and frozen at 80 C. Tubes containing the frozen cell pellets were placed in a 37 C. water bath thawed and then promptly placed in a liquid nitrogen bath. This procedure was repeated twice. Upon the last thaw the cell pellets were centrifuged at 13 000 g 4 C. for 10 minutes. The total protein content of the collected supernatant fluid was assessed by Bradford assay and the dose volume of supernatant fluid 30 micrograms total protein per material or 150 micrograms total protein per material was calculated. The dose volume of supernatant fluid was applied to the material as five one fifth total dose volume aliquots. An aliquot was placed at each corner of the 1.5 1.5 cm material approximately 1 mm from the material edge and one aliquot was placed in the center of the material. This ensured even distribution of lysate within the wound bed.

Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the ramping program of Example 17. All steps had a ramping rate of 2.5 C. minute and a 100 mT vacuum.

Analgesia was achieved using a Fentanyl patch 25 micrograms hour . The day before surgery a small area was shaved at the base of the neck and the patch was applied. On the day of surgery each pig was anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of Telazol 4 mg kg Xylazine 4 mg kg and Glycopyrrolate 0.011 mg kg . The animal was maintained on Isoflurane via endotracheal tube.

The animals were prepared for surgery under general anesthesia. Skin depilation from the back shoulder side and flank regions was accomplished with an electric animal clipper equipped with a surgical shaving blade 40 . The area was vacuumed to remove hair clippings and stratum corneum debris shaved with a razor and shaving cream and rinsed with tap water finally the animal was prepared for surgery with an application of an antiseptic skin cleanser.

Full thickness excisional wounds 1.5 1.5 cm were created along the dorsal paravertebral and flank areas with a scalpel. Twelve wounds were made on each animal six per side. Each wound was submitted to a treatment regimen. The scaffolds were placed into the wound bed dry and then a few drops of sterile saline were added to the scaffold. Excised tissue measurements were recorded.

The test materials were undisturbed for the length of the study. The wounds were covered with a 2 2 cmof NU GEL. The wounds were dressed with BIOCLUSIVE to keep the wounds moist and to keep the test articles and NU GEL in place. Strips of polyurethane foam Reston were placed between the wounds to avoid cross contamination due to wound fluid leakage. The animals were dressed with lap sponges and Spandage to help keep dressings in place and the animal s back clean.

The secondary and tertiary bandages were changed on days 2 or 3 5 7 and 9 of the study. Dressing condition was evaluated daily to determine if additional bandage changes were necessary due to strikethrough displacement etc.

After recovering from surgery and general anesthesia each pig was observed for behavioral signs of discomfort or pain. No signs of discomfort or pain were observed. Animals were returned to their cage when fully conscious and ambulatory.

The health status of each pig was determined by general appearance and attitude food consumption fecal and urinary excretion and the presence of abnormal discharges. Each pig was observed twice daily during the first 36 hours following surgery. Following recovery from surgery the observations were reduced to once daily until the end of the study.

Clinical observations were performed at the end of the study under anesthesia just prior to euthanasia. Assessments included dressing conditions air exposure displacement and wound bed conditions inflammation re injury infection and wound level .

At the predetermined time point 14 days post wounding the animals were euthanized under anesthesia with an intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium and phenytoin sodium euthanasia solution EUTHASOL at 1 ml 10 lbs body weight via the marginal ear vein. Following administration of the drug the animals were observed to ensure that respiratory function had ceased and there was no palpable cardiac function. A stethoscope facilitated this process. The femoral artery was severed to assure euthanasia.

Immediately following euthanasia each wound along with the underlying fat and margin of surrounding skin was excised. The wound was bisected into cranial and caudal halves. The cranial half of the wound was fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for hematoxylin and eosin and Masson s trichrome by MPI Research.

A computer controlled motorized programmable slide scanning system was used in the process of image acquisition. Separate images of high magnification fields were acquired from a microscope. The images were tiled to preserve the integrity of the entire histological specimen. This allows accurate measurement of the entire tissue sample.

Images from the light microscope were captured into the computer memory via CCD camera and frame grabber board and subsequently analyzed using Image Pro 4.0 Image Analysis software. The captured image of the slide was calibrated and measurements were recorded.

Quantitative histological measurements for granulation tissue area and length and epithelialization were assessed using trichrome stained specimens using a magnification of 20 40 . Average granulation tissue height was determined by dividing the area by the length.

Qualitative histopathology assessments were performed. Tissue sections were analyzed for the presence of the scaffold quality of in growth and inflammatory response.

Treatments were assigned using a Latin Square design. This was to ensure that each treatment would be assigned equally at each wound site and avoid any bias to wound position on the animal. Visual assessments were analyzed using JMP 4.0.4 software. Shapiro Wilk W Test was performed prior to data analysis to determine normality. Nominal and Ordinal data was analyzed using Chi Square. Continuous data was analyzed using One way ANOVA. Tukey Kramer or Student Newman Keuls SNK test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine differences between groups following One way ANOVA. A value of p

At the time of surgery each wound is measured with a caliper to determine thickness. There were no differences between the groups for excised tissue thickness. The average excised tissue thickness ranged from 1.94 mm to 2.05 mm.

Each animal was assessed for air exposure to the wound displacement of the secondary dressings channeling of wound fluid communication of wound fluid between wounds the amount of exudate present inflammation associated with the wound re injury the presence of clots or folliculitis infection erythema wound bed color and wound bed level on the days of bandage change and necropsy. The animals were assessed on days 2 5 7 9 and 14. Tables 22 2 and 22 3 summarize the findings.

There were no statistically significant differences among the treatment groups for granulation tissue area granulation tissue length average granulation tissue height amount of re epithelialization or percent re epithelialization. Table 22 1 summarizes the averages for each parameter.

Average granulation tissue height was calculated by dividing the area by the length. The percent re epithelialization was calculated based on the surface of the wound that was and was not covered by the epithelial tongues.

There were no statistical differences demonstrated between the treatment groups for rate of wound closure. Day 9 measurements were not included because the majority of wounds were not measurable due to a film of secondary dressing that covered the wound. The secondary dressing was not removed for fear of disturbing the wound bed.

There were no statistical differences the amount of inflammation that was present in the wound at day 14.

The Untreated group demonstrated statistically significant less mononuclear inflammatory cell foci than the Collagen ORC Low CL and Collagen ORC Mid CL the Collagen ORC p

The swine full thickness excisional wound model has utility for wound healing because of the similarity of the cutaneous architecture to that of human skin. This model is the preferred method used to screen prototype devices to determine whether there are effects on inflammatory cell infiltration in this acute wound healing model. However this type study does not assess efficacy on wound closure. To determine efficacy an impaired or delayed healing model will be used.

The purpose of this study was to determine the inflammatory response to UDC lysate lyophilized on a collagen ORC scaffold in the porcine full thickness excisional model. This study demonstrates that the addition of UDC lysate to scaffolds does not increase the inflammatory response.

An important consideration when examining the inflammatory response to these lysates is that this study is an example of xenogeneic transplantation with human cells being transplanted into a swine model. It is expected that a degree of inflammation would be present as the host animal reacts to the introduction of human cells. Interestingly the UDC lysate groups performed similar to that of the control scaffolds with regard to inflammatory response in two rat subcutaneous wound studies Examples 18 and 19 and in this swine full thickness excisional model.

In this acute healing model it was unlikely that an increase in the healing rates with the addition of an active agent would be observed because acute wounds heal rapidly without intervention. As expected no differences were observed in the rate of wound closure.

The addition of a scaffold or the scaffold with CL was not statistically more inflammatory than an untreated wound. As expected there is a small mononuclear inflammatory cell response to any foreign body scaffold that is implanted into the body. However the addition of CL to the scaffold did not statistically increase this response. In general the amount of inflammation seen in this study is innocuous and is suggestive of the typical response noted when any foreign material is implanted.

Ischemia results in impaired cutaneous wound healing by decreasing arterial perfusion at the wound site. The decrease in arterial perfusion deprives the wound site of oxygen and nutrients derived from arterial blood. An ischemic wound healing model has been developed in Sprague Dawley rats. This model contains non mildly and highly ischemic regions in which full thickness incisional wounds are created.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological effect of umbilicus derived cell UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a synthetic biomaterial in a rat full thickness incisional ischemic wound healing model. In this study UDCs were expanded in culture harvested lysed by repeated freeze thaw cycles applied to 90 10 PGA PLA non woven scaffolds at two protein concentrations 30 micrograms and 150 micrograms total protein per non woven scaffold and lyophilized. The lyophilized scaffolds were applied to rat full thickness excisional ischemic wounds.

Increased angiogenesis was observed in wounds treated with biomaterials containing UDC lysate compared to saline control with a greater than two fold increase in the angiogenic response in the biomaterials treated with 150 micrograms UDC lysate scaffold when compared to the saline control. Angiogenesis is the most critical factor to healing of an ischemic wound site and of chronic wounds in general. These results demonstrate the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a synthetic biomaterial in a rat full thickness excisional ischemic wound healing model.

Umbilical cords were obtained from The National Disease Research Interchange Philadelphia Pa. for research purposes with full patient consent. Cell isolation and culture were performed according to the methods of PCT Patent Publication WO2005 003334 A2.

Human UDC lysate supernatant was prepared as in Example 22. The cell lysate supernatant was applied to tested materials at 30 micrograms or 150 micrograms total protein per individual sample.

Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the ramping program set forth in Example 17.

Twenty n 8 treatment group location female Sprague Dawley Rats ranging from 200 to 350 grams in weight were obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley Inc. Indianapolis Ind. and Charles River Laboratories Portage Mich. . The animals were selected without any apparent systematic bias. The animals were identified by sequential numbering on the base of the tail with an indelible ink marker and or a subcutaneously implanted identification microchip.

Twenty rats 6 defects per animal 5 treatments n 8 R location cranial and caudal flap . An eccentric H flap is surgically created on the dorsum of the back. Six full thickness excisional defects are created with a 6 mm biopsy punch two defects are placed lateral to the vertical arms of the H flap non ischemic area two defects are placed at the edge of the cranial flap severely ischemic area and two defects are placed at the edge of the caudal flap mildly ischemic area . The duration of the study was 10 days.

Each animal was weighed prior to being anesthetized and at necropsy. The rats were anesthetized with either isofluorane via face mask or an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride 60 mg kg and xylazine 10 mg kg .

After induction of anesthesia the entire back of the animal from the dorsal cervical area to the dorsal lumbosacral area was clipped free of hair using electric animal clippers. The area was then scrubbed with chlorhexidine diacetate rinsed with alcohol dried and painted with an aqueous iodophor solution of 1 available iodine. Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes to prevent drying of the tissue during the anesthetic period. The anesthetized and surgically prepared animal was placed in the desired recumbent position.

An eccentric H flap was created by making two skin incisions parallel to the dorsal midline. The skin was separated from the body and a silicone sheet was place underneath the flap. Four stay sutures were used to tack the corners of the silicone sheet in place. The skin was repositioned in the anatomical position. The horizontal incision was sutured at several points along that incision line. Skin staples were used to close the longitudinal skin incisions. Four full thickness excisional wounds were created in two rows parallel to the midline via biopsy punch. Two additional defects were created lateral to the vertical arms of the flap. Four of the wounds were ischemic and two had normal blood flow. Test materials in the form of 6 mm disks were immediately applied to each wound site according to the designated treatment scheme. Each wound site was covered with NuGel or another similar dressing. Tincture of benzoin was painted around the periphery of the surgical site to secure the outer covering of Bioclusive.

Each animal was observed daily after surgery as directed by the Study Director or attending veterinarian to determine its health status on the basis of general attitude and appearance food consumption fecal and urinary excretion and presence of abnormal discharges. All animals were observed BID twice daily for the first three days after surgery for the presence of pain and or discomfort and given analgesics as indicated by the study director and or attending veterinarian by appropriately trained LAR personnel. Analgesics were given for 3 days starting prior to creation of the defect. Assessment for pain and distress were based on the following Evaluation of Pain attempting to protect move away or bite crying out when palpated or forced to use affected areas licking biting scratching shaking or rubbing pacing lying down and getting up or shifting weight significant decrease in mobility unusual length of time for recumbency reluctance to move or difficulty in rising and head down tucked abdomen hunched facial distortion or pallor. BID observations and treatments continued until the animals were judged to be pain free. If analgesics were given subsequent evaluations for pain and the need for re medication were based on the duration of action of the analgesics used e.g. animals were evaluated every 10 to 12 hours for drugs requiring twice daily administration. Any animal demonstrating signs of severe pain was euthanized immediately. No animals involved in this study showed signs of pain.

Rats were euthanized at day 10 by COinhalation. Gross observations of the implanted sites were recorded. The subcutaneous implantation sites with their overlying skin were excised and preserved in 10 buffered formalin fixative. Following fixation each implant was marked and trimmed. These specimens were processed for paraffin embedding then sectioned and stained with H E and Masson s Trichrome. Histologic evaluation included assessment of the tissue reaction to the scaffold and bioactive.

The ischemic rat model implantation scheme included control sites L1 and R2 with normal perfusion mildly ischemic sites L2 and R1 and highly ischemic sites L3 and R3.

Increased re epithelialization rate was not observed in 90 10 PGA PLA nonwoven lysate treated wounds as compared to saline controls. This is expected because the retention time of mesh selected for this study as a representative synthetic biomaterial delivery device which is considerably thick compared to rat skin is greater than 14 days and therefore would slow superficial wound closure and re epithelialization.

A greater than two fold increase in the angiogenic response in the biomaterials treated with 150 micrograms UDC lysate scaffold was seen when compared to the saline control group.

Increased angiogenesis was observed in wounds treated with biomaterial scaffolds containing UDC lysate compared to saline control with greater than two fold increase in the angiogenic response in the biomaterials treated with 150 micrograms UDC lysate scaffold when compared to the saline control group. This parameter would be of most critical importance in the healing of an ischemic wound site. The granulation tissue of the 90 10 PGA PLA non woven scaffold containing UDC lysate ranged form high cellularity and fibroplasia with minimal organization to moderate cellularity good organization and matrix accumulation. A mixed reaction with monocytes and neutrophils was also noted with the UDC lysate biomaterials. As expected in this study increased re epithelialization rate was not observed in 90 10 PGA PLA nonwoven lysate treated wounds as compared to saline controls. This is expected because in rat wound healing re epithelialization is partially facilitated by cutaneous contraction. The retention time of 90 10 PGA PLA non woven scaffold selected for this study as a representative synthetic biomaterial delivery device is greater than 10 days and therefore would impede cutaneous contraction. This impedance would be exhibited as slow superficial wound closure and re epithelialization.

These results demonstrate the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a synthetic biomaterial in a rat full thickness excisional ischemic wound healing model.

Diabetic foot ulcers are the most prevalent type of non healing chronic wounds. The db db mouse is a strain of diabetic mice recognized for delay in wound healing making this animal model a valuable tool in which to study chronic wounds.

The present study evaluated the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto a synthetic biomaterial in a db db mouse full thickness excisional wound healing model. In this study UDCs were expanded in culture harvested lysed by repeated freeze thaw cycles applied to 90 10 PGA PLA knitted mesh at two protein concentrations 30 micrograms and 150 micrograms total protein per mesh and lyophilized. A knitted mesh was chosen for use in this study because the thickness 200 microns is comparable to the thickness of thickness of db db mouse dermis 800 microns . The lyophilized meshes were applied to full thickness excisional wounds created in db db mice. Positive control db db mice were treated with collagen ORC and negative control db db mice were treated with saline. Blood glucose levels were obtained at day zero and day 14 to confirm diabetes. The study was completed on day 14 and the wounds were processed for histology.

Histological evaluation of the wounds treated with meshes containing lysate at both concentrations showed increases in granulation tissue area and granulation tissue depth as compared to saline control. Increased granulation tissue is essential to permanent wound healing without recurrence since it is presumed that wounds which contain greater amounts of extracellular matrix would have enhanced durability. The results demonstrate the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a synthetic biomaterial in a db db mouse full thickness dermal wound healing model.

Umbilical cords were obtained from The National Disease Research Interchange Philadelphia Pa. for research purposes with full patient consent. Cell isolation and culture were performed as described in International Patent Publication WO2005 00331482.

Human UDC lysate was produced as set forth in Example 22. The cell lysate was applied to tested materials at 30 micrograms or 150 micrograms total protein per individual sample.

Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the ramping program set forth in Example 17. All steps had a ramping rate of 2.5 C. minute and a 100 mT vacuum.

40 female diabetic mice C57BLKs Bom db db B M Denmark together with 8 female non diabetic littermates C57BLKs Bom db B M Denmark aged approximately 16 weeks were used in this study. Mice were housed in groups of 5 to 10. On the first day of the study period animals were housed in individual cages cage dimensions 35 15 15 cm with sawdust bedding changed twice weekly in an environment maintained at an ambient temperature of 23 C. with 12 hour light dark cycles. They were provided with food and water ad libitum. To acclimate the animals to their surroundings prior to experimentation they were housed for a minimum of one week without disturbance other than to refresh their bedding and to replenish their food and water provisions. Following wounding animals were monitored until they recovered from the procedure and then housed in individual cages for the remainder of the study period.

Prior to anesthesia each animal s glucose level was obtained via tail nick. The blood sample was analyzed with a glucometer. Animals were anesthetized halothane and air and shaved. A single standardized full thickness wound 7.5 mm 7.5 mm was created in the flank skin of each experimental animal. Wounds received one of the treatments described below Experimental Groups . Treatments were applied directly to the surface of wounds no pre wetting required prior to application . All materials were applied as 6.0 mm diameter discs one disc applied to each wound.

All wounds were secondarily dressed with a 1.5 1.5 cm pad of RELEASE Johnson Johnson UK moistened with a fixed volume of sterile saline excess moisture was squeezed out . The RELEASE pad was held in place using a circumferential band of the occlusive film dressing BIOCLUSIVE Johnson Johnson . All animals were re anesthetized and wounds redressed standard secondary redressing on post wounding days 4 7 and 10. Wounds allocated to Collagen ORC group had this material reapplied on post wounding days 4 7 and 10. Immediately after wounding and subsequently on days 4 7 10 and 14 all wounds were digitally photographed together with a calibration identity plate. On day 14 of the study animals were euthanized. Animals 1 2 24 27 33 and 40 died during the course of the study.

Prior to euthanasia the blood glucose level of each animal was measured from tail nick samples. All animals were painlessly euthanized using COasphyxiation confirmed by cervical dislocation on day 14 post wounding. Wounds with surrounding normal tissue were excised and subsequently fixed in 10 formalin for routine histological assessment. Excised tissue was sandwiched between two pieces of filter paper prior to being placed in fixative to reduce the extent of tissue curling. Fixed specimens were trimmed and bisected generating two half wounds per site. Both halves were processed and embedded in paraffin wax. Specimens too small to bisect were embedded whole. Specimens were oriented in such a fashion as to ensure that appropriate transverse sections of the wound were taken. Wax embedded tissue was sectioned 7 microns and representative sections stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin H E .

The following evaluations were undertaken on representative H E sections of each wound image analysis based quantitative assessment of wound re epithelialization and granulation tissue deposition.

Non parametric analysis Kruskal Wallace Multivariate Analysis followed by ad hoc two sample Mann Whitney U test analysis was used to test the significance of any inter group differences in re epithelialisation wound width and granulation tissue deposition.

Values for wound width granulation tissue area and percent re epithelialization are means of three measurements taken from three representative sections. Values for granulation tissue depth are means of 15 measurements 5 from each of three representative sections.

Histological evaluation of the wounds treated with meshes containing UDC lysate showed increases in granulation tissue area and granulation tissue depth as compared to saline control. The db db 90 10 PGA PLA knitted mesh 150 microgram treatment group showed a significant increase in granulation tissue area versus db db saline and p 0.006 t test as well as a near significant increase in granulation tissue depth versus db db control p 0.06 t test . Increased granulation tissue is essential to permanent wound healing and reduced incidence of wound recurrence. Decreased wound width and increased re epithelialization was not observed in lysate treated wounds as compared to saline controls. This is expected because the retention time of mesh selected for this study as a representative synthetic biomaterial delivery device with a thickness compatible with db db mouse skin is greater than 14 days and therefore would slow superficial wound closure and re epithelialization. Despite the physical presence of this structure 75 91 of these wounds closed within the 14 day study. These results demonstrate the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto a synthetic biomaterial in a db db mouse full thickness wound healing model.

PPDC lysate has been evaluated in several in vivo models previously. Two acute models have been used a rat subcutaneous implant model and a full thickness excisional swine model. These studies demonstrated that cell lysate has a good biocompatibility profile yields increased extracellular matrix formation in the rat subcutaneous implant model Examples 18 and 19 and results in increased extracellular matrix deposition at early timepoints in the pig with a concomitant increase in inflammation which is not present at day 14 Examples 21 and 22 . Additionally PPDC lysate has been evaluated in two delayed healing models an ischemic rat model Example 23 and in a full thickness excisional wound model in db db mice Example 24 . In the ischemic rat model a greater than two fold increase in angiogenesis was observed in wounds treated with biomaterials containing PPDC lysate compared to saline control. In the previous db db model although wound closure was not achieved due to the nonresorbable scaffold material bridging the wound open enhanced granulation tissue formation was seen in the cell lysate groups.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological effect of UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a natural scaffold consisting of collagen ORC in a recognized model of delayed healing the db db mouse wound healing model. The primary endpoint considered in this evaluation was the effect of this material on the increase in the healing rate time to complete wound closure in this impaired model since this is the key requirement set forth from the FDA Guidance for Industry for Development of Products for Treatment of Cutaneous Ulcers. Qualitative and semi quantitative measurements of granulation tissue and inflammatory response were also assessed.

Quantitative analysis of clinical wound images showed that at days 7 10 and 14 Collagen ORC scaffolds containing 90 micrograms PPDC lysate protein demonstrated statistically significant greater wound closure than the Collagen ORC scaffold alone. In addition at day 14 Collagen ORC containing 30 micrograms cell lysate protein demonstrated statistically significant greater wound closure than Collagen ORC p

A single 7.5 mm 7.5 mm full thickness excisional wound was created on the left side of homozygous db db mice and on heterozygous control mice. 56 mice were evaluated for 14 days.

The treatments were implanted at the time of surgery and left in place throughout the study period. The treatments approx. 1 1 cm were placed in the wound and covered with wound dressing pads sold under the tradename RELEASE Johnson Johnson New Brunswick N.J. . The RELEASE pad was dipped into sterile saline and excess fluid was squeezed out prior to placing it on the animal. All wounds were then covered with transparent wound Dressing sold under the tradename BIOCLUSIVE Johnson Johnson New Brunswick N.J. .

Digital images of each wound were taken at days 0 4 7 10 and 14 post wounding. These images were used to evaluate wound closure over time.

Bandage changes were done on days 4 7 and 10 of the study. Additional bandage changes were done if an animal escaped its bandage prior to a scheduled change.

Tissues were harvested from the animals on day 14. The entire wound and surrounding normal skin was excised and placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin. The cranial half of the excised tissue was sent for histological processing paraffin sections and stained with H E and Masson s trichrome. The caudal portion of each sample was retained for possible future analysis.

Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for inflammatory response and quality of repair. Measurements of granulation tissue area and epithelial tongue length were also made.

Wound dressings sold under the tradename PROMOGRAN Johnson Johnson New Brunswick N.J. Lot 1305263 was stored at room temperature prior to manipulation for this study. Cell lysate CL was aseptically applied to the scaffolds and then lyophilized under aseptic conditions. Scaffolds containing no CL were also lyophilized. The processed PROMOGRAN samples will be referred to as ORC Collagen.

Human UDC lysate supernatant was prepared as in Example 22. The total protein content of the collected supernatant fluid was assessed by Bradford assay and the dose volume of supernatant fluid 30 micrograms total protein per material or 90 micrograms total protein per material was calculated. The dose volume of supernatant fluid was applied to the material as five one fifth total dose volume aliquots. An aliquot was placed at each corner of the 1.5 1.5 cm material approximately 1 mm from the material edge and one aliquot was placed in the center of the material. This ensured even distribution of lysate within the wound bed.

Test materials with applied lysate were loaded into a FTS Systems Dura Stop MP Stoppering Tray Dryer and lyophilized using the ramping program set forth in Example 17. All steps had a ramping rate of 2.5 C. minute and a 100 mT vacuum.

Each animal was weighed and tested for blood glucose level prior to anesthesia. Induction of anesthesia was accomplished by placing each mouse into a pre charged Isoflurane anesthesia chamber. Once anesthetized the animal was placed on a nose cone to maintain the surgical plane of anesthesia. Eye ointment was applied to each animal to prevent corneal ulceration. No analgesics were administered due to the db db mouse s physiology. Each animal was carefully scrutinized to determine if they were experiencing pain. Analgesics would have been administered if signs had been demonstrated.

Skin depilation from the back shoulder side and flank regions was accomplished with an electric animal clipper. The area was vacuumed to remove hair clippings and stratum corneum debris. Each animal was wiped with Betadine and alcohol prior to being placed on the surgical table.

Full thickness excisional wounds 7.5 7.5 mm were created on the left side of each animal with a scalpel and scissors. Each wound was submitted to a treatment regimen. The scaffolds were placed into the wound bed. CL treated scaffolds were placed top side down.

The test materials were undisturbed for the length of the study. The wounds were covered with an approximate 1 1 cm square of RELEASE. The RELEASE was dipped in sterile saline and the excess fluid was squeezed out prior to application. The wounds were further dressed with BIOCLUSIVE to keep the wounds moist and to keep the test articles and RELEASE in place.

The secondary bandages RELEASE and BIOCLUSIVE were changed on days 4 7 and 10 of the study. Care was taken to ensure that the wound was not disturbed during the dressing changes. Additional bandage changes were performed if an animal escaped it bandages prior to a scheduled change.

After recovering from surgery and general anesthesia each mouse was observed for behavioral signs of discomfort or pain. No signs of discomfort or pain were observed. Animals were returned to their cage when fully conscious and ambulatory.

The health status of each mouse was determined by general appearance and attitude food consumption fecal and urinary excretion the presence of abnormal discharges and bandage integrity. Each mouse was observed twice daily during the first 36 hours following surgery. Following recovery from surgery the observations were reduced to once daily until the end of the study.

At the predetermined time point 7 and 14 days post wounding the animals were euthanized via carbon dioxide. The animals were observed to ensure that respiratory function had ceased and there was no palpable cardiac function.

Immediately following euthanasia each wound along with the underlying fat and margin of surrounding skin was excised. The wound was bisected into cranial and caudal halves. The cranial half of the wound was fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin processed and embedded in paraffin. Samples were sectioned at 5 microns and stained for H E and Masson s trichrome by MPI Research. The caudal half of the wound was fixed in 10 neutral buffer formalin and is reserved for any future analysis.

Digital images were taken of individual wounds on days 0 4 7 10 and 14 post wounding. These images were used to measure wound closure. Using Image Pro 4.0 Image Analysis software each image was calibrated using the ruler label included in the photo. The wound was traced to determine the area that remained open. Day 0 images were used as baseline and the percentage remaining open was calculated based on the day being evaluated versus the area of that wound on day 0.

A computer controlled motorized programmable slide scanning system was used in the process of image acquisition. Separate images of high magnification fields were acquired from a microscope. The images were tiled to preserve the integrity of the entire histological specimen. This allows accurate measurement of the entire tissue sample.

Images from the light microscope were captured into the computer memory via CCD camera and frame grabber board and subsequently analyzed using Image Pro 4.0 Image Analysis software.

Histological assessments were performed by a consulting pathologist. Tissue sections were histologically analyzed for the presence of the scaffold granulation tissue quality and inflammatory response.

Treatments were assigned in a blocked fashion. Visual assessments were analyzed using JMP 4.0.4 software. Shapiro Wilk W Test was performed prior to data analysis to determine normality. Nominal and Ordinal data was analyzed using Chi Square. Continuous data was analyzed using One way ANOVA. Tukey Kramer or Student Newman Keuls SNK test for multiple comparisons was performed to determine differences between groups following One way ANOVA. A value of p

Some differences between the diabetic groups were seen in blood glucose level however all db db mice were sufficiently diabetic during the course of the study.

On each day of bandage change and at the time of necropsy each animal was evaluated. Any unique observations were noted. Table 25 1 summarizes the findings.

Quantitative analysis of clinical wound images Table 25 2 shows that at days 7 10 and 14 Collagen ORC scaffolds containing 90 micrograms cell lysate protein demonstrated statistically significant greater wound closure than the Collagen ORC scaffold alone.

These results demonstrate the ability of UDC lysate lyophilized onto and released from a natural biomaterial of collagen ORC to increase the rate of closure in a db db mouse full thickness wound healing model.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of PPDCs PPDC products and recombinant human growth factors following their loading on bioresorbable scaffolds and implantation in SCID mice in meniscal avascular repair. UDCs and human fibroblasts at passage 10 11 were evaluated in this study. UDC conditioned medium and cell lysates obtained from umbilicus derived cells and human fibroblasts also were evaluated in this study. Also included in this study were recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF and recombinant human platelet derived growth factor BB PDGF BB . The utility of these treatments was assessed following cell seeding or loading of the growth factor and cell derivatives on scaffolds. Treatments were placed between two discs made from the avascular region of the bovine meniscus. Constructs were held together with fibrin glue and implanted into SCID mice. Scaffolds without cells or growth factor were also implanted into SCID mice as controls.

Results showed that repair tissue filled the synthetic bioresorbable scaffolds without growth factor and cells or cell derivatives. Repair tissue appeared to be fibrous with collagen matrix that stained positive with trichrome but did not stain positive with Safranin O. No striking differences were observed in scaffolds containing cells cell derivatives or the growth factors bFGF and PDGF BB in terms of the quality of repair tissue and intensity of the matrix staining with trichrome compared to scaffold alone at the cell densities and growth factor concentrations tested. Also no positive staining was observed with Safranin O in these samples. Marginal differences in intensity of trichrome staining were noted in scaffolds loaded with conditioned medium derived from umbilicus derived cells compared to scaffolds loaded with medium alone. Scaffolds loaded with 100 ng of bFGF showed marginally higher intensity of staining with trichrome than scaffolds loaded with 10 ng of bFGF.

New repair tissue formation was observed in the majority of the 50 50 Polyglactin 910 Polydioxanone 50 50 PDS VNW samples including scaffold alone scaffolds loaded with growth factor cell seeded scaffolds and cell derivative loaded scaffolds. The repair tissue was predominantly fibrous in nature and stained positive with trichrome. Collagen fiber bundles were observed in most cases.

50 50 PDS VNW scaffolds loaded with cells lysates or conditioned medium at the concentrations tested did not appear to be strikingly different than control scaffolds. Scaffolds loaded with cells as expected appeared to be more cellular than control scaffolds. A marginal increase in intensity of trichrome staining was noted in scaffolds loaded with UDC CM when compared to scaffolds loaded with control medium.

50 50 PDS VNW scaffolds loaded with 100 ng bFGF showed marginally higher intensity of staining with trichrome than scaffolds loaded with 10 ng of bFGF. No striking differences were noted between the scaffolds treated with 10 ng and 100 ng of PDGF BB.

DURAFORM Collagen control scaffolds were not observed in any of the samples indicating that they may have been resorbed before cells could migrate into and lay down new matrix.

Expanded hUDCs are being developed as a potential cell therapy for the treatment of a number of degenerative diseases. One of the mechanisms of action by which these cells can act is through trophic factor support. Trophic factors are the proteins and other materials such as lipids and glycosaminoglycans that cells produce to stimulate a biological effect. It is speculated that hUDC trophic factors could be beneficial in the treatment of a number of diseases including chronic wounds.

To assess the potency of hUDC lysate increasing concentrations were dissolved in culture medium and applied to mouse fibroblasts and human endothelial cells. The increases in proliferation above basal media indicate lysate potency.

Expanded hUDCs are being developed as a potential cell therapy for the treatment of a number of degenerative diseases. In addition the proteins and other materials cells produce referred to as trophic factors can be used as bioactives to augment cellular response.

A process has been developed to generate lysate from human umbilical tissue derived cells. To characterize potency lysate was assayed for the ability to stimulate proliferation of either mouse fibroblast or human endothelial cells. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells are known to be key cell types involved in a wound healing response.

hUDC lysate increased proliferation of mouse fibroblasts NIH 3T3 and human endothelial cells at all concentrations tested. For both cell types the highest concentration of cell lysate stimulated proliferation above the level of complete growth media containing 10 serum. This assay system can be utilized for testing biological activity of lysate.
