title: Magazine feed lips gauge
abstract: An apparatus for testing a clearance between feed lips of an ammunition magazine includes a generally T-shaped member including a support portion and a measuring portion that is generally perpendicular to the support portion; the measuring portion including first and second surfaces, the first surface having a width that is less than the clearance between the feed lips and the second surface having a width that is greater than the clearance between the feed lips.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The present invention relates in general to ammunition magazines and in particular to a test gauge for determining whether an ammunition magazine is operable.

Ammunition magazines for example a thirty round magazine may include feed lips that aid in chambering rounds of ammunition into a firearm chamber. Known magazines have an undetermined life expectancy and very few preventative features exist to avoid issuing magazines that are prone to stoppage and or malfunction. While the problem has existed for many years it has become increasingly visible due to the massive deployment of soldiers into theater and the present backorder of new magazines. There is a demand for critical inspection methods for used magazines that will enable reissue without the risk of weapon stoppages. Many other critical elements of small caliber weapons are gauged on a regular basis to ensure reliability of the weapon and survivability of the soldier.

To determine if magazine feed lips are within operational tolerances the known method is a visual inspection. Many times a magazine is discarded only after a history of malfunctions. This is unsatisfactory due to the large number of magazines in use that may be prone to malfunctions. Therefore there is a need for a reliable method of testing the feed lips of an ammunition magazine to determine if the feed lips are within tolerance.

It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus for determining if the feed lips of an ammunition magazine are within tolerances.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus for testing the clearance between feed lips of an ammunition magazine comprising a generally T shaped member including a support portion and a measuring portion that is generally perpendicular to the support portion the measuring portion including first and second surfaces the first surface having a width that is less than the clearance between the feed lips and the second surface having a width that is greater than the clearance between the feed lips.

Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus for testing a clearance between feed lips of an ammunition magazine the feed lips having a length and the magazine having a raised contour comprising a generally T shaped member including a support portion and a measuring portion that is generally perpendicular to the support portion the support portion including channels on opposite sides configured to mate with the raised contour of the magazine the measuring portion including first and second surfaces the first surface having a width that is less than the clearance between the feed lips and the second surface having a width that is greater than the clearance between the feed lips.

A further aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising an ammunition magazine comprising feed lips and a raised contour the feed lips having a length and a clearance a generally T shaped member including a support portion and a measuring portion that is generally perpendicular to the support portion the support portion including channels on opposite sides one of the channels engaging the raised contour of the magazine the measuring portion including first and second surfaces the first surface having a width that is less than the clearance between the feed lips and the second surface having a width that is greater than the clearance between the feed lips.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The magazine feed lips gauge of the present invention is generally in the shape of a T . The gauge may be machined in one piece from for example one tool steel type A2 or stainless steel. The material and method of construction should be similar to existing gauges such as the Firing Pin Protrusion Gauge used on the M16 and M4 Carbine. The magazine feed lips gauge is intended to check the minimum and maximum allowable clearance tolerances of magazine feed lips using a simple go no go concept.

Channels of the support portion of the gauge are configured to mate with the raised contour of the magazine . The width a of the first surface of the measuring portion is less than the design clearance c between the feed lips . The width b of the second surface of the measuring portion is greater than the design clearance c between the feed lips . The length e of the first surface and the length f of the second surface are at least as long as the length d of the feed lips .

Both channels are identical to thereby allow either the maximum or minimum tolerance to be evaluated by simply rotating the gauge 180 degrees. The first surface i.e. the minimum or GO side of the gauge should slide down into the magazine without coming into contact with the feed lips . The second surface i.e. the maximum or NO GO side of the gauge should be prevented from entering into the magazine by the feed lips . The widths and lengths of the first and second surfaces of the gauge will vary depending on the particular magazine being tested. The widths of the first and second surfaces are associated with the tolerances of the feed lips referenced from datum planes included in the engineering drawings for a particular magazine .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
