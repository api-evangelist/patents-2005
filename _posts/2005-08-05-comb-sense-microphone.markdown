title: Comb sense microphone
abstract: There is provided a rigid hinged substrate, which forms a diaphragm for miniature microphones. A series of fingers disposed radially around the perimeter of the diaphragm interacts with mating fingers disposed adjacent the diaphragm with a small gap in between. The fingers are interdigitated. The movement of the diaphragm fingers relative to the fixed fingers varies the capacitance, thereby allowing creation of an electrical signal responsive to varying sound pressure at the diaphragm. Because the fingers may be formed with great stiffness, the classic problem in typical capacitive microphones of attraction of the diaphragm to the back plate is effectively overcome. The multiple fingers allow the creation of a microphone having a high output voltage relative to conventional microphones. This yields a very low noise microphone. The diaphragm may be readily formed using well known silicon microfabrication techniques so as to reduce manufacturing costs.

The invention pertains to capacitive microphones and more particularly to capacitive microphones having rigid silicon diaphragms with a plurality of fingers interdigitated and interacting with corresponding fingers of an adjacent fixed frame.

A common approach for transducing the motion of a microphone diaphragm into an electronic signal is to construct a parallel plate capacitor where a fixed electrode usually called a back plate is placed in close proximity to a flexible i.e. movable microphone diaphragm. As the flexible diaphragm moves relative to the back plate in response to varying sound pressure the capacitance of the microphone varies. This variation in capacitance may be translated to an electrical signal using a number of well known techniques. One such method is shown in which is a schematic diagram of a typical capacitor condenser microphone of the prior art. A fixed back plate is spaced apart a distance d from a flexible diaphragm . A DC bias voltage Vb is applied across back plate and diaphragm .

An amplifier has an input electrically connected to diaphragm so as to produce an output voltage Vo in response to movement of diaphragm relative to back plate . Because the output signal Vo is proportional to bias voltage Vb it is desirable to make Vb as high as possible so as to maximize output signal voltage Vo of microphone .

Unfortunately the bias voltage Vb exerts an electrostatic force on diaphragm in the direction of the back plate. This limits the practical upper limit of the bias voltage Vb. This electrostatic force f is given by the equation 

It will be noted that regardless of the polarity of Vb this electrostatic force f acts to pull diaphragm towards back plate . If Vb is increased beyond a certain magnitude diaphragm collapses against back plate . In order to avoid this collapse the diaphragm must be designed to have sufficient stiffness. Unfortunately this requirement for diaphragm stiffness conflicts with the need for high diaphragm compliance necessary to ensure responsiveness to sound pressure.

Because in microphones of this construction electrostatic force f does not vary linearly with x distortion of the output signal relative to the sensed acoustic pressure typically results.

Yet another problem occurs in these types of microphones. The presence of back plate typically causes excessive viscous damping of the diaphragm . This damping is caused by the squeezing of the air in the narrow gap separating the back plate and the diaphragm .

The comb sense microphone of the present invention overcomes all of these shortcomings of microphones of the prior art.

In accordance with the present invention there is provided an ultra miniature microphone incorporating a rigid silicon resiliently supported substrate which forms a diaphragm. A series of fingers disposed around the perimeter of the diaphragm interacts with mating fingers disposed adjacent the diaphragm fingers with a small gap in between. In other words the fingers are interdigitated. The movement of the diaphragm fingers relative to the fixed fingers varies the capacitance thereby allowing creation of an electrical signal responsive to a varying sound pressure at the diaphragm. Because the electrostatic force on the fingers does not have a significant dependence on the out of plane displacement of the diaphragm the classic problem of attraction of the diaphragm to the back plate discussed hereinabove is effectively overcome. The diaphragm can be designed to be very compliant without creating instabilities due to electrostatic forces. The multiple fingers allow creation of a microphone having a high output voltage relative to microphones of the prior art. This in turn allows creation of very low noise microphones.

The diaphragm is readily formed using well known silicon microfabrication techniques to yield low manufacturing costs.

It should be noted that many capacitive sensors utilize interdigitated comb fingers. The primary uses of this sensing approach are in silicon accelerometers and gyroscopes well known to those of skill in those arts. Such sensors generally consist of a resiliently supported proof mass that moves relative to the surrounding substrate due to the motion of the substrate. An essential feature of these constructions is that the proof mass is supported only on a small fraction of its perimeter allowing a significant portion of the perimeter to be available for capacitive detection of the relative motion of the proof mass and the surrounding substrate through the use of comb fingers. This requirement has precluded the use of comb fingers for capacitive sensing in microphones because the typical approach to the formation of a microphone diaphragm is to construct a very thin plate that is effectively clamped along its entire perimeter. Because silicon accelerometers and gyroscopes utilize compliant hinges rather than entirely clamped perimeters they readily permit the use of comb fingers for sensing.

A highly efficient capacitance microphone that overcomes the deficiencies of classic capacitance microphones of the prior art described hereinabove may be formed by making a diaphragm having a series of fingers disposed around its perimeter. These fingers are then interdigitated with corresponding fingers on a fixed structure analogous to a back plate in microphone .

Referring now to there is shown a schematic cross sectional view of an interdigitated finger structure generally at reference number . A series of fingers projects from the surface of a substrate . The surface of substrate is free to move out of the plane of the figure and forms the diaphragm of a microphone. Additional fingers project from the surface of a fixed structure representative of a microphone back plate. Fingers projecting from diaphragm are free to move with the diaphragm out of the plane of the figure as well as in the direction x indicated by arrow relative to the fixed structure .

Referring now also to there is shown an end view of a portion of the fingers of showing one each of fingers . Fingers and are separated by a gap d . Fingers and may overlap one another a distance h .

Each finger has a length l not shown in a direction perpendicular to the cross sectional view of . The length l of each finger depends on several factors such as the available area of the diaphragm and on other practical fabrication considerations.

The total capacitance C of a microphone structure using the interdigitation technique of and may be roughly estimated by 

If a bias voltage Vb is then applied between diaphragm and back plate Equations 1 and 4 show the resulting electrostatic force f to be 

Equation 5 clearly shows that the nonlinear dependence of f on x Equation 3 for the parallel plate microphone of the prior art no longer exists. Consequently bias voltage Vb has only a minimal effect on the dynamic response of the interdigitated diaphragm and does not affect the stability of the diaphragm s motion in the x direction a significantly higher bias voltage Vb may be used without a need to increase diaphragm stiffness resulting in increased microphone sensitivity without the diaphragm collapse problems of prior art microphones.

One possible way to obtain an electrical signal from a capacitive microphone is shown in the circuit of generally at reference number . A capacitive microphone has a bias voltage Vb applied to one electrical connection thereof. The second electrical connection of microphone is connected to the negative input of an operational amplifier the input of operational amplifier being connected to ground. A feedback capacitor Cf is connected between the output of amplifier and the input thereof. Because C may be expressed by Equation 4 the output voltage Vo of amplifier is 

If microphone is fabricated in silicon then reasonable parameters for microphone may be l approximately 100 m d 1 m h 5 m and N 100. The diaphragm is assumed to deflect approximately 20 nM for every 1 Pascal sound pressure. Assuming a feedback capacitor of approximately 1.5 pf the output voltage Vo will be 0.0043 volts Pascal. 8 

Using a bias voltage Vb of 10 volts provides an output sensitivity of approximately 43 mV Pascal. It will be recognized that if the inter finger gap d is reduced to approximately 0.1 m a value that is obtainable using currently known silicon microfabrication techniques then the output voltage Vo may be increased by a factor of 10. In other words the voltage Vb may be reduced to 1 volt and with the 0.1 m gaps the same 43 mv Pascal output sensitivity may be obtained.

It should be noted that while a significant advantage of this invention is that the bias voltage does not affect the dynamic response of the diaphragm in the x direction one must still be careful to design the fingers so that they have sufficient stiffness to avoid the situation where the neutral position of the fingers is made to be unstable by the use of too large a value of Vb. In this case the fingers may deflect such that they touch each other and reduce the performance of the capacitive sensing system. However it is important to emphasize that the design requirements for the stiffness of the fingers are uncoupled from the requirements that determine the compliance of the diaphragm it is desirable to use stiff fingers along with a diaphragm that is very compliant in the x direction so that the diaphragm is highly responsive to sound.

In addition to considering the effect of the electrostatic forces on the stability of the fingers it is not possible to use an arbitrarily large bias voltage because the finite break down voltage of the air in the gap between the fingers may allow current to flow across the gap which would have a dramatic affect on the electronic signal.

Referring now to there is shown a schematic representation of a typical diaphragm in accordance with the present invention. Diaphragm has a number of fingers N disposed in a finger region at one end of the diaphragm. Assuming a period of approximately 3 m the number N of fingers which may be placed at each end of the diaphragm may be estimated as 

A practical microphone diaphragm in accordance with the inventive concepts may be microfabricated in polysilicon.

Referring now to there is shown a plan schematic view of a diaphragm in accordance with the present invention suitable for use in an omnidirectional microphone generally at reference number . A rigid silicon diaphragm has stiffening ribs disposed on a least one face thereof. Diaphragm is free to rotate about a pivot or hinge . Such a diaphragm is described in detail in application Ser. No. 10 302 528 which is included herein by reference. In alternate embodiments diaphragm may be resiliently supported by mechanisms other than a hinge or pivot . For example diaphragm could be supported by one or more springs or other resilient structures not shown at or near corners of diaphragm . Such springs could support diaphragm from below in compression or could support diaphragm from above in tension. In yet other embodiments diaphragm could be supported on a resilient pad e.g. a foam pad . The inventive diaphragm with its interdigitated finger structure is not intended to be limited to a particular support structure or method but is seen to include any means for resiliently supporting diaphragm .

A series of sensing fingers is disposed radially around a portion on the perimeter of diaphragm . Fingers have been described hereinabove. Fingers are adapted for interdigitation with corresponding fingers not shown on a surrounding fixed frame not shown.

It will be recognized that radial disposition of the fingers eliminates potential interference between the diaphragm fingers and the interdigitated fingers on a surrounding substrate not shown caused by strain in the diaphragm . If a diaphragm can be fabricated and supported in a manner wherein strain is effectively eliminated finger arrangements other than radial disposition may also be used. Consequently the inventive concept is not limited to radial finger disposition but is seen to encompass any interdigitated finger arrangement.

It will be recognized that all fingers are disposed radially from respective geometric centers of diaphragms such that as each diaphragm moves in response to in plane stresses and strains that occur during fabrication not shown fingers each move in substantially a single plane relative to their corresponding fixed fingers. The radial arrangement of the fingers prevents them from getting stuck together when the diaphragm shrinks or expands during fabrication. The fingers radiate from a point on the diaphragm that doesn t move relative to the surrounding substrate. While substantially rectangular diaphragms have been chosen for purposes of disclosure the inventive concept of radially disposed fingers may be applied to diaphragms of other shapes. Consequently the invention is not considered limited to such rectangular diaphragms chosen for purposes of disclosure but rather is seen to encompass diaphragms of any other shape. Also in the embodiments chosen for purposes of disclosure fingers are said to radiate from a geometric center of the diaphragm it will be recognized that fingers may radiate radially relative to any point on the diaphragm that remains fixed relative to the surrounding substrate with which such fingers are interdigitated. Consequently the inventive concept is not considered limited to embodiments wherein fingers radiate only from a geometric center of the diaphragm. It should also be noted that the orientation of the fingers may be determined by other considerations if the shrinkage or expansion of the diaphragm relative to the substrate is not significant relative to the distance between the fingers.

In a typical realization of a microphone in accordance with the present invention fingers may be approximately 100 m in length and may be spaced approximately 1.0 m i.e. that have approximately a 3 m period .

While a capacitance microphone configuration has been described for purposes of disclosure it is possible to create microphones or other similar devices using sensing methods other than capacitance. For example a light source may be modulated by movement of the diaphragm fingers and used to generate an output signal. Optical interferometry techniques may also be used to generate an output signal representative of the movement of a diaphragm by sound pressure vibration or any other actuating force acting thereupon. Consequently the inventive concept is not seen limited to capacitive sensing microphones but rather is seen to include any microphone or similar device having fingers disposed around a perimeter of diaphragm regardless of the technology used to sense diaphragm movement.

Since other modifications and changes varied to fit particular operating requirements and environments will be apparent to those skilled in the art the invention is not considered limited to the example chosen for purposes of disclosure and covers all changes and modifications which do not constitute departures from the true spirit and scope of this invention.

Having thus described the invention what is desired to be protected by Letters Patent is presented in the subsequently appended claims.
