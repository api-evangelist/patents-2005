title: System and method for playing call indications for telecommunications systems at least partially implemented in computer file access networks
abstract: This invention is especially intended for playing Ring Tones (referred to hereinbelow as “RT's”) on a called computer terminal, and/or Ring Back Tones (referred to hereinbelow as “RBT's”) on the calling computer terminal, in voice communications selected from users of different computer terminals, mainly personal computers (referred to hereinbelow as “PC's”) by means of a network which is at least partially a data network capable of supporting voice, such as the Internet. RT's and/or RBT's are played by means of a continuous download of said tones (referred to hereinbelow as “streaming”) given that neither RT nor RBT are present at any time on any of the PC's, but rather are downloaded from a remote server where RT's and/or RBT's are located. In general, the user of the called PC will be the one determining what RT and/or RBT will be played in terms of the different optional factors such as which calling PC is involved.

The present application claims priority from Spanish Application Serial No. P200501159 filed on May 13 2005. Applicants claim priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 as to the said Spanish application and the entire disclosure of said application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Systems and Methods for playing Ring Back Tones RBT s on a calling mobile phone voice communications between conventional telephony users by means of a conventional fixed or mobile telephone network without access to computer file access networks such as the Internet currently alqueryy exist. In addition thereto said RBT s were played by having to store the RBT which is going to be heard on the calling telephone terminal previously in the called telephone terminal.

However there is no record of the existence to date of this being done selected from computer terminals mainly personal computers for voice communications selected from users of said computer terminals by means of a network which is at least partially a data network affording the possibility of supporting voice such as the Internet. Likewise there is no record of said RBT s being played to date on the communications terminal by means of streaming of said tones avoiding both technically and commercially advantageous said RBT s from having to be present on any of said computer terminals. Likewise there is no record to date of the Ring Tones RT s being played by means of this same continuous download streaming method.

A first object of the invention is a System provided with means for playing Ring Tones RT s on a called computer terminal and or Ring Back Tones RBT s on the calling computer terminal in voice communications between users of computer terminals mainly personal computers PC s by means of a network which is at least partially a data network affording the possibility of supporting voice such as the Internet. Said System is provided with means of playing RT s and RBT s by means of the continuous download streaming of said tones it therefore not being necessary at any time for the RT or the RBT to be present on any of the PC s but rather said means downloading the RT s and or RBT s off a remote server where they are resident. Optionally the System is provided with means enabling the user of the called PC to determine which RT and or RBT will be played in terms of different likewise optional factors as well as which calling PC is involved.

A second object of the invention is a Method for playing Ring Tones RT s on a called computer terminal and or Ring Back Tones RBT s on the calling computer terminal in voice communications between users of said computer terminals mainly personal computers PC s by means of a networks which is at least partially a data network capable of supporting voice such as the Internet. Said Playing Method makes it possible to play RT s and or RBT s by means of a continuous download streaming of said tones it therefore not being necessary at any time for RT or RBT to be present at any time on any of the PC s but rather they are downloaded off a remote server where said RT s and or RBT s are resident. Optionally the Method enables the user of the called PC to determine what RT and or RBT will be played in terms of different likewise optional factors such as which PC is calling.

As it is being claimed the present invention is that of a System which in the most basic embodiment thereof comprises 

According to a particular embodiment of the invention of said Call Indication Player System including the computerized ring tones are computerized call indications for called receiver terminals Ring Tones and the software application for requesting and receiving call indications is implemented as a first call indication request and reception software application which is resident in the called receiver terminal where the means for the real time reception of the computerized call indicators of said first call indication request and reception software application activate the multimedia file playback software application on the called receiver terminal in order to play directly in real time the computerized call indication received for said called receiver terminal Ring Tone which the user of the called receiver terminal has associated for said called receiver terminal without said computerized call indication for the called receiver terminal Ring Tone therefore being stored either prior to or at the time of the call in said called receiver terminal where it is played.

According to another particular embodiment of the invention of said Call Indication Player System the following is included 

According to another particular embodiment of the invention of said Call Indication Player System the following is included 

According to another particular embodiment of the invention of said Call Indication Player System includes that the call request detection means are implemented at least partially by means of at least one means of interaction with the user to user communication software application selected from 

According to another particular embodiment of the invention of said Call Indication Player System includes that the means for the real time reception of the computerized call indications and the means of interrupting the computerized call indications are implemented at least partially by means of at least one means of interacting with the multimedia file player software application selected from 

According to another particular embodiment of the invention of said Call Indication Player System including that the user to user communications software application and the multimedia file player software application are implemented in one same software application.
