The invention relates to novel substituted 3 phenylamino 5 3 aminophenyl pyridines and corresponding pyrazines processes for the preparation thereof pharmaceutical compositions containing same the use thereof optionally in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active compounds for the therapy of neoplastic diseases and autoimmune diseases and a method for the treatment of such a diseases.

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in humans. Although a variety of drugs against neoplastic diseases have been developed and techniques are available such as surgery and radiation therapy there is still a need for alternative and improved methods of treatment of neoplastic diseases.

Autoimmune diseases are associated with abnormal lymphoproliferation as a result of defects in the termination of lymphocyte activation and growth. Often such diseases are associated with inflammation like rheumatoid arthritis insulin dependent diabetes mellitus multiple sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosus and the like. The treatment of such diseases is focused on anti inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs which in numerous cases show severe side effects. Hence there is a need for alternative drugs with a new mode of action showing less side effects.

Apoptosis is a term used to describe a series of cellular events which occur to bring about programmed cell death. There are various apoptotic pathways some of which have been characterized whereas others remain to be elucidated. If the balance between cell division and apoptosis is disturbed life threatening diseases including cancer autoimmune disorders neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases may occur.

In recent years it has become evident that programmed cell death apoptosis is as important to the health of a multicellular organism as cell division. By repeated cell division and differentiation throughout development or tissue repair surplus or even harmful cells are generated. In order to maintain tissue homeostasis these cells have to be removed or killed. The delicate interplay between cell growth and apoptosis in an organism is mirrored in the complex molecular balance that determines whether an individual cell undergoes division arrests in the cell cycle or commits to programmed cell death.

Dysregulation of cell proliferation or lack of appropriate cell death has wide ranging clinical implications. A number of diseases associated with such dysregulation involve hyperproliferation inflammation tissue remodeling and repair. Familiar indications in this category include cancers restenosis neointimal hyperplasia angiogenesis endometriosis lymphoproliferative disorders transplantation related pathologies graft rejection polyposis loss of neural function in the case of tissue remodeling and the like. Such cells may lose the normal regulatory control of cell division and may also fail to undergo appropriate cell death.

As apoptosis is inhibited or delayed in most types of proliferative neoplastic diseases induction of apoptosis is an option for treatment of cancer especially in cancer types which show resistance to classic chemotherapy radiation and immunotherapy Apoptosis and Cancer Chemotherapy Hickman and Dive eds. Blackwell Publishing 1999 . Also in autoimmune and transplantation related diseases and pathologies compounds inducing apoptosis may be used to restore normal cell death processes and therefore can eradicate the symptoms and might cure the diseases. Further applications of compounds inducing apoptosis may be in restenosis i.e. accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the walls of arteries and in persistent infections caused by a failure to eradicate bacteria and virus infected cells. Furthermore apoptosis can be induced or re established in epithelial cells in endothelial cells in muscle cells and in others which have lost contact with extracellular matrix. These cells are potentially able to colonize other organs and therefore can develop into pathologies like neoplasias endometriosis and the like.

B MTS proliferation assay measuring the metabolic activity of cells. Viable cells are metabolically active whereas cells with compromised respiratory chain show a reduced activity in this test. C AnnexinV binding assay which reflects the phosphatidylserine content of the outer lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. This event is considered an early hallmark of apoptosis. D PI staining for cell cycle distribution which shows any alterations in the distribution among the different phases of the cell cycle. Cell cycle arresting points can be determined. E Proliferation assay monitoring DNA synthesis by incorporating bromodeoxyuridine BrdU . Inhibitory effects on growth proliferation can be directly determined. F Cystein proteinase dependency respectively caspase dependency are determined by using specific inhibitors. This provides information about possible involvement of specific proteases in the mechanisms.

Most preferred are the compounds of the Examples 2 to 7 and 9 to 66 especially the compounds of Examples 2 4 11 12 13 14 16 17 18 20 21 22 and 26.

A compound of the invention may be prepared by processes that though not applied hitherto for the new compounds of the present invention are known per se in particular

In method A the reaction may be performed in the presence of a suitable base if Z is halogen e.g. with a metal carbonate or bicarbonate such as potassium carbonate or potassium hydrogen carbonate or preferably with a tertiary amine such as diisopropylethylamine or also pyridine. If Z is hydroxy high temperatures and or addition of dehydrating agents are required. Useful dehydrating agents are for example acid halogenides acid anhydrides carbodiimides and activated azines. Typically the reaction is performed in two steps. Activation of a carboxylic acid RZ IIIa optional transformation of the resulting activated acid into a more stable intermediate followed by reaction with the amine of formula II .

In case of unactivated coupling partners method B is referred to as Buchwald Hartwig reaction and corresponding reaction conditions may be chosen. If Rrepresents an activated phenyl or heteroaryl residue the transformation does not require transition metal catalysis.

Method C wherein M represents a dihydroxy or dialkoxy boron group is also known under the name of Suzuki reaction and corresponding reaction conditions are well known in the art. The reaction is preferably carried out in a dipolar aprotic solvent such as dimethyl formamide or in a polar ether e.g. tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxyethane in the presence of a soluble palladium 0 or related metal catalyst for example tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium. When M represents a trialkoxy silicon group the reaction is performed in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a fluoride source. Typically bis dibenzylideneacetone palladium Pd dba is used in the presence of tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride.

If one or more other functional groups for example carboxy hydroxy or amino are or need to be protected in a compound of formulas II to V because they should not take part in the reaction these are such protecting groups as are usually applied in the synthesis of amides in particular peptide compounds cephalosporins penicillins nucleic acid derivatives and sugars.

The protecting groups may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions such as acylations etherifications esterifications oxidations solvolysis and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily i.e. without undesired secondary reactions to removal typically by solvolysis reduction photolysis or also by enzyme activity for example under conditions analogous to physiological conditions and that they are not present in the end products. The specialist knows or can easily establish which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter.

The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups the protecting groups themselves and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference books for peptide synthesis and in special books on protective groups such as J. F. W. McOmie Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry Plenum Press London and New York 1973 in Methoden der organischen Chemie Methods of organic chemistry Houben Weyl 4th edition Volume 15 I Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart 1974 and in T. W. Greene Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis Wiley New York.

In the additional process steps carried out as desired functional groups of the starting compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected for example by one or more of the protecting groups mentioned hereinabove under protecting groups . The protecting groups are then wholly or partly removed according to one of the methods described there.

In the conversion of an obtainable compound of formula I into another compound of formula I an amino group may be alkylated or acylated to give the correspondingly substituted compounds. Alkylation may be performed with an alkyl halide or an activated alkyl ester. For methylation diazomethane may be used. Alkylation may also be performed with an aldehyde under reducing conditions. For acylation the corresponding acyl chloride is preferred. Alternatively an acid anhydride may be used or acylation may be accomplished with the free acid under conditions used for amide formation known per se in peptide chemistry e.g. with activating agents for the carboxy group such as 1 hydroxybenzotriazole optionally in the presence of suitable catalysts or co reagents. Furthermore amine may be transformed into heteroaryl and heterocyclyl under reaction conditions typical for such cyclizations.

A hydroxy group may be alkylated etherified or acylated esterified to give the correspondingly substituted compounds in a procedure related to the one described for an amino group. Alkylation may be performed with an alkyl halide or an activated alkyl ester. For methylation diazomethane may be used. For acylation the corresponding acyl chloride or acid anhydride may be used or acylation may be accomplished with the free acid and a suitable activating agent.

Reduction of a nitro group in a nitro substituted aryl or heteroaryl group to give the corresponding amino group is done e.g. with iron powder in alcohol or with other reducing agents.

A carboxy group in a carboxy substituted aryl or heteroaryl group may be amidated under conditions used for amide formation known per se in peptide chemistry e.g. with the corresponding amine and an activating agent for the carboxy group such as 1 hydroxy benzotriazole optionally in the presence of suitable catalysts or co reagents.

A chloro bromo or iodo substitutent in an aryl or heteroaryl group may be replaced by phenyl or a phenyl derivative by reaction with a suitable phenylboronic acid in a Suzuki reaction as described under method B .

Salts of a compound of formula I with a salt forming group may be prepared in a manner known per se. Acid addition salts of compounds of formula I may thus be obtained by treatment with an acid or with a suitable anion exchange reagent.

Salts can usually be converted to free compounds e.g. by treating with suitable basic agents for example with alkali metal carbonates alkali metal hydrogencarbonates or alkali metal hydroxides typically potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide.

It should be emphasized that reactions analogous to the conversions mentioned in this chapter may also take place at the level of appropriate intermediates.

All process steps described here can be carried out under known reaction conditions preferably under those specifically mentioned in the absence of or usually in the presence of solvents or diluents preferably such as are inert to the reagents used and able to dissolve these in the absence or presence of catalysts condensing agents or neutralising agents for example ion exchangers typically cation exchangers for example in the H form depending on the type of reaction and or reactants at reduced normal or elevated temperature for example in the range from 100 C. to about 190 C. preferably from about 80 C. to about 150 C. for example at 80 to 60 C. at 20 to 40 C. at room temperature or at the boiling point of the solvent used under atmospheric pressure or in a closed vessel where appropriate under pressure and or in an inert atmosphere for example under argon or nitrogen.

Salts may be present in all starting compounds and transients if these contain salt forming groups. Salts may also be present during the reaction of such compounds provided the reaction is not thereby disturbed.

At all reaction stages isomeric mixtures that occur can be separated into their individual isomers e.g. diastereomers or enantiomers or into any mixtures of isomers e.g. racemates or diastereomeric mixtures.

The invention relates also to those forms of the process in which one starts from a compound obtainable at any stage as a transient and carries out the missing steps or breaks off the process at any stage or forms a starting material under the reaction conditions or uses said starting material in the form of a reactive derivative or salt or produces a compound obtainable by means of the process according to the invention and further processes the said compound in situ.

The reaction is performed in the presence of a suitable palladium catalyst such as Pd dba a further ligand typically a mono or bidentate phosphine derivative and a strong base such as sodium tert butoxide. The reaction is easily controlled such as to avoid diamination of the dihalopyridine or dihalopyrazine.

Metalated compounds of formula V are commercially available or can be prepared from the corresponding phenyl halide. In case of M representing dialkoxyboron compounds of formula V are obtained by Suzuki reaction of the corresponding phenyl halogenide with B OR . If M stands for trialkoxysilicon the compound is prepared by transition metal catalyzed coupling of a phenyl halide with a silylhydride HSi OR .

All the manipulations are performed under sterile conditions. The assays are being performed in commercially available 96 or 384 well flat bottom clear microtiter plates Greiner Germany respectively which are suitable for tissue culture techniques. A defined number of EGFP transfected adherent test cells 96 well plates 10 10 384 well plates 1500 2 10 are plated out 24 h before treatment either in 75 l 96 well plates or 60 l 384 well plates complete medium per well in order to ensure appropriate cell spreading. For this purpose a peristaltic pump e.g. Multidrop by Thermo Labsystems Finland or another suitable device is used. Cells in suspension are plated out according to the same procedure but 1 h prior to treatment. Between seeding out and treatment or addition of compounds the cells are incubated at 37 C. under 7.5 CO. Subsequently the compounds under investigation are added at defined concentrations 40 80 M in either 25 l 96 well plates or 20 l 384 well plates complete medium containing max 4 DMSO with an appropriate device e.g. liquid handling system multi channel pipette etc. resulting in a final concentration in the test well of 10 20 M compound in max 1 DMSO.

Immediately after the addition of the compounds to the cells the zero fluorescence value t 0 h is determined by using a fluorescence microplate reader in order to be able to normalize the fluorescence activities. Afterwards the test plates are further incubated for a total of 48 h at 37 C. under 7.5 COand are shortly removed only for the purpose of measurement at 8 h 24 h and 48 h respectively.

Relative fluorescence activities of EGFP in compound treated test cells in relation to control cells and cells treated with standard drugs are measured by using a BMG Fluostar microplate fluorescence reader equipped with a filter pair for excitation emission at 485 nm 520 nm. The optimum signal to noise ratio is detected by using the time resolved mode of measurement with a delay of 20 s and an integration time over 1 ms. The gain is adjusted in such a way that the control cells produce a fluorescence activity of 90 of the maximum. Kinetics is performed by measuring the relative fluorescence activities at t 0 h 8 h 24 h and 48 h. Crude fluorescence activities are individually normalized for different cell numbers and various optical activities of the test compounds plate wells by dividing each value from t 8 h 24 h and 48 h by the value of t 0 h resulting in E 8 E 24 and E 48 values. Subsequently the E x values are further processed by forming the inverse Q value of the products E 8 E 24 E 48 which result in numbers 1 for apoptotic necrotic activities of the compounds and numbers2 are being considered relevant in terms of apoptotic necrotic activity and are subsequently tested in the secondary screening setup.

All the manipulations are performed under sterile conditions. The assays are being performed in case of adherent cells in commercially available 24 well flat bottom tissue culture plates Greiner Germany and in case of suspension cells in polypropylene tubes P tubes 1.4 ml Matrix UK respectively.

Adherent test cells 2 10 4 10of EGFP transfected cells in 0.5 ml complete medium are plated out 24 h before treatment. At t 0 the medium is removed and 450 l new complete medium is added. Subsequently 50 l complete medium containing the test compound in max. 5 DMSO is added resulting in final concentrations of 20 M 10 M 3 M 1 M and 0.3 M of the test compounds respectively. After 48 h incubation the cells are harvested and analyzed with fluorescence activated cell scanning device FACSCalibur BD Biosciences according to standard procedures.

Suspension cells 10test cells in 450 l complete medium are pipetted into P tubes. 50 l complete medium containing the compounds see adherent cells is added immediately. After 48 h of incubation the test cells are analyzed directly on a FACSCalibur .

By monitoring the EGFP fluorescence activity in FL1 on a FACSCalibur it is possible to distinguish between proliferating cells apoptotic cells and necrotic cells within the same cell population. The proliferating cells show a high GFP fluorescence activity the apoptotic population shows an intermediate fluorescence activity whereas the necrotic cells demonstrate a residual fluorescence activity comparable to mock transfected cells. Within the CellQuest Software BD Biosciences three regions are defined in the histogram M1 comprising the proliferating cells M2 comprising the apoptotic cell population and M3 comprising the necrotic cell population. As readout the relative abundance of the cells belonging either to M1 M2 or M3 are expressed. Compounds inducing M2 values 50 and M3 values
