title: Electrically pumped Group IV semiconductor micro-ring laser
abstract: An electrically pumped semiconductor laser is provided as including a waveguide structure disposed on the substrate. An optical coupling layer is disposed on the substrate and the waveguide. A resonator layer is disposed on the optical coupling layer and may be adapted to include a photonic crystal lattice having a plurality of substantially cylindrical pores extending downwardly into the resonator layer. An insulating cap layer may be disposed on the resonator layer which operatives to seal the photonic crystal lattice. A first plug filled vias is formed on a central region of the cap layer, which extends downwardly to permit a bottom portion of the first plug to communicate with the photonic crystal lattice. Further, a second plug filled vias is formed on an edge region of the cap layer and extends downwardly to permit a bottom portion of the second plug to communicate with the photonic crystal lattice.
