title: Analyzing subordinate sub-expressions in expression recognition
abstract: A mechanism for recognizing and inputting handwritten mathematical expressions into a computer by providing part of a multi-path framework is described. The part of the multi-path framework includes a subordinate sub-expression analysis component. A method for analyzing a handwritten mathematical expression for a subordinate sub-expression includes identifying sub-expressions based on dominant symbols and determining a character for potential dominant symbols based upon sub-expression information. A determination may be made whether an expression structure candidate is valid and valid expression structure candidates may be stored in a parse tree.
