This application is based upon application number 04 028 174.3 filed Nov. 26 2004 with the European patent Office the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference and to which priority is claimed.

The present invention relates to a UV C sterilizing lamp for the treatment of a medium with UV C radiation in order to kill the therein contained microorganisms by means of at least one UV C emitter which has an elongated emitter foundation and at least one electrical connection as well as a base holding the UV C emitter as well as a UV C emitter for the application in such a UV C sterilizing lamp.

UV C sterilizing lamps are used for the sterilization of air in commercially and industrially used spaces as well as in hospitals and airplanes. Their germicidal UV C line radiation with a wavelength of 253.75 nm is being used to kill bacteria fungi or viruses or other microorganisms.

Food production represents a further area of application in which the UV C germinating lamps are used for sterilizing packaging materials for food products of operational equipment and for the sterilization of air.

A disadvantage of the known UV C sterilizing lamps is on the one hand that they are sensitive to water spray and water jets. On the other hand the emitter foundation of such a UV C sterilizing lamp may break so that the falling splinters of the UV C sterilizing lamp contaminate the treated goods or get into the cycle of air sterilizing systems without this being noticed.

The invention is therefore based on the objective of providing an improvement to the known UV C sterilizing lamps which meet the strict requirements with respect to hygiene and operating safety.

This task is solved in that at least the emitter foundation of the UV C emitter is surrounded by a flexible protective cover which is radiolucent to UV C radiation. Teflon for example is a material which is radiolucent to UV C radiation.

The provision of a flexible protective cover guarantees that in the event the emitter foundation breaks no splinters can get unnoticed onto the treatment goods arranged underneath of the UV C sterilizing lamp or into the cycle of sterilizing systems and contaminate these but remain inside the protective cover. Furthermore the provision of the protective cover also achieves a protection against water spray and water jets so that the UV C sterilizing lamps may be cleaned in the traditional way in case of dirt accumulation and that even the requirements for a rating in the IP65 system of protection are met which means at the same time an expansion of the potential field of application of the UV C sterilizing lamps of the invention.

The protective cover may have a thickness of 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm preferably 0.3 mm depending on the application.

An embodiment of the present invention provides that the UV C emitter is cast into the base in the area of its electrical connections by means of casting material and thereby the base is sealed off to the environment. Here the casting material should be resistant to UV C radiation. The base and the UV C emitter form a unit by means of the casting material so that the electric elements inside of the base are protected against the penetration of humidity and furthermore an exchange of a possibly defective UV C emitter for example by untrained personnel may be effectively prevented.

It is expedient to produce the base from a ceramic body whereby it is cost economical to fill the latter especially with glass wool as a filling material.

A further embodiment of the present invention provides that in the base of the UV C sterilizing lamp a clamp is arranged in the base of the UV C sterilizing lamp by means of which the UV C emitter is secured in the base against an undesired removal or falling out when the casting material has already been removed from the base for the disassembly of a defective UV C emitter.

The operating systems for the emitter may be arranged separately outside of the UV C sterilizing lamp and the UV C emitter may be supplied with power via a connection of the external operating systems with contacts at the base of the UV C sterilizing lamp.

As an alternative the UV C emitter may be realized as high output emitter or as a conventional UV C compact low pressure emitter with two discharge tubes.

The UV C sterilizing lamp has a UV C emitter in the form of a high output UV C compact low presser emitter. The UV C emitter has an emitter foundation shown here by way of example with two discharge tubes and electrical connections via which the UV C emitter is connected with the base . The emitter foundation is completely surrounded by a flexible protective cover which is radiolucent to UV C radiation and made from Teflon with a foil thickness of about 0.3 mm.

In the area of its electrical connections the UV C emitter is secured in the base via a clamp not shown and is cast into the base by means of a UV C radiation resistant casting material in order to protect the electrical elements arranged in the base from the penetration of humidity. In this embodiment the base and the UV C emitter are also connected additionally via bolted connections with each other. The bolted connections are also sealed off to the environment for example by the casting material. At the top of the base a cable lead is also planned.

The base has contacts on the side facing away from the UV C emitter via which the UV C sterilizing lamp may be connected to the power supply with operating technology not shown which is arranged outside of the UV C sterilizing lamp .

The protective cover is for example welded to the end of the UV C emitter facing away from the base so that the UV C emitter contained in the protective cover is completely surrounded by the protective cover . Here it is sealed off against the environment and thus against humidity especially from spray water and water jets. In a possible breakage of the emitter foundation therefore no splinters may get unnoticed onto the treated goods arranged underneath the UV C sterilizing lamp or into the cycle of sterilization systems and contaminate them but will remain inside of the protective cover . The protective cover additionally functions as a heat insulation protector so that a decrease of the radiation performance when used in cold environments is prevented.
