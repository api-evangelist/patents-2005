title: Apparatus and method for long term tracking for ASW applications
abstract: An apparatus and method are disclosed that provide target motion analysis with the ability for having long-term tracking. The apparatus and method provide a leg builder program that monitors successive positional updates from a target and converts the updates into a leg format. The leg format consists primarily of start time, latitude/longitude, time on leg, and end latitude/longitude. The leg format is continuously updated so long as the course of the target is steady. The leg format further embodies routines that provide for a spherical earth model and also for handling unstable course and speed conditions from a target.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon or therefor.

The invention relates to a processor and a method of operation thereof particularly suited for target motion analyzers TMA applications and more specifically to an apparatus and method for determining storing and plotting long term tracking history of a target being tracked for anti submarine warfare ASW applications.

Traditional methods of long term tracking of target onboard United States Navy submarines require manual paper and pencil plotting. A person known as a geo plotter manually plots own ship and all target tracks onto a paper plot. This paper plot is typically kept for several days until the submarine moves into a new operating area or until the plot becomes too cluttered to maintain. Naval documents describe existing manual plotting techniques.

For several years electronic geographic plotting programs have been available on submarines however these programs have not been sufficient to replace the manual geo plotter. All previous electronic programs have made the assumption that the tracking period will be less than three hours which is not always the case. These electronic programs also disadvantageously assume a flat earth model and motion through a known water model which sometimes leads to erroneous results. These electronic programs also store data into computer memory in a way that cannot be easily expanded and more importantly such that it may be lost in the event of a power cycle. It is desired that an electronic program be provided that is not predicated on a flat earth model and known motion through the water provides several days of tracking history and utilizes a small amount of computer space whose contents is not destroyed by power cycles while still providing accurate long time plots of targets.

The practice of the present invention provides for an apparatus and method that determine store and plot long term tracking history sometimes covering several days and providing such an apparatus and method that do not consume a major amount of processing power and is free from destruction by power cycling while at the same time allowing for accurate plotting.

A further object of the present invention is to provide long term history that takes into account a spherical earth model.

It is an additional object of the present invention to provide for an apparatus and method for plotting long term history of targets and handling such targets having unstable course and speed conditions.

A method is provided for long term tracking of a target and comprises the steps of monitoring and reading converting and updating. The method a monitors and reads first and second positional updates of a target each of the positional updates comprising latitude and longitude quantities b converts the first and second positional updates into a first leg format comprising bstart time of the second positional update and binterconnected latitude and longitude quantities of each of the first and second positional updates. The method also includes updating the first leg with associated interconnected latitude and longitude quantities when a third positional update occurs which represents a move that exceeds a predetermined distance from the second update while at the same time the update ensures the first second and third positional updates represent that a steady coarse is being pursued by the target. The method repeats the monitoring and reading converting and updating steps for subsequent positional updates.

With reference to there is shown a system that provides for long term tracking of a target for target motion analysis TMA applications. The system primarily comprises a leg builder processor that receives inputs from a target motion analyzer and from a navigational system .

The target motion analyzer TMA known in the art routes signals START target T latitude LXO and target T longitude LYO information respectively on signal paths and to the leg builder processor . The navigational system known in the art routes to the leg builder processor own ship OS latitude LXO and own ship OS longitude LYO via signal paths and .

The leg builder processor is comprised of multiple sub processors and preferably provides three sources of information respectively on signal paths and which in turn are respectively routed to a plotter a project forward previous leg processor and a leg parameter processor both processors and to be further described hereinafter. The plotter also receives output signals on signal path from the project forward previous leg processor and output signals on signal path from the leg parameter processor .

The leg builder processor operates by monitoring successive positional updates each comprised of T LXO and T LYO quantities from TMA and converting these positional updates into a leg format. The leg format consists primarily of a start time latitude longitude time on leg and end latitude longitude. By using a leg format the amount of hard drive space and the computer CPU cycles allocated to the leg builder processor and used to plot the data are significantly reduced over prior art electronic methods for storing and plotting every successive update point. The leg format is stored to computer hard drive in two files per target contact. The current leg to be further described hereinafter being handled by the leg builder processor is stored in one file and is continually updated as long as the course being pursued by the target is steady. All historical legs derived by the leg builder processor are stored in the second file. The historical leg file is only updated periodically with the current leg being handled by the leg builder processor whenever a new leg is determined by the operation of the leg builder processor to be described hereinafter.

In general the leg builder processor a monitors and reads the first and second positional updates for the target b converts the first and second positional updates into a leg format comprising b start time of the second positional update and b interconnected latitude and longitude quantities of each of the first and second updates. The leg and builder processor c updates the first leg when a third positional update occurs which represents a move that exceeds a predetermined distance e.g. 150 yards from the second update while at the same time the update ensures that the first second and third positional updates represent that a steady course is being pursued by the target. The leg builder processor continues by repeating steps a b and c for subsequent positional updates.

The leg builder processor determines new legs by watching the system solution for own ship and all target contacts. When a solution is first received indicated bythe presence of the START signal of signal path the leg builder processor records the target latitude and longitude T LXO and T LYO respectively as well as other information to be described hereinafter and marks the occurrence of START as the start point for the current leg. The operation of the leg builder processor may be further described with reference to the flow diagram of composed of that cumulatively illustrate the overall program comprised of a plurality of program segments the first of which is program segment shown in .

Program segment indicates the initiation of the operation of the leg builder processor . More particularly program segment indicates the detection that the target contact has moved a first predetermined distance of e.g. at least 150 yards and upon the detection passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment determines if this is the first update being serviced by the overall program and if the answer is yes program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment initiates the quantities a b and c all related to determining if a steady speed and steady course are being pursued by the target. Upon completion program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path . Program segment starts the formation of a new or first leg.

In answer to program segment was no in that the output of program segment was not the first update being serviced by the overall program then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path . Program segment calculates the speed from the previous positional update to the current positional update and passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment determines if the speed parameters from any previous update to any update presently being handled by program segment do not differ from each other by more than two 2 knots. If the answer is yes program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path . Program segment then starts a new leg. If the answer to program segment is no program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment and the program segments to be described following it take into account the bearing between the first update identified by the quantity a and the second update identified by the quantity b as well as the bearing between the first update a and the third update identified by the quantity c. Further Program and the program segments to be described following it take into steady and non steady speeds of the target. The initial conditions for program segment are shown as a b b c c current conditions b bearing a to b b bearing a to c and delta diff b to b. Program segment and the program segments following it ensure that if the course from a to b and the course from a to c differ by at least 1 degree then the leg builder processor unsets the steady course flag program segment to be described hereinafter and stops updating the current leg. If the steady course flag is set and the course from a to b and the course from a to c differ by less than 1 degree the leg builder processor updates the end point program segment to be described hereinafter of the leg being formed. Program segment preferably uses a rhumb line calculation known in the art to determine the a to b and b to c courses. Program segment passes control to program segment shown on by way of signal path .

Program segment determines that the steady course of the target is false or true and if the delta between bearings b and b is less than one 1 degree. If the steady course is true and if delta is less than one 1 degree then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment also determines the steady course is true and the delta between bearings b and b is less than 1 degree and if the answer is yes program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment determines that the steady course is not being followed and ends the processing being performed by overall program which waits for the occurrence of program segment .

Program segment upon determination that the steady speed course is being followed passes control to program segment by way of signal path . Program segment updates the current leg that is the end point of the current leg.

If program segment determines that a steady course is not being followed and the delta between b and b is less than one 1 degree program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment determines if the delta between b and the current bearing is greater than 5 degrees and if the answer is yes then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

If the program segment determines that the difference between b and the current bearing being followed is less than five 5 degrees then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment examines the steady speed and the delta speed between the three positions a b and c and if the difference between the steady speed and delta speed is greater than 0.2 knots then program segment passes control to program segment via signal path however if the difference between the steady speed and delta speed is less than 0.2 knots then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment verifies that the steady speed is false and passes control to program segment by way of signal path . Program segment ends the processing being performed by the overall program which awaits for the occurrence of program segment .

Program segment determines if the speed is not steady and if the delta speed exceeds a certain value such as 2 knots and if the course is steady. If the course is not steady and if the answer to the other inquiries is no then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path . If the answer to all inquiries is yes then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment determines if the steady speed is true and then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

Program segment determines that the difference between the leg average speed and current speed is greater than 2 knots and if the answer is no then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path . If however if the answer to program segment is yes then program segment passes control to program segment by way of signal path .

It should now be appreciated that when a solution is first received indicated by the presence of the START signal on signal path the leg builder processor records the associated latitude and longitude of the target as well as other information and marks the occurrence of the START signal as the start point for the current leg of the long term tracking being provided. After the leg builder processor starts a leg the leg builder processor receives updates from the tactical database whenever the contacted target moves at least 150 yards. The leg builder processor keeps the last three updates from the target contact and labels them a b and C. If the course from a b and the course from a c differ by at least 1 degree then the leg builder processor unsets the steady course flag generated by program segment and stops updating the current leg. If the steady course is set and the course from a to b and the course from b to c differ by less than one degree the leg builder processor updates the endpoint generated by program segment of the current leg. If the steady course is not set then the leg builder processor makes no further updates until the a to b course vs. the a to c course steadies up i.e. the difference is less than 1 degree as determined by program segment . When the course steadies up the leg builder processor sets the steady course flag and then program segment looks at the overall course change to determine if a new leg should be created. If the course change is less than 5 degrees the leg builder processor continues as determined by program segment to update the current leg. If the course change is greater than 5 degrees the leg builder processor more particularly program segment establishes the old current leg as a history leg and creates a new current leg. A rhumb line calculation preferably accomplished by program segment is used to determine the a to b and a to c course. The leg builder processor in particular program segment will also trigger a new leg on a speed change of at least 2 knots. The leg builder processor may be further described with reference back to .

As seen in the leg builder processor provides additional processing by way of associated project forward previous leg processor . The project forward previous leg processor comprises routines known in the art so as to project forward previous legs such that all previous legs are connected to one another and also to the current leg so as to be plotted on a geographic plot by plotter . This processing handles the case where connecting legs would not be feasible due to positional changes resulting from new assumptions in the TMA solution resetting the ship s inertial navigation system or shutting down the leg builder processor for a period of time.

As further seen in the leg builder processor also provides additional processing for each leg by way of associated leg parameter processor comprised of routines known in the art as well as a routine that treats the target s plot based on a spherical earth. More particularly for every leg additional information including minimum maximum and average speed set drift and depth starting course and course made good known in the art are provided by leg parameter processor . Table 1 below shows an example of the output of the leg parameter processor when plotted as a geographic plot by plotter .

The plots provided by the processors of the present invention may be further described with reference to .

As seen in the own ships position is given by plots whereas the target position plot is given by plot . The own ship position now function is indicated by reference number whereas target position now function is indicated by reference number .

It can now be appreciated that the present invention provides for geographic parts that are used in situations that allows the operator to click on a leg history so as to view the identity of the track plot being used and to identify that track.

It will be understood that various changes and details steps and arrangements and parts and methods which have been described an illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made with those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the amended claims.
