title: Submarine countermeasure and launch assembly
abstract: In a submarine countermeasure vehicle and launch assembly the vehicle includes a forward end portion, an aft end portion provided with a propeller and fins, a hull portion extending between the forward and aft portions, the hull portion being circular in cross-section, and a thrust ring mounted on the fins and around the propeller, the thrust ring forming a convex configuration. The launch assembly includes a launch tube for retaining and launching the vehicle, a ram plate moveable in the launch tube to push the vehicle out an end of the launch tube, the ram plate having an engagement surface for contact with the thrust ring, the engagement surface being at least in part of a concave configuration. In a launch operation, the concave surface of the ram plate engages the convex configuration of the thrust ring.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by and for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

This invention relates to submarine countermeasure vehicles and launchers and is directed more particularly to a countermeasure and launch assembly which alleviates problems developed in launching by translation or tilting of the countermeasure vehicle in the launch tube.

In there is shown a typical submarine countermeasure apparatus . The apparatus includes a launch tube which in operation is disposed outboard of the submarine pressure hull not shown . A countermeasure vehicle is housed in the launch tube and includes an array assembly and a tailcone assembly . The array assembly is protected by a surrounding sabot . Disposed in the launch tube is a ram plate and a gas generator . The launch tube is closed by a forward tube cover and an aft tube cover .

In operation the gas generator is activated by an electrical pulse from the submarine fire control system and generates sufficient gas pressure to move the ram plate forwardly. The ram plate pushes the countermeasure vehicle forwardly breaking away the forward tube cover and launching the countermeasure vehicle from the launch tube . In due course the sabot disengages from around the array assembly and the array assembly is deployed.

It has been found that upon launch of the countermeasure vehicle the fleet vehicle design is sometimes subjected to substantial bending moments when most of the cylindrical vehicle but not the cylindrical tailcone assembly has exited the launch tube. This occurs from cross flow on the vehicle hull from launching perpendicular to the submarine hull flow. This results in the vehicle being moved sideways in the tube and or being tilted in the tube as the launch progresses. This may result in potentially asymmetrical axial loading of the ram plate which could jam the ram plate intermittently during launch. Any of these conditions can compromise the launch and the resulting deployment. It may also catastrophically result in complete failure of the tailcone assembly forward hull joint and or the local aft zone of the vehicle hull structure thereby destroying or critically damaging the vehicle.

Accordingly there is a need for an improved vehicle and launch assembly which can accommodate severe bending moments and complete a launch under such conditions satisfactorily.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide an improved vehicle and launch assembly facilitating launches of the vehicle in severe environments which cause translation and or tilting of the vehicle in the launch tube.

With the above and other objects in view as will hereinafter appear a feature of the present invention is the provision of a submarine countermeasure vehicle and launch assembly therefor. The vehicle comprises a forward end portion an aft end portion provided with a propeller and fins extending therefrom a hull portion extending between the forward end portion and the aft end portion the hull portion being substantially circular in cross section and a thrust ring mounted on aft portions of the fins and around the propeller the thrust ring forming a convex configuration. The launch assembly comprises a launch tube for retaining and launching the vehicle and a ram plate moveable in the launch tube to push the vehicle out an end of the launch tube the ram plate having an engagement surface for contact with the thrust ring the engagement surface being at least in part of a concave configuration. In a launch operation the concave surface of the ram plate engages the convex configuration of the thrust ring.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that in an improved countermeasure vehicle and launch assembly the vehicle is provided with a tailcone assembly having an aft end of a convex configuration.

The launch assembly includes the launch tube and ram plate the latter provided with a concave surface for engagement with the tail cone assembly aft end convex structure .

The tailcone assembly includes fins disposed around a propeller and to which is fixed a thrust ring . The thrust ring includes a collar portion and hydrodynamically configured radial struts which define the aforesaid tailcone assembly aft end convex configuration. Tailcone assembly and fins can be tapered to avoid contact between tailcone and tube during launch. This will minimize moment loading in the aft structure and joints of the vehicle .

When the vehicle rests in the launch tube the surfaces and are in engagement with each other. As noted above upon initiation of a launch the ram plate pushes the vehicle at a high rate of speed and ejects the vehicle from the launch tube .

To assist in maintaining the vehicle contained within the launch tube the vehicle is conventionally provided with elastomeric pads temporarily bonded to vehicle . However despite such pads the vehicle on occasion translates to a position off center in the launch tube or becomes tilted in the tube .

It has been found that providing the concave engagement surface on the ram plate and the convex configuration on the tail cone thrust ring results in the center of thrust being displaced from center only slightly such that the vehicle is thrust in a direction axial of the launch tube and jamming of the vehicle in the tube is substantially less likely to occur under even the worst of ambient conditions.

It has further been found that an appropriate radius of curvature a for the convex configurations of the thrust ring is about 6.25 inches and that a preferred radius of curvature b for the ram plate engagement surface is twice the radius of curvature a or about 12.5 inches. Alternative radii of curvature for the ram plate engagement surface are 9.75 inches shown at c in and 9.375 inches shown at d in . All of the above mentioned radii have been found to permit the vehicle to realign itself relative to the ram plate.

Referring to it will be seen that the concave surface of the ram plate may be bounded by an annular peripheral planar portion rather than extending throughout the diameter of the ram plate. In this embodiment less machining of the ram plate is required and does not appear to affect the operation of the ram plate or results obtained thereby.

Thus the ram plate concave surface and the tail cone aft end convex configuration allow the tailcone to slide on the ram plate surface and maintain the thrust vector substantially in the center of the ram plate which in turn minimizes the possibility of jamming and high bending moments during a launch in a severe environment.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
