The present invention relates to antibodies and related molecules that specifically bind to C3a Receptor. Such antibodies have uses for example in the prevention and treatment of asthma allergy inflammatory and immune disorders. The invention also relates to nucleic acid molecules encoding anti C3a Receptor antibodies vectors and host cells containing these nucleic acids and methods for producing the same.

Activation of the complement cascade results in the generation of proinflammatory mediators such as the anaphylotoxins C3a C4a and C5a. The receptor for C3a is a seven transmembrane G protein coupled receptor protein. The C3a Receptor shares 40 homology with C5a Receptor. The C3a Receptor also contains an unusually large second extracellular loop between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 which contains the major binding site for C3a. A large portion of the second extracellular loop may be mutated without affecting C3a function at the receptor. This data coupled with the knowledge that the second extracellular loop is conserved across species leaves open the possibility that there may be another as yet unidentified ligand for C3a Chao et al. 1999 274 9721 9728 . C3aR is expressed predominantly on granulocytes and monocytes but has also been found in lung spleen heart placenta spinal cord and brain suggesting an important role in inflammatory reactions in tissues. High levels of expression are found on eosinophils and the mast cell line HMC 1. C3a Receptor expression is also expressed on airway smooth muscle cells. C3a is known to activate and induce chemotaxis of human eosinophils and mast cells Daffern P. J. et al. 1995 181 2119 2127 Nilsson G. et al. 1996 1693 1698 and Stimler Gerard N. P. and Galli S. J. 1987 138 1908 13 as well as to induce contraction of human lung parenchymal strips Stimler N. P. et al eds. Benveniste J. and Amoux B. Elsevier Amsterdam 1983 pp. 195 203 .

Expression of C3a Receptor in airway smooth muscle cells and on cells associated with allergic responses suggested that c3A receptor may be involved in the pathophysiology of asthma and allergy. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways and lung mucosa with a strong correlation to atopy and acquired IgE immunity. However many features of bronchial asthma such as smooth muscle contraction mucus secretion and recruitment of inflammatory cells are consistent with the actions of complement anaphylatoxins in particular C3a and C5a. The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are liberated as activation byproducts and are potent pro inflammatory mediators that bind to specific cell surface receptors and cause leukocyte activation smooth muscle contraction and vascular permeability. Genetic deletion of the C3a Receptor protects against the changes in lung physiology seen after allergen challenge. Furthermore human asthmatics develop significant levels of C3a following intra pulmonary deposition of allergen but not saline. Humbles et al. 2000 406 998 1001 .

Because of the involvement of the C3a Receptor in the promotion of the asthmatic response and other allergic and inflammatory responses in general there is a clear need in the art for agents that can be used to monitor the expression of C3a Receptor and or modulate the biological activities of C3a Receptor.

These and other aspects of the invention are described in further detail below.

The term antibody as used herein refers to immunoglobulin molecules and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecules ie. molecules that contain an antigen binding site that specifically binds an antigen. As such the term antibody encompasses not only whole antibody molecules but also antibody multimers antibody fragments as well as variants including derivatives of antibodies antibody multimers and antibody fragments. Examples of molecules which are described by the term antibody herein include but are not limited to single chain Fvs scFvs Fab fragments Fab fragments F ab disulfide linked Fvs sdFvs Fvs and fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of either a VL or a VH domain. The term single chain Fv or scFv as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising a VL domain of antibody linked to a VH domain of an antibody. Antibodies that specifically bind to C3a Receptor may have cross reactivity with other antigens. Preferably antibodies that specifically bind to C3a Receptor do not cross react with other antigens. Antibodies that specifically bind to C3a Receptor can be identified for example by immunoassays or other techniques known to those of skill in the art e.g. the immunoassays described in the Examples below.

Antibodies of the invention include but are not limited to monoclonal multispecific human or chimeric antibodies single chain antibodies Fab fragments F ab fragments anti idiotypic anti Id antibodies including eg. anti Id antibodies to antibodies of the invention intracellularly made antibodies i.e. intrabodies and epitope binding fragments of any of the above. The immunoglobulin molecules of the invention can be of any type e.g. IgG IgE IgM IgD IgA and IgY class e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgAand IgA or subclass of immunoglobulin molecule. Preferably an antibody of the invention comprises or alternatively consists of a VH domain VH CDR VL domain or VL CDR having an amino acid sequence of any one of those referred to in Table 1 or a fragment or variant thereof. In a preferred embodiment the immunoglobulin is an IgG1 isotype. In another preferred embodiment the immunoglobulin is an IgG4 isotype. Immunoglobulins may have both a heavy and light chain. An array of IgG IgE IgM IgD IgA and IgY heavy chains may be paired with a light chain of the kappa or lambda forms.

Antibodies of the invention may also include multimeric forms of antibodies. For example antibodies of the invention may take the form of antibody dimers trimers or higher order multimers of monomeric immunoglobulin molecules. Dimers of whole immunoglobulin molecules or of F ab 2 fragments are tetravalent whereas dimers of Fab fragments or scFv molecules are bivalent. Individual monomers withon an antibody multimer may be identical or different i.e. they may be heteromeric or homomeric antibody multimers. For example individual antibodies within a multimer may have the same or different binding specificities.

Multimerization of antibodies may be accomplished through natural aggregation of antibodies or through chemical or recombinant linking techniques known in the art. For example some percentage of purified antibody preparations e.g. purified IgG1 molecules spontaneously form protein aggregates containing antibody homodimers and other higher order antibody multimers. Alternatively antibody homodimers may be formed through chemical linkage techniques known in the art. For example heterobifunctional crosslinking agents including but not limited to SMCC succinimidyl 4 maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate and SATA N succinimidyl S acethylthio acetate available for example from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. can be used to form antibody multimers. An exemplary protocol for the formation of antibody homodimers is given in Ghetie et al. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 1997 94 7509 7514 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Antibody homodimers can be converted to Fab 2 homodimers through digestion with pepsin. Another way to form antibody homodimers is through the use of the autophilic T15 peptide described in Zhao and Kohler The Journal of Immunology 2002 25 396 404 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Alternatively antibodies can be made to multimerize through recombinant DNA techniques. IgM and IgA naturally form antibody multimers through the interaction with the J chain polypeptide SEQ ID NO 47 . Non IgA or non IgM molecules such as IgG molecules can be engineered to contain the J chain interaction domain of IgA or IgM thereby conferring the ability to form higher order multimers on the non IgA or non IgM molecules. see for example Chintalacharuvu et al. 2001 Clinical Immunology 101 21 31 and Frigerio et al. 2000 Plant Physiology 123 1483 94. both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties IgA dimers are naturally secreted into the lumen of mucosa lined organs. This secretion is mediated through interaction of the J chain with the polymeric IgA receptor pIgR on epithelial cells. If secretion of an IgA form of an antibody or of an antibody engineered to to contain a J chain interaction domain is not desired it can be greatly reduced by expressing the antibody molecule in association with a mutant J chain that does not interact well with pIgR e.g. SEQ ID NOS 48 50 . Expression of an antibody with one of these mutant J chains will reduce its ability to bind to the polymeric IgA receptor on epithelial cells thereby reducing transport of the antibody across the epithelial cell and its resultant secretion into the lumen of mucosa lined organs. ScFv dimers can also be formed through recombinant techniques known in the art an example of the construction of scFv dimers is given in Goel et al. 2000 Cancer Research 60 6964 6971 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Antibody multimers may be purified using any suitable method known in the art including but not limited to size exclusion chromatography.

By isolated antibody is intended an antibody removed from its native environment. Thus an antibody produced purified from and or contained within a hybridoma and or recombinant host cell is considered isolated for purposes of the present invention.

Unless otherwise defined in the specification specific binding by an antibody to C3a Receptor means that an antibody binds C3a Receptor but does not significantly bind to i.e. cross react with proteins other than C3a Receptor such as other proteins in the same family of proteins . An antibody that binds C3a Receptor protein and does not cross react with other proteins is not necessarily an antibody that does not bind said other proteins in all conditions rather the C3a Receptor specific antibody of the invention preferentially binds C3a Receptor compared to its ability to bind said other proteins such that it will be suitable for use in at least one type of assay or treatment e.g. give low background levels or result in no unreasonable adverse effects in treatment. It is well known that the portion of a protein bound by an antibody is known as the epitope. An epitope may either be linear i.e. comprised of sequential amino acids residues in a protein sequences or conformational i.e. comprised of one or more amino acid residues that are not contiguous in the primary structure of the protein but that are brought together by the secondary tertiary or quaternary structure of a protein . Given that C3a Receptor specific antibodies bind to epitopes of C3a Receptor an antibody that specifically binds C3a Receptor may or may not bind fragments of C3a Receptor and or variants of C3a Receptor e.g. proteins that are at least 90 identical to C3a Receptor depending on the presence or absence of the epitope bound by a given C3a Receptor specific antibody in the C3a Receptor fragment or variant. Likewise C3a Receptor specific antibodies of the invention may bind species orthologues of C3a Receptor including fragments thereof depending on the presence or absence of the epitope recognized by the antibody in the orthologue. Additionally C3a Receptor specific antibodies of the invention may bind modified forms of C3a Receptor for example C3a Receptor fusion proteins. In such a case when antibodies of the invention bind C3a Receptor fusion proteins the antibody must make binding contact with the C3a Receptor moiety of the fusion protein in order for the binding to be specific. Antibodies that specifically bind to C3a Receptor can be identified for example by immunoassays or other techniques known to those of skill in the art e.g. the immunoassays described in the Examples below.

The term variant as used herein refers to a polypeptide that possesses a similar or identical amino acid sequence as a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide an anti C3a Receptor antibody and or antibody fragment thereof. A variant having a similar amino acid sequence refers to a polypeptide that satisfies at least one of the following a a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of an amino acid sequence that is at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 99 identical to the amino acid sequence of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or a fragment thereof an anti C3a Receptor antibody or antibody fragment thereof including a VH domain VHCDR VL domain or VLCDR having an amino acid sequence referred to in Table 1 described herein b a polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence the complementary sequence of which hybridizes under stringent conditions to a nucleotide sequence encoding a C3a Receptor polypeptide e.g. SEQ ID NO 2 a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide an anti C3a Receptor antibody or antibody fragment thereof including a VH domain VHCDR VL domain or VLCDR having an amino acid sequence of any one of those referred to in Table 1 described herein of at least 5 amino acid residues at least 10 amino acid residues at least 15 amino acid residues at least 20 amino acid residues at least 25 amino acid residues at least 30 amino acid residues at least 40 amino acid residues at least 50 amino acid residues at least 60 amino residues at least 70 amino acid residues at least 80 amino acid residues at least 90 amino acid residues at least 100 amino acid residues at least 125 amino acid residues or at least 150 amino acid residues and c a polypeptide encoded by a nucleotide sequence that is at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 99 identical to the nucleotide sequence encoding a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide an anti C3a Receptor antibody or antibody fragment thereof including a VH domain VHCDR VL domain or VLCDR having an amino acid sequence referred to in Table 1 described herein. Preferably a variant C3a Receptor polypeptide a variant fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or a variant anti C3a Receptor antibody and or antibody fragment possesses similar or identical function and or structure as the reference C3a Receptor polypeptide the reference fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or the reference anti C3a Receptor antibody and or antibody fragment respectively.

A polypeptide with similar structure to a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide an anti C3a Receptor antibody or antibody fragment thereof described herein refers to a polypeptide that has a similar secondary tertiary or quaternary structure of a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide an anti C3a Receptor antibody or antibody fragment thereof described herein. The structure of a polypeptide can determined by methods known to those skilled in the art including but not limited to X ray crystallography nuclear magnetic resonance and crystallographic electron microscopy.

To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences or of two nucleic acid sequences the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes e.g. gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence . The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide at the corresponding position in the second sequence then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences i.e. identity number of identical overlapping positions total number of positions 100 . In one embodiment the two sequences are the same length.

The determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm known to those of skill in the art. An example of a mathematical algorithm for comparing two sequences is the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul 87 2264 2268 1990 modified as in Karlin and Altschul 90 5873 5877 1993 . The BLASTn and BLASTx programs of Altschul et al. 215 403 410 1990 have incorporated such an alogrithm. BLAST nucleotide searches can be performed with the BLASTn program score 100 wordlength 12 to obtain nucleotide sequences homologous to a nucleic acid molecules of the invention. BLAST protein searches can be performed with the BLASTx program score 50 wordlength 3 to obtain amino acid sequences homologous to a protein molecules of the invention. To obtain gapped alignment for comparison purposes Gapped BLAST can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. 25 3589 3402 1997 . Alternatively PSI BLAST can be used to perform an iterated search which detects distant relationships between molecules Id. . When utilizing BLAST Gapped BLAST and PSI BLAST programs the default parameters of the respective programs e.g. BLASTx and BLASTn can be used.

Another example of a mathematical algorithm utilized for the comparison of sequences is the algorithm of Myers and Miller CABIOS 1989 . The ALIGN program version 2.0 which is part of the GCG sequence alignment software package has incorporated such an alogrithm. Other algorithms for sequence analysis known in the art include ADVANCE and ADAM as described in Torellis and Robotti 10 3 5 1994 and FASTA described in Pearson and Lipman 85 2444 8 1988 . Within FASTA ktup is a control option that sets the sensitivity and speed of the search.

The term derivative as used herein refers to a variant polypeptide of the invention that comprises or alternatively consists of an amino acid sequence of a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or an antibody of the invention that specifically binds to a C3a Receptor polypeptide which has been altered by the introduction of amino acid residue substitutions deletions or additions. The term derivative as used herein also refers to a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or an antibody that specifically binds to a C3a Receptor polypeptide which has been modified e.g. by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the polypeptide. For example but not by way of limitation a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or an anti C3a Receptor antibody may be modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein etc. A derivative of a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or an anti C3a Receptor antibody may be modified by chemical modifications using techniques known to those of skill in the art including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin etc. Further a derivative of a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or an anti C3a Receptor antibody may contain one or more non classical amino acids. A polypeptide derivative possesses a similar or identical function as a C3a Receptor polypeptide a fragment of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or an anti C3a Receptor antibody described herein.

The term fragment as used herein refers to a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of at least 5 amino acid residues at least 10 amino acid residues at least 15 amino acid residues at least 20 amino acid residues at least 25 amino acid residues at least 30 amino acid residues at least 35 amino acid residues at least 40 amino acid residues at least 45 amino acid residues at least 50 amino acid residues at least 60 amino residues at least 70 amino acid residues at least 80 amino acid residues at least 90 amino acid residues or at least 100 amino acid residues of the amino acid sequence of C3a Receptor or an anti C3a Receptor antibody including molecules such as scFv s that comprise or alternatively consist of antibody fragments or variants thereof that specifically binds to C3a Receptor.

The term host cell as used herein refers to the particular subject cell transfected with a nucleic acid molecule and the progeny or potential progeny of such a cell. Progeny may not be identical to the parent cell transfected with the nucleic acid molecule due to mutations or environmental influences that may occur in succeeding generations or integration of the nucleic acid molecule into the host cell genome.

As used herein the phrase splice variant refers to cDNA molecules produced from a RNA molecules initially transcribed from the same genomic DNA sequence which have undergone alternative RNA splicing. Alternative RNA splicing occurs when a primary RNA transcript undergoes splicing generally for the removal of introns which results in the production of more than one mRNA molecule each of which may encode different amino acid sequences. The term splice variant also refers to the proteins encoded by the above cDNA molecules.

Herein C3a Receptor proteins and C3a Receptor polypeptides may refer to not only to the protein of SEQ ID NO 2 but also to fragments and variants of the protein of SEQ ID NO 2 as well as proteins resulting from the alternate splicing of the genomic DNA sequences encoding proteins having regions of amino acid sequence identity and C3a Receptor activity which correspond to the protein of SEQ ID NO 2 as well as C3a Receptor allellic variants.

Herein the phrase antibody compositions includes antibodies of the invention including fragments and variants thereof as well as polynucleotides encoding antibodies of the invention. The antibodies and polynucleotide may be associated covalently or non covalently with heterologous amino acid or nucleotide sequences respectively. In addition antibody compositions may include other therapeutic or diagnostic agents such as those described herein.

The basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains each pair having one light about 25 kDa and one heavy chain about 50 70 kDa . The amino terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu delta gamuna alpha or epsilon and define the antibody s isotype as IgM IgD IgG IgA and IgE respectively. See generally Ch. 7 Paul W. ed. 2nd ed. Raven Press N.Y. 1989 incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes . The variable regions of each light heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site.

Thus an intact IgG antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies the two binding sites are the same.

The chains all exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions FR joined by three hyper variable regions also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the heavy and the light chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N terminal to C terminal both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1987 and 1991 or Chothia Lesk 196 901 917 1987 Chothia et al. 342 878 883 1989 .

A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab fragments. See e.g. Songsivilai Lachmann 79 315 321 1990 Kostelny et al. 148 1547 1553 1992 . In addition bispecific antibodies may be formed as diabodies Holliger et al. Diabodies small bivalent and bispecific antibody fragments PNAS USA 90 6444 6448 1993 or Janusins Traunecker et al. Bispecific single chain molecules Janusins target cytotoxic lymphocytes on HIV infected cells 10 3655 3659 1991 and Traunecker et al. Janusin new molecular design for bispecific reagents 7 51 52 1992 .

Production of bispecific antibodies can be a relatively labor intensive process compared with production of conventional antibodies and yields and degree of purity are generally lower for bispecific antibodies. Bispecific antibodies do not exist in the form of fragments having a single binding site e.g. Fab Fab and Fv .

The present invention encompasses antibodies including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof that specifically bind to a C3a Receptor polypeptide or a fragment variant or fusion protein thereof. A C3a Receptor polypeptide includes but is not limited to C3a Receptor SEQ ID NO 2 or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA contained in ATCC Deposit No. 75982 on Aug. 21 1997. C3a Receptor may be produced through recombinant expression of nucleic acids encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 e.g. the cDNA in the ATCC Deposit Number 75982 . Antibodies of the invention may specifically bind C3a Receptor as well as fragments and variants thereof and are described in more detail below.

In certain embodiments of the present invention the antibodies of the present invention bind C3a Receptor polypeptide or fragments or variants thereof. The following section describes the C3a Receptor polypeptides fragments and variants that may be bound by the antibodies of the invention in more detail. C3a Receptor is also described in United States Application Publication Number US20030022130 and International Publication Number WO96 25432 which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

In certain embodiments the antibodies of the present invention specifically bind C3a Receptor polypeptide. An antibody that specifically binds C3a Receptor may in some embodiments bind fragments variants including species orthologs and allelic variants of C3a Receptor multimers or modified forms of C3a Receptor. For example an antibody specific for C3a Receptor may bind the C3a Receptor moiety of a fusion protein comprising all or a portion of C3a Receptor.

Antibodies that bind C3a Receptor polypeptides may bind them as isolated polypeptides or in their naturally occurring state. For example antibodies of the present invention may bind recombinantly produced C3a Receptor polypeptides. In a specific embodiment antibodies of the present invention bind a C3a Receptor polypeptide purified from a cell culture wherein the cells in said cell culture comprise a polynucleotide encoding amino acids 1 to 482 of SEQ ID NO 2 operably associated with a regulatory sequence that controls expression of said polynucleotide.

Protein fragments may be free standing or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region most preferably as a single continuous region. Antibodies of the present invention may bind polypeptide fragments including for example fragments that comprise or alternatively consist of from about amino acid residues 1 to 23 24 to 43 44 to 63 64 to 83 and or 84 to 104 105 to 125 126 150 151 to 175 176 to 200 201 to 225 2226 to 250 251 to 275 276 to 300 301 to 325 326 to 350 351 to 375 376 to 400 401 to 425 426 to 450 451 to 875 476 to 482 of SEQ ID NO 2. In this context about includes the particularly recited value larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids at either extreme or at both extremes. Moreover polypeptide fragments bound by the antibodies of the invention can be at least about 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 or 100 amino acids in length. In this context about includes the particularly recited value larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids at either extreme or at both extremes.

Preferably antibodies of the present invention bind polypeptide fragments selected from the group a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of a fragment of the predicted mature C3a Receptor polypeptide wherein the fragment has a C3a Receptor functional activity e.g. antigenic activity or biological activity and a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of one two three four or more epitope bearing portions of the C3a Receptor protein. In additional embodiments the polypeptide fragments of the invention comprise or alternatively consist of any combination of 1 2 3 4 or all 5 of the above members. The amino acid residues constituting the preferred epitopes have been predicted by computer analysis. Thus as one of ordinary skill would appreciate the amino acid residues constituting these domains may vary slightly e.g. by about 1 to about 15 amino acid residues depending on the criteria used to define each epitope. Polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides are also encompassed by the invention.

In another preferred embodiment antibodies of the present invention bind C3a Receptor polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the expressed and or mature polypeptide of C3a Receptor amino acid residues 1 1482 of SEQ ID NO 2 . In highly preferred embodiments the antibodies of the invention that bind all or a portion of the mature C3a Receptor polypeptide inhibit C3a Receptor induced biological activities e.g. constriction of airway smooth muscle activation chemotaxis and or degranulation of granulocytes and or mast cells in the C3a Receptor expressing cells e.g. airway smooth muscle cells mast cells and granulocytes such as eosinophils .

In another embodiment antibodies of the present invention bind C3a Receptor polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the extracellular domains of C3a Receptor e.g. amino acid residues 1 21 84 96 162 332 and 404 416 in SEQ IN NO 2 . In a preferred embodiment antibodies of the present invention bind C3a Receptor polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the second extracellular loop of C3a Receptor amino acid residues 162 332 in SEQ ID NO 2 .

In another preferred embodiment antibodies of the present invention bind C3a Receptor polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues 161 186 or 309 341 in SEQ ID NO 2 and inhibit or abolish C3a binding to C3a receptor.

In another embodiment antibodies of the present invention bind C3a Receptor polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of a transmembrane domain e.g. amino acid residues 22 50 58 83 97 118 138 161 333 361 378 403 417 440 in SEQ ID NO 2 or an intracellular domain e.g. amino acid residues 51 57 119 137 362 377 441 482 in SEQ ID NO 2 .

Antibodies of the invention may also bind fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of structural or functional attributes of C3a Receptor. Such fragments include amino acid residues that comprise alpha helix and alpha helix forming regions alpha regions beta sheet and beta sheet forming regions beta regions turn and turn forming regions turn regions coil and coil forming regions coil regions hydrophilic regions hydrophobic regions alpha amphipathic regions beta amphipathic regions surface forming regions and high antigenic index regions i.e. containing four or more contiguous amino acids having an antigenic index of greater than or equal to 1.5 as identified using the default parameters of the Jameson Wolf program of complete i.e. full length C3a Receptor. Certain preferred regions are those set out in Table 2 and include but are not limited to regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence depicted in SEQ ID NO 2 such preferred regions include Gamier Robson predicted alpha regions beta regions turn regions and coil regions Chou Fasman predicted alpha regions beta regions and turn regions Kyte Doolittle predicted hydrophilic regions Eisenberg alpha and beta amphipathic regions Emini surface forming regions and Jameson Wolf high antigenic index regions as predicted using the default parameters of these computer programs.

The data representing the structural or functional attributes of C3a Receptor set forth in Table 2 as described above was generated using the various modules and algorithms of the DNA STAR set on default parameters. Column I represents the results of a Garnier Robson analysis of alpha helical regions Column II represents the results of a Chou Fasman analysis of alpha helical regions Column III represents the results of a Gamier Robson analysis of beta sheet regions Column IV represents the results of a Chou Fasman analysis of beta sheet regions Column V represents the results of a Gamier Robson analysis of turn regions Column VI represents the results of a Chou Fasman analysis of turn regions Column VII represents the results of a Gamier Robson analysis of coil regions Column VIII represents a Kyte Doolittle hydrophilicity plot Column Column IX represents a Hopp Woods hydrophobicity plot Column IX represents the results of an Eisenberg analysis of alpha amphipathic regions Column X represents the results of an Eisenberg analysis of beta amphipathic regions Column XI represents the results of a Karplus Schultz analysis of flexible regions Column XII represents the Jameson Wolf antigenic index score and Column XIII represents the Emini surface probability plot.

In a preferred embodiment the data presented in columns VIII XII and XII of Table 2 can be used to determine regions of C3a Receptor which exhibit a high degree of potential for antigenicity. Regions of high antigenicity are determined from the data presented in columns VIII XII and XII by choosing values which represent regions of the polypeptide which are likely to be exposed on the surface of the polypeptide in an environment in which antigen recognition may occur in the process of initiation of an immune response.

The above mentioned preferred regions set out in Table 2 include but are not limited to regions of the aforementioned types identified by analysis of the amino acid sequence set out in SEQ ID NO 2. As set out in Table 2 such preferred regions include Garnier Robson alpha regions beta regions turn regions and coil regions Chou Fasman alpha regions beta regions and turn regions Kyte Doolittle hydrophilic regions Eisenberg alpha and beta amphipathic regions Karplus Schulz flexible regions Jameson Wolf regions of high antigenic index and Emini surface forming regions. Among preferred polypeptide fragments bound by one or more antibodies of the invention are those that comprise regions of C3a Receptor that combine several structural features such as several e.g. 1 2 3 or 4 of the same or different region features set out above and in Table 2.

In another aspect the invention provides an antibody that binds a peptide or polypeptide comprising an epitope bearing portion of a polypeptide described herein. The epitope of this polypeptide portion is an immunogenic or antigenic epitope of a polypeptide of the invention. An immunogenic epitope is defined as a part of a protein that elicits an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen. On the other hand a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind is defined as an antigenic epitope. The number of immunogenic epitopes of a protein generally is less than the number of antigenic epitopes. See for instance Geysen et al. 81 3998 4002 1983 .

As to the selection of peptides or polypeptides bearing an antigenic epitope i.e. that contain a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind it is well known in that art that relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein. See for instance Sutcliffe J. G. Shinnick T. M. Green N. and Leamer R. A. 1983 Antibodies that react with predetermined sites on proteins. 219 660 666. Peptides capable of eliciting protein reactive sera are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins i.e. immunogenic epitopes nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals.

Antigenic epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides are therefore useful to raise antibodies including monoclonal antibodies that bind to a C3a Receptor polypeptide of the invention. See for instance Wilson et al. 37 767 778 1984 at 777. Antigenic epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides preferably contain a sequence of at least seven more preferably at least nine and most preferably between at least about 15 to about 30 amino acids contained within the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2.

Antibodies of the invention may bind one or more antigenic C3a Receptor polypeptides or peptides including but not limited to a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 7 to about 12 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 165 to about 170 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 191 to about 197 a polypeptide comprising acid residues from about 204 to about 220 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 235 to about 247 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 280 to about 287 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 323 to about 329 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 363 to about 374 a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 404 to about 409 and or a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about 475 to about 479 of SEQ ID NO 2. In this context about includes the particularly recited range larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids at either terminus or at both termini. As indicated above the inventors have determined that the above polypeptide fragments are antigenic regions of the C3a Receptor protein. Epitope bearing C3a Receptor peptides and polypeptides may be produced by any conventional means. Houghten R. A. General method for the rapid solid phase synthesis of large numbers of peptides specificity of antigen antibody interaction at the level of individual amino acids 82 5131 5135 1985 . This Simultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis SMPS process is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211 to Houghten et al. 1986 .

As one of skill in the art will appreciate C3a Receptor polypeptides and the epitope bearing fragments thereof described herein can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgG resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half life in vivo. This has been shown e.g. for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins EPA 394 827 Traunecker et al. 331 84 86 1988 . Fusion proteins that have a disulfide linked dimeric structure due to the IgG part can also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric C3a Receptor protein or protein fragment alone Fountoulakis et al. 270 3958 3964 1995 . Thus antibodies of the invention may bind fusion proteins that comprise all or a portion of a C3a Receptor polypeptide.

Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or muteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions deletions additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show e.g. enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide at least under certain purification and storage conditions. Antibodies of the present invention may also bind such modified C3a Receptor polypeptides or C3a Receptor polypeptide fragments or variants.

For instance for many proteins including the extracellular domain of a membrane associated protein or the mature form s of a secreted protein it is known in the art that one or more amino acids may be deleted from the N terminus or C terminus without substantial loss of biological function or loss of the ability to be bound by a specific antibody. For instance Ron et al. 268 2984 2988 1993 reported modified KGF proteins that had heparin binding activity even if 3 8 or 27 amino terminal amino acid residues were missing.

However even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the N terminus of a protein results in modification or loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities ability to multimerize ability to reduce insulin and or cellular glucose uptake may still be retained. For example the ability of shortened C3a Receptor polypeptides to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the C3a Receptor polypeptides generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the N terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking N terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a C3a Receptor polypeptide with a large number of deleted N terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six C3a Receptor amino acid residues may be antigenic.

Accordingly the present invention further provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more residues deleted from the amino terminus of the C3a Receptor amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 up to the Valine residue at position 477 and polynucleotides encoding such polypeptides. In particular the present invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising the amino acid sequence of residues n 482 of SEQ ID NO 2 where nis an integer from 2 to 477 corresponding to the position of the amino acid residue in SEQ ID NO 2.

More in particular the invention provides antibodies that bind polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of the amino acid sequence of residues of A 2 to V482 S 3 to V482 F4 to V482 S 5 to V482 A 6 to V 482 E 7 to V 482 T 8 to V 482 N 9 to V482 S 10 to V482 T 11 to V482 D 12 to V482 L 13 to V482 L 14 to V 482 S 15 to V 482 Q 16 to V 482 P 17 to V 482 W 18 to V482 N 19 to V482 E 20 to

The present invention also encomapsses antibodies that bind C3a Receptor polypeptides that comprise or alternatively consist of an amino acid sequence at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 identical to the amino acid sequence described above.

As mentioned above even if deletion of one or more amino acids from the C terminus of a protein results in modification of loss of one or more biological functions of the protein other functional activities e.g. biological activities such as the ability to induce resistance to cellular insulin and or glucose uptake may still be retained. For example the ability of the shortened C3a Receptor polypeptide to induce and or bind to antibodies which recognize the complete or mature forms of the C3a Receptor polypeptide generally will be retained when less than the majority of the residues of the complete or mature polypeptide are removed from the C terminus. Whether a particular polypeptide lacking C terminal residues of a complete polypeptide retains such immunologic activities can readily be determined by routine methods described herein and otherwise known in the art. It is not unlikely that a C3a Receptor polypeptide with a large number of deleted C terminal amino acid residues may retain some biological or immunogenic activities. In fact peptides composed of as few as six C3a Receptor amino acid residues may be antigenic.

In another embodiment antibodies of the invention bind C terminal deletions of the C3a Receptor polypeptide that can be described by the general formula 1 mwhere mis a number from 6 to 481 corresponding to the amino acid sequence identified of SEQ ID NO 2.

A 6 of SEQ ID NO 2. The present invention also encomapsses antibodies that bind C3a Receptor polypeptides that comprise or alternatively consist of an amino acid sequence at least 80 85 90 92 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 identical to the amino acid sequence described above.

The invention also provides antibodies that bind polypeptides having one or more amino acids deleted from both the amino and the carboxyl termini of a C3a Receptor polypeptide which may be described generally as having residues n mof SEQ ID NO 2 where nand mare integers as described above.

It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequence of C3a Receptor can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein. If such differences in sequence are contemplated it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity. Such areas will usually comprise residues which make up the ligand binding site or which form tertiary structures which affect these domains.

Thus the invention further includes antibodies that bind variations of the C3a Receptor protein which show substantial C3a Receptor protein activity or which include regions of C3a Receptor such as the protein fragments discussed below. Such mutants include deletions insertions inversions repeats and type substitution. Guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent can be found in Bowie J. U. et al. 247 1306 1310 1990 .

Thus antibodies of the present invention may bind a fragment derivative or analog of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 or that encoded by the cDNA in ATCC deposit 75982. Such fragments variants or derivatives may be i one in which at least one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non conserved amino acid residue preferably a conserved amino acid residue s and more preferably at least one but less than ten conserved amino acid residues and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code or ii one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group or iii one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound such as a compound to increase the half life of the polypeptide for example polyethylene glycol or iv one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide such as an IgG Fc fusion region peptide or leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the mature polypeptide or a proprotein sequence. Such fragments derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.

Of particular interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with another charged amino acid and with neutral or negatively charged amino acids. The latter results in proteins with reduced positive charge to improve the characteristics of the C3a Receptor protein. The prevention of aggregation is highly desirable. Aggregation of proteins not only results in a loss of activity but can also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations because they can be immunogenic. Pinckard et al. 2 331 340 1967 Robbins et al. 36 838 845 1987 Cleland et al. 10 307 377 1993 .

In addition antibodies of the present invention may bind a C3a Receptor that contains one or more amino acid substitutions deletions or additions either from natural mutations or human manipulation.

Amino acids in the C3a Receptor protein of the present invention that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art such as site directed mutagenesis or alanine scanning mutagenesis Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as ligand e.g. C3a anaphlytoxin amino acids 672 748 of GenBank Accession Number AAA85332.1 binding or in vitro or in vivo the ability to induce calcium flux in C3a Receptor expressing cells upon exposure to C3a. the ability to cause contraction of airway smooth muscle upon interaction with C3a the ability to activate induce chemotaxis of promote degranulation of mast cells and or granulocytes such as eosinophils. Sites that are critical for ligand receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling Smith et al. 224 899 904 1992 and de Vos et al. 255 306 312 1992 . In preferred embodiments antibodies of the present invention bind regions of C3a Receptor that are essential for C3a Receptor function. In other preferred embodiments antibodies of the present invention bind regions of C3a Receptor that are essential for C3a Receptor function and inhibit or abolish C3a Receptor function. In other preferred embodiments antibodies of the present invention bind regions of C3a Receptor that are essential for C3a Receptor function and enhance C3a Receptor function.

Additionally protein engineering may be employed to improve or alter the characteristics of C3a Receptor polypeptides. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel mutant proteins or muteins including single or multiple amino acid substitutions deletions additions or fusion proteins. Such modified polypeptides can show e.g. enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition they may be purified in higher yields and show better solubility than the corresponding natural polypeptide at least under certain purification and storage conditions. Antibodies of the present invention may bind such modified C3a Receptor polypeptides.

Non naturally occurring variants of C3a Receptor may be produced using art known mutagenesis techniques which include but are not limited to oligonucleotide mediated mutagenesis alanine scanning PCR mutagenesis site directed mutagenesis see e.g. Carter et al. 13 4331 1986 and Zoller et al. 10 6487 1982 cassette mutagenesis see e.g. Wells et al. 34 315 1985 restriction selection mutagenesis see e.g. Wells et al. 317 415 1986 .

Thus the invention also encompasses antibodies that bind C3a Receptor derivatives and analogs that have one or more amino acid residues deleted added or substituted to generate C3a Receptor polypeptides that are better suited for expression scale up etc. in the host cells chosen. For example cysteine residues can be deleted or substituted with another amino acid residue in order to eliminate disulfide bridges N linked glycosylation sites can be altered or eliminated to achieve for example expression of a homogeneous product that is more easily recovered and purified from yeast hosts which are known to hyperglycosylate N linked sites. To this end a variety of amino acid substitutions at one or both of the first or third amino acid positions on any one or more of the glycosylation recognition sequences in the C3a Receptor polypeptides and or an amino acid deletion at the second position of any one or more such recognition sequences will prevent glycosylation of C3a Receptor at the modified tripeptide sequence see e.g. Miyajimo et al. 5 6 1193 1197 . Additionally one or more of the amino acid residues of C3a Receptor polypeptides e.g. arginine and lysine residues may be deleted or substituted with another residue to eliminate undesired processing by proteases such as for example furins or kexins.

The antibodies of the present invention also include antibodies that bind a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNAs the deposit having ATCC Accession Number 75982 or a polypeptide comprising or alternatively consisting of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 as well as polypeptides which are at least 80 identical more preferably at least 90 or 95 identical still more preferably at least 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polypeptides described above e.g. the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA clones the deposit having ATCC Accession Number 75982 the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2 and portions of such polypeptides comprising at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 amino acids.

By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference amino acid sequence of a C3a Receptor polypeptide is intended that the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the reference amino acid of the C3a Receptor polypeptide. In other words to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95 identical to a reference amino acid sequence up to 5 of the amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another amino acid or a number of amino acids up to 5 of the total amino acid residues in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.

Antibodies or antibody compositions of the present invention may be used as a practical matter whether any particular polypeptide is at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for instance the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 2 or to the amino acid sequence encoded by deposited CDNA clones can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such the Bestfit program Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Version 8 for Unix Genetics Computer Group University Research Park 575 Science Drive Madison Wis. 53711. When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is for instance 95 identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention the parameters are set of course such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference amino acid sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5 of the total number of amino acid residues in the reference sequence are allowed.

In a specific embodiment the identity between a reference query sequence a sequence of the present invention and a subject sequence also referred to as a global sequence alignment is determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. Comp. App. Biosci. 6 237 245 1990 . Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are Matrix PAM 0 k tuple 2 Mismatch Penalty 1 Joining Penalty 20 Randomization Group Length 0 Cutoff Score 1 Window Size sequence length Gap Penalty 5 Gap Size Penalty 0.05 Window Size 500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence whichever is shorter. According to this embodiment if the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N or C terminal deletions not because of internal deletions a manual correction is made to the results to take into consideration the fact that the FASTDB program does not account for N and C terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N and C termini relative to the query sequence the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N and C terminal of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with a corresponding subject residue as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. A determination of whether a residue is matched aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of this embodiment. Only residues to the N and C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is only query residue positions outside the farthest N and C terminal residues of the subject sequence. For example a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N terminus of the subject sequence and therefore the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching alignment of the first 10 residues at the N terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10 of the sequence number of residues at the N and C termini not matched total number of residues in the query sequence so 10 is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90 . In another example a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N or C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again only residue positions outside the N and C terminal ends of the subject sequence as displayed in the FASTDB alignment which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are made for the purposes of this embodiment.

The present application is also directed to antibodies that bind proteins containing polypeptides at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the C3a Receptor polypeptide sequence set forth herein as n 482 1 m and n m. In preferred embodiments the application encomapsses antibodies that bind proteins containing polypeptides at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to polypeptides having the amino acid sequence of the specific C3a Receptor N and C terminal deletions recited herein.

In certain preferred embodiments antibodies of the invention bind C3a Receptor fusion proteins as described above wherein the C3a Receptor portion of the fusion protein are those described as n 482 1 m and n mherein.

C3a Receptor proteins may be either monomers e.g. the naturally occurring C3a Receptor is monomeric or multimers e.g. dimers trimers tetramers and higher multimers that usually are the result of recombinant protein technology . Accordingly the present invention relates to antibodies that bind C3a Receptor proteins found as monomers or as part of multimers. In specific embodiments antibodies of the invention bind C3a Receptor monomers dimers trimers or tetramers. In additional embodiments antibodies of the invention bind at least dimers at least trimers or at least tetramers containing one or more C3a Receptor polypeptides.

Antibodies of the invention may bind C3a Receptor homomers or heteromers. As used herein the term homomer refers to a multimer containing only C3a Receptor proteins of the invention including C3a Receptor fragments variants and fusion proteins as described herein . These homomers may contain C3a Receptor proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences. In a specific embodiment a homomer of the invention is a multimer containing only C3a Receptor proteins having an identical polypeptide sequence. In another specific embodiment antibodies of the invention bind C3a Receptor homomers containing C3a Receptor proteins having different polypeptide sequences. In specific embodiments antibodies of the invention bind a C3a Receptor homodimer e.g. containing C3a Receptor proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences or a homotrimer e.g. containing C3a Receptor proteins having identical or different polypeptide sequences . In additional embodiments antibodies of the invention bind at least a homodimer at least a homotrimer or at least a homotetramer of C3a Receptor.

In additional embodiments the antibodies of the invention bind at least a heterodimer at least a heterotrimer or at least a heterotetramer containing one or more C3a Receptor polypeptides.

Antibodies of the invention may bind multimers that are the result of hydrophobic hydrophilic ionic and or covalent associations and or may be indirectly linked by for example liposome formation. Thus in one embodiment multimers that may antibodies of the invention may bind such as for example homodimers or homotrimers are formed when C3a Receptor proteins contact one another in solution. In another embodiment heteromultimers that antibodies of the invention may bind such as for example heterotrimers or heterotetramers are formed when proteins of the invention contact antibodies to C3a Receptor polypeptides or antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein in solution. In other embodiments multimers that antibodies of the invention may bind are formed by covalent associations with and or between the C3a Receptor proteins of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence of the protein e.g. the polypeptide sequence recited in SEQ ID NO 2 or the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA clone of ATCC Deposit 75982 . In one instance the covalent associations are cross linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences of the proteins which interact in the native i.e. naturally occurring polypeptide. In another instance the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a C3a Receptor fusion protein. In one example covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 . In a specific example the covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a C3a Receptor Fc fusion protein as described herein . In another specific example covalent associations of fusion proteins are between heterologous polypeptide sequences from another C3a Receptor related polypeptides e.g. C5a receptor that are capable of forming covalently associated multimers such as for example oseteoprotegerin see e.g. International Publication No. WO 98 49305 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Antibodies of the invention may bind multimers that were generated using chemical techniques known in the art. For example proteins desired to be contained in multimers may be chemically cross linked using linker molecules and linker molecule length optimization techniques known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Additionally multimers that antibodies of the invention may bind can be generated using techniques known in the art to form one or more inter molecule cross links between the cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequence of the proteins desired to be contained in the multimer see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . Further proteins that antibodies of the invention may bind can be routinely modified by the addition of cysteine or biotin to the C terminus or N terminus of the polypeptide sequence of the protein and techniques known in the art may be applied to generate multimers containing one or more of these modified proteins see e.g. U.S. Pat.

Alternatively antibodies of the invention may bind multimers that were generated using genetic engineering techniques known in the art. In one embodiment proteins contained in multimers that antibodies of the invention may bind are produced recombinantly using fusion protein technology described herein or otherwise known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In a specific embodiment polynucleotides coding for a homodimer that antibodies of the invention may bind are generated by ligating a polynucleotide sequence encoding a C3a Receptor polypeptide to a sequence encoding a linker polypeptide and then further to a synthetic polynucleotide encoding the translated product of the polypeptide in the reverse orientation from the original C terminus to the N terminus see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety . In another embodiment recombinant techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are applied to generate recombinant C3a Receptor polypeptides which contain a transmembrane domain and which can be incorporated by membrane reconstitution techniques into liposomes see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Proteins comprising multiple C3a Receptor polypeptides separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology. In specific embodiments antibodies of the invention bind proteins comprising multiple C3a Receptor polypeptides separated by peptide linkers.

Another method for preparing multimer C3a Receptor polypeptides involves use of C3a Receptor polypeptides fused to a leucine zipper or isoleucine polypeptide sequence. Leucine zipper domains and isoleucine zipper domains are polypeptides that promote multimerization of the proteins in which they are found. Leucine zippers were originally identified in several DNA binding proteins Landschulz et al. Science 240 1759 1988 and have since been found in a variety of different proteins. Among the known leucine zippers are naturally occurring peptides and derivatives thereof that dimerize or trimerize. Examples of leucine zipper domains suitable for producing soluble multimeric C3a Receptor proteins are those described in PCT application WO 94 10308 hereby incorporated by reference. Recombinant fusion proteins comprising a soluble C3a Receptor polypeptide fused to a peptide that dimerizes or trimerizes in solution are expressed in suitable host cells and the resulting soluble multimeric C3a Receptor is recovered from the culture supernatant using techniques known in the art. In specific embodiments antibodies of the invention bind C3a Receptor leucine zipper fusion protein monomers and or C3a Receptor leucine zipper fusion protein multimers.

It is specifically contemplated that antibodies of the present invention may bind modified forms of the C3a Receptor protein SEQ ID NO 2 

In specific embodiments antibodies of the present invention may bind C3a Receptor polypeptides such as those described above including but not limited to naturally purified C3a Receptor polypeptides C3a Receptor polypeptides produced by chemical synthetic procedures and C3a Receptor polypeptides produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host including for example bacterial yeast higher plant insect and manmmalian cells using for example the recombinant compositions and methods described above. Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure the polypeptides may be glycosylated or non glycosylated. In addition C3a Receptor polypeptides may also include an initial modified methionine residue in some cases as a result of host mediated processes.

In addition antibodies of the present invention may bind C3a Receptor proteins that have been chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art e.g. see Creighton Proteins Structures and Molecular Principles W.H. Freeman Co. N.Y. 1983 and Hunkapiller et al. 310 105 111 1984 . For example a peptide corresponding to a fragment of a C3a Receptor be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore if desired nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the C3a Receptor polypeptide sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to to the D isomers of the common amino acids 2 4 diaminobutyric acid a amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 amino butyric acid g Abu e Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionic acid omithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline homocitrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine b alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as b methyl amino acids Ca methyl amino acids Na methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore the amino acid can be D dextrorotary or L levorotary .

The invention additionally encompasses antibodies that bind C3a Receptor polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation e.g. by glycosylation acetylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide trypsin chymotrypsin papain V8 protease NaBH acetylation formylation oxidation reduction metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin etc.

Additional post translational modifications to C3a Receptor polypeptides for example e.g. N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains processing of N terminal or C terminal ends attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone chemical modifications of N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains and addition or deletion of an N terminal methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label such as an enzymatic fluorescent isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein.

Also provided by the invention are antibodies that bind chemically modified derivatives of C3a Receptor polypeptide which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility stability and circulating time of the polypeptide or decreased immunogenicity see U.S. Pat. No. 4 179 337 . The chemical moieties for denivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol ethylene glycol propylene glycol copolymers carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one two three or more attached chemical moieties.

The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa the term about indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol some molecules will weigh more some less than the stated molecular weight for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used depending on the desired therapeutic profile e.g. the duration of sustained release desired the effects if any on biological activity the ease in handling the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog . For example the polyethylene glycol may have an average molecular weight of about 200 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 5500 6000 6500 7000 7500 8000 8500 9000 9500 10 000 10 500 11 000 11 500 12 000 12 500 13 000 13 500 14 000 14 500 15 000 15 500 16 000 16 500 17 000 17 500 18 000 18 500 19 000 19 500 20 000 25 000 30 000 35 000 40 000 50 000 55 000 60 000 65 000 70 000 75 000 80 000 85 000 90 000 95 000 or 100 000 kDa.

As noted above the polyethylene glycol may have a branched structure. Branched polyethylene glycols are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 643 575 Morpurgo et al 56 59 72 1996 Vorobjev et al. 18 2745 2750 1999 and Caliceti et al. 10 638 646 1999 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The polyethylene glycol molecules or other chemical moieties should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art e.g. EP 0 401 384 herein incorporated by reference coupling PEG to G CSF see also Malik et al. 20 1028 1035 1992 reporting pegylation of GM CSF using tresyl chloride . For example polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group such as a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N terminal amino acid residues those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C terminal amino acid residue. Sulfhydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group such as attachment at the N terminus or lysine group.

As suggested above polyethylene glycol may be attached to proteins via linkage to any of a number of amino acid residues. For example polyethylene glycol can be linked to a protein via covalent bonds to lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid or cysteine residues. One or more reaction chemistries may be employed to attach polyethylene glycol to specific amino acid residues e.g. lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid or cysteine of the protein or to more than one type of amino acid residue e.g. lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid cysteine and combinations thereof of the protein.

One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules by molecular weight branching etc. the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein or peptide molecules in the reaction mix the type of pegylation reaction to be performed and the method of obtaining the selected N terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N terminally pegylated preparation i.e. separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary may be by purification of the N terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups lysine versus the N terminal available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.

As indicated above pegylation of the proteins of the invention may be accomplished by any number of means. For example polyethylene glycol may be attached to the protein either directly or by an intervening linker. Linkerless systems for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in Delgado et al. 9 249 304 1992 Francis et al. 68 1 18 1998 U.S. Pat. No. 4 002 531 U.S. Pat. No. 5 349 052 WO 95 06058 and WO 98 32466 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

One system for attaching polyethylene glycol directly to amino acid residues of proteins without an intervening linker employs tresylated MPEG which is produced by the modification of monomethoxy polyethylene glycol MPEG using tresylchloride ClSOCHCF . Upon reaction of protein with tresylated MPEG polyethylene glycol is directly attached to amine groups of the protein. Thus the invention includes protein polyethylene glycol conjugates produced by reacting proteins of the invention with a polyethylene glycol molecule having a 2 2 2 trifluoreothane sulphonyl group.

Polyethylene glycol can also be attached to proteins using a number of different intervening linkers. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 612 460 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference discloses urethane linkers for connecting polyethylene glycol to proteins. Protein polyethylene glycol conjugates wherein the polyethylene glycol is attached to the protein by a linker can also be produced by reaction of proteins with compounds such as MPEG succinimidylsuccinate MPEG activated with 1 1 carbonyldiimidazole MPEG 2 4 5 trichloropenylcarbonate MPEG p nitrophenolcarbonate and various MPEG succinate derivatives. A number additional polyethylene glycol derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in WO 98 32466 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Pegylated protein products produced using the reaction chemistries set out herein are included within the scope of the invention.

The number of polyethylene glycol moieties attached to each C3a Receptor polypeptide i.e. the degree of substitution may also vary. For example the pegylated proteins of the invention may be linked on average to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 17 20 or more polyethylene glycol molecules. Similarly the average degree of substitution within ranges such as 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6 5 7 6 8 7 9 8 10 9 11 10 12 11 13 12 14 13 15 14 16 15 17 16 18 17 19 or 18 20 polyethylene glycol moieties per protein molecule. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed for example in Delgado et al. 9 249 304 1992 .

As mentioned the antibodies of the present invention may bind C3a Receptor polypeptides that are modified by either natural processes such as posttranslational processing or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. It will be appreciated that the same type of modification may be present in the same or varying degrees at several sites in a given C3a Receptor polypeptide. C3a Receptor polypeptides may be branched for example as a result of ubiquitination and they may be cyclic with or without branching. Cyclic branched and branched cyclic C3a Receptor polypeptides may result from posttranslation natural processes or may be made by synthetic methods. Modifications include acetylation acylation ADP ribosylation amidation covalent attachment of flavin covalent attachment of a heme moiety covalent attachment of a nucleotide or nucleotide derivative covalent attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative covalent attachment of phosphotidylinositol cross linking cyclization disulfide bond formation demethylation formation of covalent cross links formation of cysteine formation of pyroglutamate formylation gamma carboxylation glycosylation GPI anchor formation hydroxylation iodination methylation myristoylation oxidation pegylation proteolytic processing phosphorylation prenylation racemization selenoylation sulfation transfer RNA mediated addition of amino acids to proteins such as arginylation and ubiquitination.

In a preferred embodiment one or more of these combinations are from the same antibody as disclosed in Table 1. Molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of fragments or variants of these antibodies that specifically bind to C3a Receptor are also encompassed by the invention as are nucleic acid molecules encoding these antibodies molecules fragments or variants.

The present invention also provides for nucleic acid molecules generally isolated encoding an antibody of the invention including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof .

In a specific embodiment a nucleic acid molecule of the invention encodes an antibody including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof comprising or alternatively consisting of a VH domain having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VH domains referred to in Table 1 and a VL domain having an amino acid sequence of VL domain referred to in Table 1. In another embodiment a nucleic acid molecule of the invention encodes an antibody including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof comprising or alternatively consisting of a VH domain having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VH domains referred to in Table I or a VL domain having an amino acid sequence of a VL domain referred to in Table 1.

The present invention also provides antibodies that comprise or alternatively consist of variants including derivatives of the antibody molecules e.g. the VH domains and or VL domains described herein which antibodies specifically bind to C3a Receptor or fragment or variant thereof. Standard techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to introduce mutations in the nucleotide sequence encoding a molecule of the invention including for example site directed mutagenesis and PCR mediated mutagenesis which result in amino acid substitutions. Preferably the variants including derivatives encode less than 50 amino acid substitutions less than 40 amino acid subsitutions less than 30 amino acid substitutions less than 25 amino acid substitutions less than 20 amino acid substitutions less than 15 amino acid substitutions less than 10 amino acid substitutions less than 5 amino acid substitutions less than 4 amino acid substitutions less than 3 amino acid substitutions or less than 2 amino acid substitutions relative to the reference VH domain VHCDR1 VHCDR2 VHCDR3 VL domain VLCDR1 VLCDR2 or VLCDR3. A conservative amino acid substitution is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with a similar charge. Families of amino acid residues having side chains with similar charges have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains e.g. lysine arginine histidine acidic side chains e.g. aspartic acid glutamic acid uncharged polar side chains e.g. glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine cysteine nonpolar side chains e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan beta branched side chains e.g. threonine valine isoleucine and aromatic side chains e.g. tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan histidine . Alternatively mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of the coding sequence such as by saturation mutagenesis and the resultant mutants can be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity e.g. the ability to induce resistance to cellular insulin and or glucose uptake .

For example it is possible to introduce mutations only in framework regions or only in CDR regions of an antibody molecule. Introduced mutations may be silent or neutral missense mutations i.e. have no or little effect on an antibody s ability to bind antigen. These types of mutations may be useful to optimize codon usage or improve a hybridoma s antibody production. Alternatively non neutral missense mutations may alter an antibody s ability to bind antigen. The location of most silent and neutral missense mutations is likely to be in the framework regions while the location of most non neutral missense mutations is likely to be in CDR though this is not an absolute requirement. One of skill in the art would be able to design and test mutant molecules with desired properties such as no alteration in antigen binding activity or alteration in binding activity e.g improvements in antigen binding activity or change in antibody specificity . Following mutagenesis the encoded protein may routinely be expressed and the functional and or biological activity of the encoded protein e.g. ability to specifically bind C3a Receptor can be determined using techniques described herein or by routinely modifying techniques known in the art.

In a specific embodiment an antibody of the invention including a molecule comprising or alternatively consisting of an antibody fragment or variant thereof that specifically binds C3a Receptor polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof comprises or alternatively consists of an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to that encoding one of the VH or VL domains referred to in Table 1 under stringent conditions e.g. hybridization to filter bound DNA in 6 sodium chloride sodium citrate SSC at about 45 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.2 SSC 0.1 SDS at about 50 65 C. under highly stringent conditions e.g. hybridization to filter bound nucleic acid in 6 SSC at about 45 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.1 SSC 0.2 SDS at about 68 C. or under other stringent hybridization conditions which are known to those of skill in the art see for example Ausubel F. M. et al. eds. 1989 Vol. 1 Green Publishing Associates Inc. and John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at pages 6.3.1 6.3.6 and 2.10.3 . Nucleic acid molecules encoding these antibodies are also encompassed by the invention.

It is well known within the art that polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof with similar amino acid sequences often have similar structure and many of the same biological activities. Thus in one embodiment an antibody including a molecule comprising or alternatively consisting of an antibody fragment or variant thereof that specifically binds to a C3a Receptor polypeptide or fragments or variants of a C3a Receptor polypeptide comprises or alternatively consists of a VH domain having an amino acid sequence that is at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 99 identical to the amino acid sequence of a VH domain referred to in Table 1.

In another embodiment an antibody including a molecule comprising or alternatively consisting of an antibody fragment or variant thereof that specifically binds to a C3a Receptor polypeptide or fragments or variants of a C3a Receptor polypeptide comprises or alternatively consists of a VL domain having an amino acid sequence that is at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 99 identical to the amino acid sequence of a VL domain referred to in Table 1.

Antibodies in accordance with the invention are preferably prepared utilizing a phage scFv display library. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are disclosed in the patents applications and references disclosed herein.

In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular DNA sequences encoding VH and VL domains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries e.g. human cDNA libraries of lymphoid tissues or synthetic CDNA libraries. The DNA encoding the VH and VL domains are joined together by an scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector e.g. p CANTAB 6 or pComb 3 HSS . The vector is electroporated in and the is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 and the VH and VL domains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to an antigen of interest i.e. a C3a Receptor polypeptide or a fragment thereof can be selected or identified with antigen e.g. using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include but are not limited to those disclosed in Brinkman et al. J. Immunol. Methods 182 41 50 1995 Ames et al. J. Immunol. Methods 184 177 186 1995 Kettleborough et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 24 952 958 1994 Persic et al. Gene 187 9 18 1997 Burton et al.

For some uses such as for in vitro affinity maturation of an antibody of the invention it may be useful to express the VH and VL domains of one or more scFvs referred to in Table 1 as single chain antibodies or Fab fragments in a phage display library. For example the cDNAs encoding the VH and VL domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 1 may be expressed in all possible combinations using a phage display library allowing for the selection of VH VL combinations that bind C3a Receptor polypeptides with preferred binding characteristics such as improved affinity or improved off rates. Additionally VH and VL domains the CDR regions of the VH and VL domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 1 in particular may be mutated in vitro. Expression of VH and VL domains with mutant CDRs in a phage display library allows for the selection of VH VL combinations that bind C3a Receptor polypeptides with preferred binding characteristics such as improved affinity or improved off rates.

Antibodies of the invention including antibody fragments or variants can be produced by any method known in the art. For example it will be appreciated that antibodies in accordance with the present invention can be expressed in cell lines including but not limited to myeloma cell lines and hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding the cDNAs or genomic clones for the particular antibodies can be used for transformation of a suitable mammalian or nonmammalian host cells or to generate phage display libraries for example. Additionally polypeptide antibodies of the invention may be chemically synthesized or produced through the use of recombinant expression systems.

One way to produce the antibodies of the invention would be to clone the VH and or VL domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 1. In order to isolate the VH and VL domains from bacteria transfected with a vector containing the scFv PCR primers complementary to VH or VL nucleotide sequences See Example 2 may be used to amplify the VH and VL sequences. The PCR products may then be cloned using vectors for example which have a PCR product cloning site consisting of a 5 and 3 single T nucleotide overhang that is complementary to the overhanging single adenine nucleotide added onto the 5 and 3 end of PCR products by many DNA polymerases used for PCR reactions. The VH and VL domains can then be sequenced using conventional methods known in the art. Alternatively the VH and VL domains may be amplified using vector specific primers designed to amplify the entire scFv i.e. the VH domain linker and VL domain. 

The cloned VH and VL genes may be placed into one or more suitable expression vectors. By way of non limiting example PCR primers including VH or VL nucleotide sequences a restriction site and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site may be used to amplify the VH or VL sequences. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art the PCR amplified VH domains may be cloned into vectors expressing the appropriate immunoglobulin constant region e.g. the human IgG1 or IgG4 constant region for VH domains and the human kappa or lambda constant regions for kappa and lambda VL domains respectively. Preferably the vectors for expressing the VH or VL domains comprise a promoter suitable to direct expression of the heavy and light chains in the chosen expression system a secretion signal a cloning site for the immunoglobulin variable domain immunoglobulin constant domains and a selection marker such as neomycin. The VH and VL domains may also be cloned into a single vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full length antibodies e.g. IgG using techniques known to those of skill in the art See for example Guo et al. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 82 925 31 1997 and Ames et al. J. Immunol. Methods 184 177 86 1995 which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference .

The invention provides polynucleotides comprising or alternatively consisting of a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof . The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under high stringency or alternatively under intermediate or lower stringency hybridization conditions e.g. as defined supra to polynucleotides complementary to nucleic acids having a polynucleotide sequence that encodes an antibody of the invention or a fragment or variant thereof.

The polynucleotides may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art. If the amino acid sequences of the VH domains VL domains and CDRs thereof are known nucleotide sequences encoding these antibodies can be determined using methods well known in the art ie. the nucleotide codons known to encode the particular amino acids are assembled in such a way to generate a nucleic acid that encodes the antibody of the invention. Such a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. BioTechniques 17 242 1994 which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Alternatively a polynucleotide encoding an antibody including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or a cDNA library generated from or nucleic acid preferably poly A RNA isolated from any tissue or cells expressing the antibody such as hybridoma cells or Epstein Barr virus transformed B cell lines that express an antibody of the invention by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify e.g. a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.

Once the nucleotide sequence of the antibody including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof is determined the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences e.g. recombinant DNA techniques site directed mutagenesis PCR etc. see for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence for example to create amino acid substitutions deletions and or insertions.

In a specific embodiment VH and VL domains of antibodies of the invention e.g. those referred to in Table 1 or fragments or variants thereof are inserted within framework regions using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. In a specific embodiment one two three four five six or more of the CDRs of antibodies of the invention e.g. those referred to in Table 1 or fragments or variants thereof is inserted within framework regions using recombinant DNA techniques known in the art. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions and preferably human framework regions see e.g. Chothia et al. J. Mol. Biol. 278 457 479 1998 for a listing of human framework regions the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . Preferably the polynucleotides generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encode an antibody including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof that specifically binds to C3a Receptor. Preferably as discussed supra polynucleotides encoding variants of antibodies or antibody fragments having one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions and preferably the amino acid substitutions do not significantly alter binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules or antibody fragments or variants lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and fall within the ordinary skill of the art.

The ability to clone and reconstruct megabase sized human loci in YACs and to introduce them into the mouse germline provides a powerful approach to elucidating the functional components of very large or crudely mapped loci as well as generating useful models of human disease. Furthermore the utilization of such technology for substitution of mouse loci with their human equivalents could provide unique insights into the expression and regulation of human gene products during development their communication with other systems and their involvement in disease induction and progression.

An important practical application of such a strategy is the humanization of the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human immunoglobulin Ig loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated offers the opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying programmed expression and assembly of antibodies as well as their role in B cell development. Furthermore such a strategy could provide an ideal source for production of fully human monoclonal antibodies Mabs an important milestone towards fulfilling the promise of antibody therapy in human disease.

Fully human antibodies are expected to minimize the immunogenic and allergic responses intrinsic to mouse or mouse derivatized Monoclonal antibodies and thus to increase the efficacy and safety of the administered antibodies. The use of fully human antibodies can be expected to provide a substantial advantage in the treatment of chronic and recurring human diseases such as cancer which require repeated antibody administrations.

One approach towards this goal was to engineer mouse strains deficient in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci in anticipation that such mice would produce a large repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of mouse antibodies. Large human Ig fragments would preserve the large variable gene diversity as well as the proper regulation of antibody production and expression. By exploiting the mouse machinery for antibody diversification and selection and the lack of immunological tolerance to human proteins the reproduced human antibody repertoire in these mouse strains should yield high affinity antibodies against any antigen of interest including human antigens. Using the hybridoma technology antigen specific human Monoclonal antibodies with the desired specificity could be readily produced and selected.

This general strategy was demonstrated in connection with the generation of the first XenoMouse strains as published in 1994. See Green et al. 7 13 21 1994 . The XenoMouse strains were engineered with yeast artificial chromosomes YACS containing germline configuration fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus respectively which contained core variable and constant region sequences. Id. The human Ig containing YACs proved to be compatible with the mouse system for both rearrangement and expression of antibodies and were capable of substituting for the inactivated mouse Ig genes. This was demonstrated by their ability to induce B cell development to produce an adult like human repertoire of fully human antibodies and to generate antigen specific human monoclonal antibodies. These results also suggested that introduction of larger portions of the human Ig loci containing greater numbers of V genes additional regulatory elements and human Ig constant regions might recapitulate substantially the full repertoire that is characteristic of the human humoral response to infection and immunization. The work of Green et al. was recently extended to the introduction of greater than approximately 80 of the human antibody repertoire through introduction of megabase sized germline configuration YAC fragments of the human heavy chain loci and kappa light chain loci respectively to produce XenoMouse mice.

Human anti mouse antibody HAMA responses have led the industry to prepare chimeric or otherwise humanized antibodies. While chimeric antibodies have a human constant region and a murine variable region it is expected that certain human anti chimeric antibody HACA responses will be observed particularly in chronic or multi dose utilizations of the antibody. Thus it would be desirable to provide fully human antibodies against C3a Receptor polypeptides in order to vitiate concerns and or effects of HAMA or HACA responses.

Monoclonal antibodies specific for C3a Receptor polypeptides were prepared using hybridoma technology. Kohler et al. Nature 256 495 1975 Kohler et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 6 511 1976 Kohler et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 6 292 1976 Hammerling et al. in Monoclonal Antibodies and T Cell Hybridomas Elsevier N.Y. pp. 571 681 1981 . Briefly XenoMouse mice were immunized with C3a Receptor polypeptides. After immunization the splenocytes of such mice were extracted and fused with a suitable myeloma cell line. Any suitable myeloma cell line may be employed in accordance with the present invention however it is preferable to employ the parent myeloma cell line SP2O available from the ATCC. After fusion the resulting hybridoma cells are selectively maintained in HAT medium and then cloned by limiting dilution as described by Wands et al. Gastroenterology 80 225 232 1981 . The hybridoma cells obtained through such a selection are then assayed to identify clones which secrete antibodies capable of binding the C3a Receptor polypetides.

For some uses including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays it may be preferable to use human or chimeric antibodies. Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 444 887 and 4 716 111 and PCT publications WO 98 46645 WO 98 50435 WO 98 24893 WO 98 16654 WO 96 34096 WO 96 35735 and WO 91 10741 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In a specific embodiment antibodies of the present invention comprise one or more VH and VL domains of the invention and constant regions from another immunoglobulin molecule preferably a human immunoglobulin molecule. In a specific embodiment antibodies of the present invention comprise one or more CDRs corresponding to the VH and VL domains of the invention and framework regions from another immunoglobulin molecule preferably a human immunoglobulin molecule. In other embodiments an antibody of the present invention comprises one two three four five six or more VL CDRs or VH CDRs of the scFvs referred to in Table 1 or fragments or variants thereof and framework regions and optionally one or more CDRs not present in the antibodies expressed by scFvs referred to in Table 1 from a human immunoglobulin molecule. In a preferred embodiment an antibody of the present invention comprises a VH CDR3 VL CDR3 or both corresponding to the same scFv or different scFvs selected from the scFvs referred to in Table 1 or fragments or variants thereof and framework regions from a human immunoglobulin.

A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different immunoglobulin molecules such as antibodies having a human variable region and a non human e.g. murine immunoglobulin constant region or vice versa. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison Science 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. BioTechniques 4 214 1986 Gillies et al. J. Immunol. Methods 125 191 202 1989 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 807 715 4 816 567 and 4 816 397 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Chimeric antibodies comprising one or more CDRs from human species and framework regions from a non human immunoglobulin molecule e.g. framework regions from a murine canine or feline immunoglobulin molecule or vice versa can be produced using a variety of techniques known in the art including for example CDR grafting EP 239 400 PCT publication WO 91 09967 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 225 539 5 530 101 and 5 585 089 veneering or resurfacing EP 592 106 EP 519 596 Padlan Molecular Immunology 28 4 5 489 498 1991 Studnicka et al. Protein Engineering 7 6 805 814 1994 Roguska et al PNAS 91 969 973 1994 and chain shuffling U.S. Pat. No. 5 565 352 . In a preferred embodiment chimeric antibodies comprise a human CDR3 having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VH CDR3s or VL CDR3s referred to in Table 1 or a variant thereof and non human framework regions or human framework regions different from those of the frameworks expressed by the corresponding scFvs disclosed in Table 1. Often framework residues in the framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 Riechmann et al. Nature 352 323 1988 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. 

Intrabodies are antibodies often scFvs that are expressed from a recombinant nucleic acid molecule and engineered to be retained intracellularly e.g. retained in the cytoplasm endoplasmic reticulum or periplasm . Intrabodies may be used for example to ablate the function of a protein to which the intrabody binds. The expression of intrabodies may also be regulated through the use of inducible promoters in the nucleic acid expression vector comprising the intrabody. Intrabodies of the invention can be produced using methods known in the art such as those disclosed and reviewed in Chen et al. 5 595 601 1994 Marasco W. A. 4 11 15 1997 Rondon and Marasco 51 257 283 1997 Proba et al. 275 245 253 1998 Cohen et al. 17 2445 2456 1998 Ohage and Steipe 291 1119 1128 1999 Ohage et al. 291 1129 1134 1999 Wirtz and Steipe 8 2245 2250 1999 Zhu et al. 231 207 222 1999 and references cited therein.

Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention including antibody fragments or variants thereof e.g. a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention requires construction of an expression vector s containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule e.g. a whole antibody a heavy or light chain of an antibody or portion thereof preferably but not necessarily containing the heavy or light chain variable domain of the invention has been obtained the vector s for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention e.g. a whole antibody a heavy or light chain of an antibody a heavy or light chain variable domain of an antibody or a portion thereof or a heavy or light chain CDR a single chain Fv or fragments or variants thereof operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule see e.g. PCT Publication WO 86 05807 PCT Publication WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy chain the entire light chain or both the entire heavy and light chains.

The expression vector s is are transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing polynucleotide s encoding an antibody of the invention e.g. whole antibody a heavy or light chain thereof or portion thereof or a single chain antibody or a fragment or variant thereof operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of entire antibody molecules vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule as detailed below.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to bacteriophage particles engineered to express antibody fragments or variants thereof single chain antibodies microorganisms such as bacteria eg. transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing antibody coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing antibody coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. NSO COS CHO BHK 293 and 3T3 cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter . Preferably bacterial cells such as and more preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant antib molecule are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies Foecking et al. Gene 45 101 1986 Cockett et al. Bio Technology 8 2 1990 Bebbington et al. Bio Techniques 10 169 1992 Keen and Hale Cytotechnology 18 207 1996 .

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al EMBO 1. 2 1791 1983 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye Nucleic Acids Res. 13 3101 3109 1985 Van Heeke Schuster J. Biol. Chem. 24 5503 5509 1989 and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione 5 transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV may be used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. Antibody coding sequences may be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts e.g. see Logan Shenk Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 8 1 355 359 1984 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see e.g. Bittner et al. Methods in Enzymol. 153 51 544 1987 .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications eg. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such manmmalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK Hela COS NSO MDCK 293 3T3 and W138.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express the antibody may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compositions that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. Cell 11 223 1977 hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48 202 1992 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. Cell 22 8 17 1980 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 357 1980 O Hare et al.

Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone and such methods are described for example in Ausubel et al. eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY 1993 Kriegler Gene Transfer and Expression A Laboratory Manual Stockton Press NY 1990 and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds Current Protocols in Human Genetics John Wiley Sons NY 1994 Colberre Garapin et al.

The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in Vol.3. Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the coding sequence of the antibody production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3 257 1983 .

Vectors which use glutamine synthase GS or DHFR as the selectable markers can be amplified in the presence of the drugs methionine sulphoximine or methotrexate respectively. An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors are the availabilty of cell lines e.g. the murine myeloma cell line NSO which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene. A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications WO87 04462 WO86 05807 WO89 01036 WO89 10404 and WO91 06657 which are incorporated in their entireties by reference herein. Additionally glutamine synthase expression vectors that may be used according to the present invention are commercially available from suppliers including for example Lonza Biologics Inc. Portsmouth N.H. . Expression and production of monoclonal antibodies using a GS expression system in murine myeloma cells is described in Bebbington et al. 10 169 1992 and in Biblia and Robinson 11 1 1995 which are incorporated in their entirities by reference herein.

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes and is capable of expressing both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain is preferably placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot Nature 322 52 1986 Kohler Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 2 197 1980 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Further the antibodies of the present invention may be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences described herein or otherwise known in the art to facilitate purification.

In specific embodiments antibodies of the invention are attached to macrocyclic chelators useful for conjugating radiometal ions including but not limited to 111In 177Lu 90Y 166Ho 153Sm 215Bi and 225Ac to polypeptides. In a preferred embodiment the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelators attached to antibodies of the invention is 111In. In another preferred embodiment the radiometal ion associated with the macrocyclic chelator attached to antibodies polypeptides of the invention is 90Y. In specific embodiments the macrocyclic chelator is 1 4 7 10 tetraazacyclododecane N N N N tetraacetic acid DOTA . In specific embodiments the macrocyclic chelator is 5 isothiocyanato 2 methoxyphenyl 1 4 7 10 tetraaza cyclododecane 1 4 7 10 tetraacetic acid. In other specific embodiments the DOTA is attached to the antibody of the invention via a linker molecule. Examples of linker molecules useful for conjugatinga macrocyclic chelator such as DOTA to a polypeptide are commonly known in the art see for example DeNardo et al. Clin Cancer Res. 4 10 2483 90 1998 Peterson et al. Bioconjug. Chem. 10 4 553 7 1999 and Zimmerman et al Nucl. Med. Biol. 26 8 943 50 1999 which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In addition U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 652 361 and 5 756 065 which disclose chelating agents that may be conjugated to antibodies and methods for making and using them are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.

In one embodiment antibodies of the invention are labeled with biotin. In other related embodiments biotinylated antibodies of the invention may be used for example as an imaging agent or as a means of identifying one or more TRAIL receptor coreceptor or ligand molecules.

Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of antibodies of the invention which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility stability and in vivo or in vitro circulating time of the polypeptide or decreased immunogenicity see U.S. Pat. No. 4 179 337 . The chemical moieties for derivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol ethylene glycol propylene glycol copolymers carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The antibodies may be modified at random positions within the molecule or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one two three or more attached chemical moieties.

The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa the term about indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol some molecules will weigh more some less than the stated molecular weight for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used depending on the desired therapeutic profile e.g. the duration of sustained release desired the effects if any on biological activity the ease in handling the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog . For example the polyethylene glycol may have an average molecular weight of about 200 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 5000 5500 6000 6500 7000 7500 8000 8500 9000 9500 10 000 10 500 11 000 11 500 12 000 12 500 13 000 13 500 14 000 14 500 15 000 15 500 16 000 16 500 17 000 17 500 18 000 18 500 19 000 19 500 20 000 25 000 30 000 35 000 40 000 50 000 55 000 60 000 65 000 70 000 75 000 80 000 85 000 90 000 95 000 or 100 000 kDa.

As noted above the polyethylene glycol may have a branched structure. Branched polyethylene glycols are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 643 575 Morpurgo et al. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 56 59 72 1996 Vorobjev et al. Nucleosides Nucleotides 18 2745 2750 1999 and Caliceti et al. Bioconjug. Chem. 10 638 646 1999 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The polyethylene glycol molecules or other chemical moieties should be attached to the antibody with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the antibody. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art e.g. EP 0 401 384 herein incorporated by reference coupling PEG to G CSF see also Malik et al. Exp. Hematol. 20 1028 1035 1992 reporting pegylation of GM CSF using tresyl chloride . For example polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group such as a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include for example lysine residues and the N terminal amino acid residues those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C terminal amino acid residue. Sulthydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group such as attachment at the N terminus or lysine group.

As suggested above polyethylene glycol may be attached to proteins e.g. antibodies via linkage to any of a number of amino acid residues. For example polyethylene glycol can be linked to a proteins via covalent bonds to lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid or cysteine residues. One or more reaction chemistries may be employed to attach polyethylene glycol to specific amino acid residues e.g. lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid or cysteine of the protein or to more than one type of amino acid residue e.g. lysine histidine aspartic acid glutamic acid cysteine and combinations thereof of the protein.

One may specifically desire antibodies chemically modified at the N terminus of either the heavy chain or the light chain or both. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules by molecular weight branching etc. the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein or peptide molecules in the reaction mix the type of pegylation reaction to be performed and the method of obtaining the selected N terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N terminally pegylated preparation i.e. separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary may be by purification of the N terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective chemical modification at the N terminus may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups lysine versus the N terminal available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.

As indicated above pegylation of the antibodies of the invention may be accomplished by any number of means. For example polyethylene glycol may be attached to the antibody either directly or by an intervening linker. Linkerless systems for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in Delgado et al. Crit. Rev. Thera. Drug Carrier Sys. 9 249 304 1992 Francis et al. Intern J. of Hematol. 68 1 18 1998 U.S. Pat. No. 4 002 531 U.S. Pat. No. 5 349 052 WO 95 06058 and WO 98 32466 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

One system for attaching polyethylene glycol directly to amino acid residues of antibodies without an intervening linker employs tresylated MPEG which is produced by the modification of monmethoxy polyethylene glycol MPEG using tresylchloride ClSO2CH2CF3 . Upon reaction of protein with tresylated MPEG polyethylene glycol is directly attached to amine groups of the protein. Thus the invention includes antibody polyethylene glycol conjugates produced by reacting antibodies of the invention with a polyethylene glycol molecule having a 2 2 2 trifluoreothane sulphonyl group.

Polyethylene glycol can also be attached to antibodies using a number of different intervening linkers. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 612 460 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference discloses urethane linkers for connecting polyethylene glycol to proteins. Antibody polyethylene glycol conjugates wherein the polyethylene glycol is attached to the antibody by a linker can also be produced by reaction of antibodies with compounds such as MPEG succinimidylsuccinate MPEG activated with 1 1 carbonyidiimidazole MPEG 2 4 5 trichloropenylcarbonate MPEG p nitrophenolcarbonate and various MPEG succinate derivatives. A number additional polyethylene glycol derivatives and reaction chemistries for attaching polyethylene glycol to proteins are described in WO 98 32466 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Pegylated antibody products produced using the reaction chemistries set out herein are included within the scope of the invention.

The number of polyethylene glycol moieties attached to each antibody of the invention i.e. the degree of substitution may also vary. For example the pegylated antibodies of the invention may be linked on average to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 12 15 17 20 or more polyethylene glycol molecules. Similarly the average degree of substitution within ranges such as 1 3 2 4 3 5 4 6 5 7 6 8 7 9 8 10 9 11 10 12 11 13 12 14 13 15 14 16 15 17 16 18 17 19 or 18 20 polyethylene glycol moieties per antibody molecule. Methods for determining the degree of substitution are discussed for example in Delgado et al. Crit. Rev. Thera. Drug Carrier Sys. 9 249 304 1992 .

Antibodies of the present invention including antibody fragments or variants thereof may be characterized in a variety of ways. In particular antibodies and related molecules of the invention may be assayed for the ability to specifically bind to C3a Recepto polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof using techniques described herein or routinely modifying techniques known in the art. Assays for the ability of the antibodies of the invention to specifically bind C3a Receptor polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof may be performed in solution e.g. Houghten Bio Techniques 13 412421 1992 on beads e.g. Lam Nature 354 82 84 1991 on chips e.g. Fodor Nature 364 555 556 1993 on bacteria e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 223 409 on spores e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 698 5 403 484 and 5 223 409 on plasmids e.g. Cull et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 1865 1869 1992 or on phage e.g. Scott and Smith Science 249 386 390 1990 Devlin Science 249 404 406 1990 Cwirla et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 7178 7182 1990 and Felici J. Mol.

Such assays may be used to identify antibodies that specifically bind to C3a Receptor polypeptides or a fragment or variant of a C3a Receptor polypeptide.

The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for specific binding to C3a Receptor polypeptides and cross reactivity with other antigens by any method known in the art. Inmuunoassays which can be used to analyze specific binding and cross reactivity include but are not limited to competitive and noncompetitive assay systems using techniques such as BIAcore analysis FACS fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis immunofluorescence immunocytochemistry radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays western blots precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays and protein A immunoassays to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below but are not intended by way of limitation .

ELISAs comprise preparing antigen coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen washing away antigen that did not bind the wells adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase to the wells and incubating for a period of time washing away unbound antibodies or non specifically bound antibodies and detecting the presence of the antibodies specifically bound to the antigen coating the well. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound instead a second antibody which recognizes the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Alternatively the antigen need not be directly coated to the well instead the ELISA plates may be coated with an anti Ig Fc antibody and the antigen in the form of a C3a Receptor Fc fusion protein may be bound to the anti Ig Fc coated to the plate. This may be desirable so as to maintain the antigen protein e.g. the C3a Receptor polypeptides in a more native conformation than it may have when it is directly coated to a plate. In another alternative instead of coating the well with the antigen the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case the detectable molecule could be the antigen conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase . One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 11.2.1.

The binding affinity of an antibody including an scFv or other molecule comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof to an antigen and the off rate of an antibody antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen e.g. antigen labeled with H or I or fragment or variant thereof with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of the present invention for C3a Receptor and the binding off rates can be determined from the data by Scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case C3a Receptor polypeptide is incubated with an antibody of the present invention conjugated to a labeled compound e.g. compound labeled with H or I in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second anti C3a Receptor antibody. This kind of competitive assay between two antibodies may also be used to determine if two antibodies bind the same closely associated e.g. overlapping or different epitopes.

The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by e.g. western blot analysis.

By biological sample is intended any fluids and or cells obtained from an individual body fluid body tissue body cell cell line tissue culture or other source which may contain a C3a Receptor polypeptide protein or mRNA. Body fluids include but are not limited to sera plasma urine saliva mucous pleural fluid synovial fluid and spinal fluid. Tissues samples may be taken from virtually any tissue in the body. Tissue samples may also be obtained from autopsy material. Methods for obtaining tissue biopsies and body fluids from mammals are well known in the art. Where the biological sample is to include mRNA a tissue biopsy is the preferred source.

One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or a C3a Receptor polypeptide in an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment diagnosis comprises a administering for example parenterally subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to a subject an effective amount of a labeled antibody of the invention including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof that specifically binds to a C3a Receptor polypeptide b waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled antibody to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where C3a Receptor polypeptide is expressed and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level c determining background level and d detecting the labeled antibody in the subject such that detection of labeled antibody or fragment thereof above the background level and above or below the level observed in a person without the disease or disorder indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a C3a Receptor polypeptide or a C3a Receptor polypeptide. Background level can be determined by various methods including comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.

It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety for a human subject the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 milliCuries of Tc. The labeled antibody will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al.

The treatment and or prevention of diseases disorders or conditions includes but is not limited to alleviating symptoms associated with those diseases disorders or conditions. Antibodies of the invention may be provided in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions as known in the art or as described herein.

Members of the C3a Receptor family of proteins are believed to be involved in biological activities associated with the inflammatory response. Accordingly antibodies of the invention including fragments variants and fusion proteins thereof especially neutralizing or antagonistic antibodies may be used in the diagnosis prognosis prevention and or treatment of diseases and or disorders associated with inappropriate or excessive inflammation.

In a specific embodiment the present invention encomapsses a method for inhibiting C3a Receptor mediated inflammation which involves administering to a cell or animal an effective amount of an antibody of the invention capable of decreasing C3a Receptor mediated signaling.

In specific embodiments antibodies of the invention are useful to treat diagnose and or prevent organ transplant rejections and graft versus host disease. Organ rejection occurs by host immune cell destruction of the transplanted tissue through an immune response. Similarly an immune response is also involved in GVHD but in this case the foreign transplanted immune cells destroy the host tissues. Polypeptides antibodies or polynucleotides of the invention and or agonists or antagonists thereof that inhibit an immune response particularly the activation proliferation differentiation or chemotaxis of T cells may be an effective therapy in preventing organ rejection or GVHD. In specific embodiments polypeptides antibodies or polynucleotides of the invention and or agonist or antagonists thereof that inhibit an immune response particularly the activation proliferation differentiation or chemotaxis of T cells may be an effective therapy in preventing experimental allergic and hyperacute xenograft rejection.

Because inflammation is a fundamental bodily defense mechanism antibodies of the invention including fragments variants and fusion proteins thereof especially neutralizing or antagonistic antibodies are likely to have uses in a wide range of inflammatory disorders. Therefore the above mentioned biological activities are not intended to be limiting.

Antibodies of the invention including fragments variants and fusion proteins thereof may work to modulate chemotactic activity of C3A Receptor expressing cells. A chemotactic molecule attracts or mobilizes cells e.g. mast cells eosinophils monocytes fibrblasts neutrophils T cells epithelial and or endothelial cells to a particular site in the body such as inflammation infection or site of hyperproliferation. The mobilized cells can then fight off and or heal the particular trauma or abnormality.

Antibodies of the invention including fragments variants and fusion proteins thereof may modulate chemotactic activity of C3a Receptor expressing cells. For example antagonistic anti C3A Receptor antibodies may decrease chemotaxis of C3a Receptor expressing cells while agonistic anti C3A Receptor antibodies may induce or enhance chemotaxis of C3a Receptor expressing cells. Such antibodies that modulate the chemotactic activity of C3a Receptor expressing cells may be used to treat inflammation infection hyperproliferative disorders or other immune system disorders by influencing the number of cells targeted to or away from a particular location in the body. For example agonistic anti C3a Receptor antibodies can be used to treat wounds and other trauma to tissues by attracting immune cells to the injured location.

Antibodies of the invention including fragments variants and fusion proteins thereof may be useful in treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases disorders and or conditions of the immune system by for example activating or inhibiting the proliferation differentiation or mobilization chemotaxis of immune cells. Immune cells develop through a process called hematopoiesis producing myeloid platelets red blood cells neutrophils and macrophages and lymphoid B and T lymphocytes Y cells from pluripotent stem cells. The etiology of these immune diseases disorders and or conditions may be genetic somatic such as cancer and some autoimmune diseases acquired e.g. by chemotherapy or toxins or infectious. Moreover polynucleotides polypeptides antibodies and or agonists or antagonists of the present invention can be used as a marker or detector of a particular immune system disease or disorder.

Antibodies of the invention including fragments variants and fusion proteins thereof may be useful in treating preventing and or diagnosing diseases disorders and or conditions of hematopoietic cells. Polynucleotides polypeptides antibodies and or agonists or antagonists of the present invention could be used to increase differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells including the pluripotent stem cells in an effort to treat or prevent those diseases disorders and or conditions associated with a decrease in certain or many types hematopoietic cells. Examples of immunologic deficiency syndromes include but are not limited to blood protein diseases disorders and or conditions e.g. agammaglobulinemia dysgammaglobulinemia ataxia telangiectasia common variable immunodeficiency Digeorge Syndrome HIV infection HTLV BLV infection leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome lymphopenia phagocyte bactericidal dysfunction severe combined immunodeficiency SCIDs Wiskott Aldrich Disorder anemia thrombocytopenia or hemoglobinuria.

Moreover antibodies of the invention including fragments variants and fusion proteins thereof could also be used to modulate hemostatic activity the stopping of bleeding or thrombolytic activity clot formation . For example by increasing hemostatic or thrombolytic activity polynucleotides or polypeptides and or agonists or antagonists of the present invention could be used to treat or prevent blood coagulation diseases disorders and or conditions e.g. afibrinogenemia factor deficiencies blood platelet diseases disorders and or conditions e.g. thrombocytopenia or wounds resulting from trauma surgery or other causes. Alternatively polynucleotides polypeptides antibodies and or agonists or antagonists of the present invention that can decrease hemostatic or thrombolytic activity could be used to inhibit or dissolve clotting. These molecules could be important in the treatment or prevention of heart attacks infarction strokes or scarring.

The antibodies of the invention including fragments variants and fusion proteins thereof especially neutralizing or antagonistic antibodies may be useful in treating preventing and or diagnosing autoimmune disorders.

The subject is preferably an animal including but not limited to animals such as cows pigs horses chickens cats dogs etc. and is preferably a mammal and most preferably a human.

Formulations and methods of administration that can be employed when the compound comprises a nucleic acid or an immunoglobulin are described above additional appropriate formulations and routes of administration can be selected from among those described herein below. The antibodies and or antibody compositions of the invention and or agonists or antagonists thereof is administered to the patient by any suitable technique including but not limited to parenteral sublingual topical intrapulmonary and intranasal and those techniques further discussed herein.

Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer an antibody of the invention or a fragment or variant thereof e.g. encapsulation in liposomes microparticles microcapsules recombinant cells capable of expressing the antibody or antibody fragment receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu and Wu J. Biol. Chem. 262 4429 4432 1987 construction of a nucleic acid as part of a retroviral or other vector etc. Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermnal intramuscular intraperitoneal intravenous subcutaneous intranasal epidural and oral routes. The compositions may be administered by any convenient route for example by infusion or bolus injection by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings e.g. oral mucosa rectal and intestinal mucosa etc. and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition it may be desirable to introduce the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention into the central nervous system by any suitable route including intraventricular and intrathecal injection intraventricular injection may be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter for example attached to a reservoir such as an Ommaya reservoir. Pulmonary administration can also be employed e.g. by use of an inhaler or nebulizer and formulation with an aerosolizing agent.

In a specific embodiment it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment this may be achieved by for example and not by way of limitation local infusion during surgery topical application e.g. in conjunction with a wound dressing after surgery by injection by means of a catheter by means of a suppository or by means of an implant said implant being of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes such as sialastic membranes or fibers. Preferably when administering a protein including an antibody of the invention care must be taken to use materials to which the protein does not absorb.

In another embodiment the composition can be delivered in a vesicle in particular a liposome see Langer Science 249 1527 1535 1990 Treat et a. in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer Lopez Berestein and Fidler eds. Liss New York pp. 353 365 1989 Lopez Berestein ibid. pp. 3 17 327 see generally ibid. .

In yet another embodiment the composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment a pump may be used see Langer supra Sefton CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14 20 1 1987 Buchwald et al. Surgery 88 507 1980 Saudek et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 321 574 1989 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used see Medical Applications of Controlled Release Langer and Wise eds. CRC Pres. Boca Raton Fla. 1974 Controlled Drug Bioavailability Drug Product Design and Performance Smolen and Ball eds. Wiley New York 1984 Ranger and Peppas J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23 71 1983 see also Levy et al. Science 228 190 1985 During et al. Ann. Neurol. 25 35 1 1989 Howard et al. J.Neurosurg. 7 1 105 1989 . In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target i.e. the brain thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 .

In a specific embodiment where the composition of the invention is a nucleic acid encoding an antibody the nucleic acid can be administered in vivo to promote expression of its encoded antibody by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular e.g. by use of a retroviral vector see U.S. Pat. No. 4 980 286 or by direct injection or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun Biolistic Dupont or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents or by administering it in linkage to a homeobox like peptide which is known to enter the nucleus see e.g. Joliot et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 1864 1868 1991 etc. Alternatively a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.

The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody or a fragment thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment the term pharmaceutically acceptable means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals and more particularly in humans. The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant excipient or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders sustained release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody or fragment thereof preferably in purified form together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.

In a preferred embodiment the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocamne to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form for example as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.

The compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric phosphoric acetic oxalic tartaric acids etc. and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium ferric hydroxides isopropylamine triethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine etc.

The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in the treatment inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the disease or disorder and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

For antibodies the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg kg to 100 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Preferably the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg kg and 20 mg kg of the patient s body weight more preferably 1 mg kg to 10 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Generally human antibodies have a longer half life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further the dosage and frequency of administration of therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration e.g. into the brain of the antibodies by modifications such as for example lipidation.

Generally administration of products of a species origin or species reactivity in the case of antibodies that is the same species as that of the patient is preferred. Thus in a preferred embodiment human antibodies fragments or variants e.g. derivatives or nucleic acids are administered to a human patient for therapy or prophylaxis.

It is preferred to use high affinity and or potent antibodies of the invention including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof that specifically bind to one or more C3a Receptor polypeptides or polynucleotides encoding antibodies that specifically bind to one or more C3a Receptor polypeptides for both immunoassays and therapy of disorders related to C3a Receptor polynucleotides or polypeptides including fragments thereof. Such antibodies will preferably have an affinity for C3a Receptor polypeptides and or C3a Receptor polypeptide fragments. Preferred binding affinities include those with a dissociation constant or Kof less than or equal to 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M or 10M. More preferably antibodies of the invention bind C3a Receptor polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof with a dissociation constant or Kless than or equal to 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M. Even more preferably antibodies of the invention bind C3a Receptor polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof with a dissociation constant or Kless than or equal to 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 M 10M 5 10M 10M 5 10M 10M. In a preferred embodiment antibodies of the invention inhibit proliferation differentiation activation chemotaxis degranulation and or apoptosis of C3a Receptor receptor expressing cells. In an additional preferred embodiment antibodies of the invention induce differentiation of C3a Receptor expressing cells.

The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment a kit comprises an antibody of the invention preferably a purified antibody in one or more containers. In an alterative embodiment a kit comprises an antibody fragment that specifically binds to C3a Receptor polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof. In a specific embodiment the kits of the present invention contain a substantially isolated C3a Receptor polypeptide or fragment or variant thereof as a control. Preferably the kits of the present invention further comprise a control antibody which does not react with any some or all C3a Receptor. In another specific embodiment the kits of the present invention contain a means for detecting the binding of an antibody to C3a Receptor polypeptides e.g. the antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate such as a fluorescent compound an enzymatic substrate a radioactive compound or a luminescent compound or a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate . In specific embodiments the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized C3a Receptor. The C3a Receptor provided in the kit may also be attached to a solid support. In a more specific embodiment the detecting means of the above described kit includes a solid support to which C3a Receptor is attached.

Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.

In a preferred aspect a composition of the invention comprises or alternatively consists of nucleic acids encoding an antibody said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular such nucleic acids have promoters preferably heterologous promoters operably linked to the antibody coding region said promoter being inducible or constitutive and optionally tissue specific. In another particular embodiment nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 . In specific embodiments the expressed antibody molecule is an scFv alternatively the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both the heavy and light chains or fragments or variants thereof of an antibody.

Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid carrying vectors or indirect in which case cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known respectively as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art e.g. by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular e.g. by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors see U.S. Patent No. 4 980 286 or by direct injection of naked DNA or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun Biolistic Dupont or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents encapsulation in liposomes microparticles or microcapsules or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu and Wu J. Biol. Chem. 262 4429 4432 1987 which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors etc. In another embodiment nucleic acid ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression by targeting a specific receptor see e.g. PCT Publications WO 92 06180 WO 92 22715 WO92 20316 WO93 14188 WO 93 20221 . Alternatively the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 .

In a specific embodiment viral vectors that contains nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention or fragments or variants thereof are used. For example a retroviral vector can be used see Miller et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 581 599 1993 . These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al. Biotherapy 6 29 1 302 1994 which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr 1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are Clowes et al. J. Clin. Invest. 93 644 651 1994 Klein et al. Blood 83 1467 1473 1994 Salmons and Gunzberg Human Gene Therapy 4 129 141 1993 and Grossman and Wilson Curr. Opin. in Genetics and Devel. 3 110 114 1993 .

Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus based delivery systems are liver the central nervous system endothelial cells and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3 499 503 1993 present a review of adenovirus based gene therapy. Bout et al. Human Gene Therapy 5 3 10 1994 demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al. Science 252 431 434 1991 Rosenfeld et al. Cell 68 143 155 1992 Mastrangeli et al. J. Clin. Invest. 91 225 234 1993 PCT Publication W094 12649 and Wang et al. Gene Therapy 2 775 783 1995 . In a preferred embodiment adenovirus vectors are used.

Adeno associated virus AAV has also been proposed for use in gene therapy Walsh et al. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204 289 300 1993 U.S. Pat. No. 5 436 146 .

Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation lipofection calcium phosphate mediated transfection or viral infection. Usually the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.

In this embodiment the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art including but not limited to transfection electroporation microinjection infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcellmediated gene transfer spheroplast fusion etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells see e.g. Loeffler and Behr Meth. Enzymol. 217 599 718 1993 Cohen et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 718 644 1993 Clin. Pharma. Ther. 29 69 92m 1985 and may be used in accordance with the present invention provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.

The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells e.g. hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect patient state etc. and can be determined by one skilled in the art.

Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired available cell type and include but are not limited to epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts muscle cells hepatocytes blood cells such as T lymphocytes B lymphocytes monocytes macrophages neutrophils cosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes various stem or progenitor cells in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells e.g. as obtained from bone marrow umbilical cord blood peripheral blood fetal liver etc.

In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or fragment thereof are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94 08598 Stemple and Anderson Cell 7 1 973 985 1992 Rheinwald Meth. Cell Bio. 21A 229 1980 and Pittelkow and Scott Mayo Clinic Proc. 71 771 1986 .

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.

A library of scFvs is constructed from the RNA of human PBLs as described in WO92 01047 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . To rescue phage displaying antibody fragments approximately 109 harboring the phagemid are used to inoculate 50 ml of 2 TY containing 1 glucose and 100 micrograms ml of ampicillin 2 TY AMP GLU and grown to an O.D. of 0.8 with shaking. Five ml of this culture is used to inoculate 50 ml of 2 TY AMP GLU 2 108 TU of delta gene 3 helper M13 delta gene III see WO92 01047 are added and the culture incubated at 37 C. for 45 minutes without shaking and then at 37 C. for 45 minutes with shaking. The culture is centrifuged at 4000 r.p.m. for 10 min. and the pellet resuspended in 2 liters of 2 TY containing 100 micrograms ml ampicillin and 50 micrograms ml kanamycin and grown overnight. Phage are prepared as described in WO92 01047.

M13 delta gene III is prepared as follows M13 delta gene III helper phage does not encode gene III protein hence the phage mid displaying antibody fragments have a greater avidity of binding to antigen. Infectious Ml 3 delta gene III particles are made by growing the helper phage in cells harboring a pUC19 derivative supplying the wild type gene III protein during phage morphogenesis. The culture is incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. without shaking and then for a further hour at 37 C. with shaking. Cells were spun down IEC Centra 8 4000 revs min for 10 min resuspended in 300 ml 2 TY broth containing 100 micrograms ampicillin ml and 25 micrograms kanamycin ml 2 TY AMP KAN and grown overnight shaking at 37 C. Phage particles are purified and concentrated from the culture medium by two PEG precipitations Sambrook et al. 1990 resuspended in 2 ml PBS and passed through a 0.45 micrometer filter Minisart NML Sartorius to give a final concentration of approximately 10transducing units ml ampicillin resistant clones .

Immunotubes Nunc are coated overnight in PBS with 4 ml of either 100 micrograms ml or 10 micrograms ml of a C3a Receptor receptor polypeptide. Tubes are blocked with 2 Marvel PBS for 2 hours at 37 C. and then washed 3 times in PBS. Approximately 1013 TU of phage is applied to the tube and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature tumbling on an over and under turntable and then left to stand for another 1.5 hours. Tubes are washed 10 times with PBS 0.1 Tween 20 and 10 times with PBS. Phage are eluted by adding 1 ml of 100 mM triethylamine and rotating 15 minutes on an under and over turntable after which the solution is immediately neutralized with 0.5 ml of 1.0M Tris HCl pH 7.4. Phage are then used to infect 10 ml of mid log TG1 by incubating eluted phage with bacteria for 30 minutes at 37 C. The are then plated on TYE plates containing 1 glucose and 100 micrograms ml ampicillin. The resulting bacterial library is then rescued with delta gene 3 helper phage as described above to prepare phage for a subsequent round of selection. This process is usually repeated for a total of 24 rounds of affinity purification.

Antigens that may be used to select for anti C3a Receptor antibodies from phage display libraries or other sources include but are not limited to peptides corresponding to all or portions of the extracellular domains of C3A receptor and chimeric versions of the C3a Receptor. Preferred peptides that may be used as an selection agent for the identification of antibodies reactive with C3a Receptor consist of or alternatively comprise amino acid residues 82 99 162 183 299 315 308 324 and or 315 331 of the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO 2. The central portion of the second extracellular loop is an immunodominant epitope of C3a Receptor that results in the generation of antibodies that do not inhibit C3a binding to C3a Receptor Hawlisch et al. 1998 The Journal of Immunology 160 2847 2958 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . Thus a preferred variant of C3a Receptor that may be used as an to select for antibodies reactive with C3a Receptor that inhibit C3a binding to C3a Receptor consists of or alternatively comprises a human murine C3a Receptor chimeric polypeptide in which amino acid residues 1 211 of human C3a Receptor SEQ ID NO 2 are fused to amino acids residues 215 to 304 of murine C3a Receptor SEQ ID NO 4 which is fused to amino acid residues 309 482 of SEQ ID NO 2. Another preferred variant of C3a Receptor that may be used to select for antibodies reactive with C3a Receptor that inhibit C3a binding to C3a Receptor consists of or alternatively comprises a human deletion mutant of C3a Receptor in which amino acids 212 308 of SEQ ID NO 2 are deleted resulting in the fusion of amino acid residues 1 211 of human C3a Receptor SEQ ID NO 2 to amino acid residues 309 482 of SEQ ID NO 2. The above described proteins may also be used in assays to characterize the binding sites of anti C3a Receptor antibodies.

Eluted phage from the final rounds of selection are used to infect HB 2151 and soluble scFv is produced Marks et al. 1991 from single colonies for assay. ELISAs are performed with microtiter plates coated with either 10 picograms ml of the polypeptide of the present invention in 50 mM bicarbonate pH 9.6. Clones positive in ELISA are further characterized by PCR fingerprinting see e.g. WO92 01047 and then by sequencing.

One method to identify and clone VH and VL domains from cell lines expressing a particular antibody is to perform PCR with VH and VL specific primers on cDNA made from the antibody expressing cell lines. Briefly RNA is isolated from the cell lines and used as a template for RT PCR designed to amplify the VH and VL domains of the antibodies expressed by the EBV cell lines. Cells may lysed in the TRIzol reagent Life Technologies Rockville. Md. and extracted with one fifth volume of chloroform. After addition of chloroform the solution is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes and the centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C. in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant is collected and RNA is precipitated using an equal volume of isopropanol. Precipitated RNA is pelleted by centrifuging at 14 000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C in a tabletop centrifuge. Following centrifugation the supernatant is and washed with 75 ethanol. Follwing washing the RNA is centrifuged again at 800 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet allowed to air dry. RNA is the dissolved in DEPC water and heated to 60 C. for 10 minutes. Quantities of RNA can determined using optical density measurements.

cDNA may be synthesized according to methods well known in the art from 1.5 2.5 micrograms of RNA using reverse transciptase and random hexamer primers. cDNA is then used as a template for PCR amplification of VH and VL domains. Primers used to amplify VH and VL genes are shown in Table 8. Typically a PCR reaction makes use of a single 5 primer and a single 3 primer Sometimes when the amount of available RNA template is limiting or for greater efficiency groups of 5 and or 3 primers may be used. For example sometimes all five VH 5 primers and all JH3 primers are used in a single PCR reaction. The PCR reaction is carried out in a 50 microliter volume containing 1 PCR buffer 2 mM of each dNTP 0.7 units of High Fidelity Taq polymerase 5 primer mix 3 primer mix and 7.5 microliters of cDNA. The 5 and 3 primer mix of both VH and VL can be made by pooling together 22 pmole and 28 pmole respectively of each of the individual primers. PCR conditions are 96 C. for 5 minutes followed by 25 cycles of 94 C. for 1 minute 50 C. for 1 minute and 72 C. for 1 minute followed by an extension cycle of 72 C. for 10 minutes. After the reaction is completed sample tubes were stored 4 C.

PCR samples are then electrophoresed on a 1.3 agarose gel. DNA bands of the expected sizes 506 base pairs for VH domains and 344 base pairs for VL domains can be cut out of the gel and purified using methods well known in the art. Purified PCR products can be ligated into a PCR cloning vector TA vector from Invitrogen Inc. Carlsbad Calif. . Individual cloned PCR products can be isolated after transfection of and blue white color selection. Cloned PCR products may then be sequenced using methods commonly known in the art.

One of skill in the art could routinely modify the above described PCR reaction in order to amplify VH and VL domains from other sources e.g. plasmids encoding an scFv of the invention. .

The DNA sequence encoding the full length C3a Receptor protein ATCC Deposit No. 75982 is amplified using PCR oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5 and 3 sequences of the gene 

The 5 primer has the sequence 5 CGGGATCCCTCCGTCTTTCTGCT 3 SEQ ID NO 41 and contains a BamHI restriction enzyme site followed by four nucleotides resembling an efficient signal for the initiation of translation in eukaryotic cells J. Mol. Biol. 1987 196 947 950 Kozak M. which is just behind the first 18 nucleotides of the gene the initiation codon for translation ATG is underlined .

The 3 primer has the sequence 5 CGGGATCCCGCTCACACAGGTACT 3 SEQ ID NO 42 and contains the cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease BamHI and the 3 primer has the sequence 5 18 nucleotides complementary to the 3 non translated sequence of the C3a Receptor gene. The amplified sequences are isolated from a 1 agarose gel using a commercially available kit Geneclean BIO 101 Inc. La Jolla Calif. . The fragment is then digested with the endonuclease Baal and then isolated again on a 1 agarose gel. This fragment is designated F2.

The vector pRG1 modification of pVL941 vector discussed below is used for the expression of the C3a Receptor protein using the baculovirus expression system for review see Summers M. D. and Smith G. E. 1987 A manual of methods for baculovirus vectors and insect cell culture procedures Texas Agricultural Experimental Station Bulletin No. 1555 . This expression vector contains the strong polyhedrin promoter of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcMNPV followed by the recognition sites for the restriction endonuclease BamHI. The polyadenylation site of the simian virus SV 40 is used for efficient polyadenylation. For an easy selection of recombinant viruses the beta galactosidase gene from is inserted in the same orientation as the polyhedrin promoter followed by the polyadenylation signal of the polyhedrin gene. The polyhedrin sequences are flanked at both sides by viral sequences for the cell mediated homologous recombination of co transfected wild type viral DNA. Many other baculovirus vectors could be used in place of pRG1 such as pAc373 pVL941 and pAcIM1 Luckow V. A. and Summers M. D. Virology 170 31 39 .

The plasmid is digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and then dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase by procedures known in the art. The DNA is then isolated from a 1 agarose gel as described above. This vector DNA is designated V2.

Fragment F2 and the dephosphorylated plasmid V2 are ligated with T4 DNA ligase. HB101 cells are then transformed and bacteria identified that contained the plasmid pBacC3a Receptor with the C3a Receptor gene using the enzyme BamHI The sequence of the cloned fragment is confirmed by DNA sequencing.

5 g of the plasmid pBacC3a Receptor is co transfected with 1.0 g of a commercially available linearized baculovirus BaculoGoldn baculovirus DNA Pharmingen San Diego Calif. using the lipofection method Felgner et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 7413 7417 1987 .

1 g of BaculoGoldn virus DNA and 5 g of the plasmid pBacC3a Receptor are mixed in a sterile well of a microtiter plate containing 50 l of serum free Grace s medium Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg Md. . Afterwards 10 l Lipofectin plus 90 pl Grace s medium are added mixed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then the transfection mixture is added dropwise to the Sf9 insect cells ATCC CRL 1711 seeded in a 35 mm tissue culture plate with 1 ml Grace s medium without serum. The plate is rocked back and forth to mix the newly added solution. The plate is then incubated for 5 hours at 27 . After 5 hours the transfection solution from the plate and 1 ml of Grace s insect medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum is added. The plate is put back into an incubator and cultivation continued at 27 C for four days.

After four days the supernatant is collected and a plaque assay performed similar as described by Summers and Smith supra . Antibodies or antibody compositions of the present invention may be used as a modification an agarose gel with Blue Gal Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg is used which detailed description of a plaque assay can also be found in the user s guide for insect cell culture and baculovirology distributed by Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg page 9 10 .

Four days after the serial dilution the viruses are added to the cells and blue stained plaques are picked with the tip of an Eppendorf pipette. The agar containing the recombinant viruses is then resuspended in an Eppendorf tube containing 200 pl of Grace s medium. The agar is removed by a brief centrifugation and the supernatant containing the recombinant baculoviruses is used to infect Sf9 cells seeded in 35 mm dishes. Four days later the supernatants of these culture dishes are harvested and then stored at 4 C.

Sf9 cells are grown in Grace s medium supplemented with 10 heat inactivated FBS. The cells are infected with the recombinant baculovirus V C3a Receptor at a multiplicity of infection MOI of 2. Six hours later the medium is removed and replaced with SF900 II medium minus methionine and cysteine Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg . 42 hours later 5 Ci of 35S methionine and 5 pCi 35S cysteine Amersham are added. The cells are further incubated for 16 hours before they are harvested by centrifugation and the labeled proteins visualized by SDS PAGE and autoradiography.

Northern blot analysis is carried out to examine the levels of expression of C3a Receptor in human tissues. Total cellular RNA samples are isolated with FIAzol B system Bioteck Laboratories Inc. Houston Tex. . About 10 g of total RNA isolated from each human tissue specified is separated on 1 agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon filter Sambrook Fritsch and Maniatis Molecular Cloning Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989 . The labeling reaction is done according to the Stratagene Prime It kit with 50 ng DNA fragment. The labeled DNA is purified with a Select G 50 column. 5 Prime 3 Prime Inc. Boulder Colo. . The filter is then hybridized with radioactive labeled full length C3a Receptor gene at 1 000 000 cpm ml in 0.5 M NaPO pH 7.4 and 7 SDS overnight at 65 C. After being washed twice at room temperature and twice at 60 C. with 0.5 SSC 0.1 SDS the filter is then exposed at 70 C. overnight with an intensifying screen. The message RNA for C3a Receptor is abundant in peripheral lymphocytes.
