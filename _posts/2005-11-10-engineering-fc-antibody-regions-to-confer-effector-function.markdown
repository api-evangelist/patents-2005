title: Engineering Fc Antibody regions to confer effector function
abstract: The present invention relates to molecules having a variant Fc region, wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild-type Fc region. These modified molecules confer an effector function to a molecule, where the parent molecule does not detectably exhibit this effector function. In particular, the molecules of the invention have an increased effector cell function mediated by a FcγR, such as, but not limited to, ADCC. In one embodiment, the variant Fc region binds FcγRIIIA and/or FcγRIIA with a greater affinity, relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild-type Fc region. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment, prevention or management of a disease or disorder, such as cancer, in a sub-population of patients, wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population, in particular, in patients refractory to treatment with an existing therapeutic antibody due to the low level of target antigen expression on the cancer or associated cells.

This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60 626 510 and 60 636 056 filed on Nov. 10 2004 and Dec. 13 2004 respectively both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The present invention relates to molecules having a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to a wild type Fc region. These modified molecules confer an effector function to a molecule where the parent molecule does not detectably exhibit this effector function. In particular the molecules of the invention have an increased effector cell function mediated by a Fc R such as but not limited to ADCC. In one embodiment the variant Fc region binds Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA with a greater affinity relative to a comparable molecule comprising the wild type Fc region. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment prevention or management of a disease or disorder such as cancer in a sub population of patients wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population in particular in patients refractory to treatment with an existing therapeutic antibody due to the low level of target antigen expression on the cancer or associated cells.

The interaction of antibody antigen complexes with cells of the immune system results in a wide array of responses ranging from effector functions such as antibody dependent cytotoxicity mast cell degranulation and phagocytosis to immunomodulatory signals such as regulating lymphocyte proliferation and antibody secretion. All these interactions are initiated through the binding of the Fc domain of antibodies or immune complexes to specialized cell surface receptors on hematopoietic cells. The diversity of cellular responses triggered by antibodies and immune complexes results from the structural heterogeneity of Fc receptors. Fc receptors share structurally related ligand binding domains which presumably mediate intracellular signaling.

The Fc receptors members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily of proteins are surface glycoproteins that can bind the Fc portion of immunoglobulin molecules. Each member of the family recognizes immunoglobulins of one or more isotypes through a recognition domain on the a chain of the Fc receptor. Fc receptors are defined by their specificity for immunoglobulin subtypes. Fc receptors for IgG are referred to as Fc R for IgE as FFR and for IgA as Fc R. Different accessory cells bear Fc receptors for antibodies of different isotype and the isotype of the antibody determines which accessory cells will be engaged in a given response reviewed by Ravetch J. V. et al. 1991 9 457 92 Gerber J. S. et al. 2001 3 131 139 Billadeau D. D. et al. 2002 2 109 161 1681 Ravetch J. V. et al. 2000 290 84 89 Ravetch J. V. et al. 2001 19 275 90 Ravetch J. V. 1994 78 4 553 60 . The different Fc receptors the cells that express them and their isotype specificity is summarized in Table 1 adapted from 4ed. 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd Garland Publishing New York .

Each member of this family is an integral membrane glycoprotein possessing extracellular domains related to a C2 set of immunoglobulin related domains a single membrane spanning domain and an intracytoplasmic domain of variable length. There are three known Fc Rs designated Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 . The three receptors are encoded by distinct genes however the extensive homology between the three family members suggest they arose from a common progenitor perhaps by gene duplication.

Fc RII proteins are 40 KDa integral membrane glycoproteins which bind only the complexed IgG due to a low affinity for monomeric Ig 10M . This receptor is the most widely expressed Fc R present on all hematopoietic cells including monocytes macrophages B cells NK cells neutrophils mast cells and platelets. Fc RII has only two immunoglobulin like regions in its immunoglobulin binding chain and hence a much lower affinity for IgG than Fc RI. There are three human Fc RII genes Fc RII A Fc RII B Fc RII C all of which bind IgG in aggregates or immune complexes.

Distinct differences within the cytoplasmic domains of Fc RII A and Fc RII B create two functionally heterogenous responses to receptor ligation. The fundamental difference is that the A isoform initiates intracellular signaling leading to cell activation such as phagocytosis and respiratory burst whereas the B isoform initiates inhibitory signals e.g. inhibiting B cell activation.

Both activating and inhibitory signals are transduced through the Fc Rs following ligation. These diametrically opposing functions result from structural differences among the different receptor isoforms. Two distinct domains within the cytoplasmic signaling domains of the receptor called immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs ITAMs or immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motifs IFIMS account for the different responses. The recruitment of different cytoplasmic enzymes to these structures dictates the outcome of the Fc R mediated cellular responses. ITAM containing Fc R complexes include Fc RI Fc RIIA Fc RIIIA whereas ITIM containing complexes only include Fc RIIB.

Human neutrophils express the Fc RIIA gene. Fc RIIA clustering via immune complexes or specific antibody cross linking serves to aggregate ITAMs along with receptor associated kinases which facilitate ITAM phosphorylation. ITAM phosphorylation serves as a docking site for Syk kinase activation of which results in activation of downstream substrates e.g. PIK . Cellular activation leads to release of proinflammatory mediators.

The Fc RIIB gene is expressed on B lymphocytes its extracellular domain is 96 identical to Fc RIIA and binds IgG complexes in an indistinguishable manner. The presence of an ITIM in the cytoplasmic domain of Fc RIIB defines this inhibitory subclass of Fc R. Recently the molecular basis of this inhibition was established. When coligated along with an activating Fc R the ITIM in Fc RIIB becomes phosphorylated and attracts the SH2 domain of the inosital polyphosphate 5 phosphatase SHIP which hydrolyzes phosphoinositol messengers released as a consequence of ITAM containing Fc R mediated tyrosine kinase activation consequently preventing the influx of intracellular Ca. Thus crosslinking of Fc RIIB dampens the activating response to Fc R ligation and inhibits cellular responsiveness. B cell activation B cell proliferation and antibody secretion is thus aborted.

Current approaches to optimize the Fc region function e.g. antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC activity in therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and soluble polypeptides fused to Fc regions have focused on a limited number of single amino acid changes based on structural analysis and or computer aided designs. Alternative approaches in engineering Fc regions have focused on the glycosylation of the Fc region to optimize Fc region function.

The present invention is based in part on the inventors discovery of methods for engineering the Fc region of an antibody to confer one or more effector function activities to a parent antibody which parent antibody does not exhibit the particular effector function activity at a detectable level when tested against a target cell. Such methods of engineering include introducing one or more amino acid modifications substitutions deletions or insertions in one or more portions of the Fc region which modifications introduce a detectable level of the effector function activity in the modified antibody. In certain embodiments the modifications alter the parent antibody s affinity for certain Fc R receptors e.g. activating Fc Rs inhibitory Fc Rs and one or more effector functions such as antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC . In other embodiments the modifications confer homo oligomerization activity to the parent Fc region such that oligomerization of the modified antibody cross links cell surface antigens resulting in apoptosis negative growth regulation or cell killing.

The inventors have found that modification of an Fc region of a chimeric 2B6 antibody anti Fc RIIB antibody surprisingly conferred an effector function activity particularly ADCC on chimeric 2B6 antibodies which normally exhibit no detectable ADCC in routine in vitro ADCC assays. The inventors have found that modification of an Fc region of a chimeric 4D5 antibody anti Fc RIIB antibody surprisingly improved the effector function activity particularly ADCC of chimeric 4D5 antibodies in cells with low levels of antigen expression. The inventors have further found that modification of an Fc region of rituximab anti CD20 monoclonal antibody conferred effector function activity on the rituximab antibody in cells from a patient population whose cells were otherwise refractory to rituximab induced effector function activity.

In one aspect the invention encompasses molecules preferably polypeptides and more preferably immunoglobulins e.g. antibodies comprising a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications e.g. substitutions but also including deletions or insertions in one or more Fc regions relative to a parent molecule which modifications confer a particular effector function activity on the modified molecule as compared to the parent molecule which has little or no detectable activity of that effector function as measured using standard in vitro methods known in the art and exemplified herein . The effector function activities that may be conferred using the methods of the invention include but are not limited to ADCC antibody dependent phagocytosis phagocytosis opsonization opsonophagocytosis cell binding rosetting complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity CDC .

Another aspect of the invention relates to molecules preferably polypeptides and more preferably immunoglobulins e.g. antibodies comprising a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications e.g. substitutions deletions insertions in one or more portions which modifications increase the affinity and avidity of the variant Fc region for an Fc R including activating and inhibitory Fc Rs . In some embodiments said one or more amino acid modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA. In another embodiment the variant Fc region further specifically binds Fc RIIB with a lower affinity than does the Fc region of the comparable parent antibody i.e. an antibody having the same amino acid sequence as the antibody of the invention except for the one or more amino acid modifications in the Fc region . In some embodiments such modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA and also enhance the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIB relative to the parent antibody. In other embodiments said one or more amino acid modifications increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA but do not alter the affinity of the variant Fc regions for Fc RIIB relative to the Fc region of the parent antibody. In another embodiment said one or more amino acid modifications enhance the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIA but reduce the affinity for Fc RIIB relative to the parent antibody.

Increased affinity and or avidity results in detectable binding to the Fc R or detectable Fc R related activity in cells that express low levels of the Fc R when binding activity of the parent molecule without the modified Fc region cannot be detected on the cells. In certain embodiments the target antigen of the modified antibody is an Fc R and the modified antibody exhibits Fc R binding or related activity in cells which express the target Fc R at a density of 10 000 molecules cell or less at a density of 5000 molecules cell or less at a density of 1000 molecules cell or less at a density of 500 molecules or less or at a density of 200 molecules or less but at least 10 at least 50 at least 100 or at least 150 molecules cell . In embodiments wherein the target antigen is an Fc R the increased binding to the on the cell surface may be mediated by the CDR region of the antibody to an epitope on the target Fc R. Furthermore this mechanism of increased antigen binding may occur with antibodies against non Fc receptors or surface proteins.

The invention encompasses molecules e.g. antibodies with altered affinities and avidities for one or more target Fc Rs. The antibodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for one or more target Fc Rs are particularly useful in cellular systems for example for research or diagnostic purposes where the Fc Rs are expressed at low levels for example tumor specific B cells with low levels of Fc RIIB e.g. non Hodgkins lymphoma CLL and Burkitt s lymphoma . Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action the molecules of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for a particular target Fc R are valuable as research and diagnostic tools by enhancing the sensitivity of detection of Fc Rs which are normally undetectable due to a low level of expression. The antibodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for Fc Rs are particularly useful for the treatment prevention or management of a cancer or another disease or disorder in a subject wherein the Fc Rs are expressed at low levels in the target cell populations. As used herein Fc R expression in cells is defined in terms of the density of such molecules per cell as measured using common methods known to those skilled in the art. The molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions preferably also have an enhanced avidity and affinity and or effector function in cells which express a target antigen to which the modified antibody immunospecifically binds e.g. a cancer antigen at low density for example at a density of 30 000 to 20 000 molecules cell at a density of 20 000 to 10 000 molecules cell at a density of 10 000 to 5 000 molecules cell at a density of 5 000 to 1 000 molecules cell at a density of 1 000 to 200 molecules cell or at a density of 200 molecules cell or less. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment prevention or management of a disease or disorder such as cancer in a sub population of patients wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population in particular in patients refractory to treatment with an existing therapeutic antibody due to the low level of target antigen expression on the cancer or other cells associated with the disease or disorder to be treated prevented or managed.

The invention encompasses engineering human chimeric or humanized therapeutic antibodies in the Fc region by modifying one or more Fc region amino acids which modifications alter the detectable affinity and avidity of the antibodies for one or more target antigens e.g. Fc R receptors or cancer antigens and or the detectable effector function activity or cell killing activity of the modified antibody. In one embodiment said one or more modifications to the amino acids of the Fc region enhance the affinity and avidity of the antibody for one or more target antigens e.g. Fc R receptors or cancer antigens. These therapeutic antibodies by virtue of the modifications of the invention have increased efficacy in patients refractory to treatment with the parent antibody due in certain instances to reduced levels of the expression of the target antigen as well as in patients who respond to the parent antibody.

Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action therapeutic antibodies engineered in accordance with the invention have enhanced therapeutic efficacy in part due to the ability of the Fc portion of the antibody to bind a target cell which expresses the particular Fc Rs at reduced levels for example by virtue of the ability of the antibody to remain on the target cell longer due to an improved off rate for Fc Fc R interaction. In another embodiment said one or more modifications to the amino acids of the Fc region modifies the affinity and avidity of the antibody for one or more Fc R receptors. In a specific embodiment the invention encompasses antibodies comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to the parent Fc region which variant Fc region only binds one Fc R wherein said Fc R is Fc RIIIA. In another specific embodiment the invention encompasses antibodies comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to the parent Fc region which variant Fc region only binds one Fc R wherein said Fc R is Fc RIIA. In yet another embodiment the invention encompasses antibodies comprising a variant Fc region wherein said variant Fc region comprises at least one amino acid modification relative to the parent Fc region which variant Fc region only binds one Fc R wherein said Fc R is Fc RIIB.

The affinities and binding properties of the antibodies of the invention for the target antigen or an Fc R are initially determined using in vitro assays biochemical or immunological based assays known in the art for determining antigen antibody or Fc Fc R interactions i.e. specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R respectively including but not limited to ELISA assay surface plasmon resonance assay or immunoprecipitation assay. Preferably the binding properties of the molecules of the invention are also characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more Fc R mediated effector cell functions. In most preferred embodiments the antibodies of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models such as those described and disclosed herein as those in in vitro based assays. However the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo.

The invention also encompasses molecules preferably polypeptides and more preferably immunoglobulins e.g. antibodies comprising a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications e.g. substitutions deletions insertions in one or more portions which modifications confer detectable effector function activity to the molecule not detectable in the parent molecule.

In yet other embodiments the parent antibody is rituximab or humanized 2B6 see U.S. Patent Application Publication 2004 0185045 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 126 978 filed May 10 2005 by Johnson et al. which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties and the modified antibodies are used to treat the indications associated with the parent antibodies. Although not intending to be bound to a particular mechanism of action the molecules of the invention with conferred effector function activity are particularly useful for the treatment and or prevention of a disease or disorder where an effector cell function e.g. ADCC mediated by an Fc R is desired e.g. cancer infectious disease . Alternately the molecules of the invention with Fc modifications may exhibit enhanced therapeutic efficacy due to the introduction of homo oligomerization activity in the Fc region resulting in apoptosis negative growth regulation or cell killing associated with surface antigen cross linking.

The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment prevention or management of a cancer in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising a variant Fc region engineered in accordance with the invention which molecule further binds a cancer antigen.

Molecules of the invention comprising the variant Fc regions are particularly useful for the prevention inhibition reduction of growth or regression of primary tumors or metastasis of cancer cells. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action molecules of the invention enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics by i enhancing antibody mediated effector function or ii enhancing the apoptosis signaling negative growth regulation or cell killing associated with surface antigen cross linking by introducing homo oligornerization activity in the modified molecules resulting in an enhanced rate of tumor clearance or an enhanced rated of tumor reduction or a combination thereof.

According to an aspect of the invention immunotherapeutics may be modifying in accordance with the invention to increase the potency of an antibody effector function activity e.g. ADCC CDC phagocytosis opsonization etc. In a specific embodiment antibody dependent cellular toxicity and or phagocytosis e.g. of tumor cells is enhanced by modifying immunotherapeutics with variant Fc regions of the invention.

As used herein the term Fc region is used to define a C terminal region of an IgG heavy chain. Throughout the present specification the numbering of the residues in an IgG heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al. 5Ed. Public Health Service NH1 MD 1991 expressly incorporated herein by references. The EU index as in Kabat refers to the numbering of the human IgG1 EU antibody. An example of the amino acid sequence containing the human IgG1 Fc region is SEQ ID NO 11 and is shown in . SEQ ID NO 11 and set forth the amino acid sequence of the IgG1 hinge Fc region. Although boundaries may vary slightly as numbered according to the Kabat system the Fc domain extends from amino acid 231 to amino acid 447 which corresponds to amino acid 16 to amino acid 232 as numbered in SEQ ID NO 11 and .

The Fc region of an IgG comprises two constant domains CH2 and CH3. The CH2 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 231 to amino acid 341 according to the numbering system of Kabat corresponding to amino acids 16 to 126 as numbered in SEQ ID NO 11 and . The CH3 domain of a human IgG Fc region usually extends from amino acids 342 to 447 according to the numbering system of Kabat corresponding to amino acids 127 to 232 as numbered in SEQ ID NO 11 and .

In some embodiments the molecules of the invention further comprise one or more glycosylation sites so that one or more carbohydrate moieties are covalently attached to the molecule. Preferably the molecules of the invention with one or more glycosylation sites and or one or more modifications in the Fc region confer or have an enhanced antibody mediated effector function e.g. enhanced ADCC activity compared to a parent antibody. In some embodiments the invention further comprises molecules comprising one or more modifications of amino acids that are directly or indirectly known to interact with a carbohydrate moiety of the antibody including but not limited to amino acids at positions 241 243 244 245 245 249 256 258 260 262 264 265 296 299 and 301. Amino acids that directly or indirectly interact with a carbohydrate moiety of an antibody are known in the art see e.g. Jefferis et al. 1995 44 111 7 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In another embodiment the invention encompasses molecules that have been modified by introducing one or more glycosylation sites into one or more sites of the molecules preferably without altering the functionality of the molecules e.g. binding activity to target antigen or Fc R. Glycosylation sites may be introduced into the variable and or constant region of the molecules of the invention. As used herein glycosylation sites include any specific amino acid sequence in an antibody to which an oligosaccharide ie. carbohydrates containing two or more simple sugars linked together will specifically and covalently attach. Oligosaccharide side chains are typically linked to the backbone of an antibody via either N or O linkages. N linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of an oligosaccharide moiety to a hydroxyamino acid e.g. serine threonine. The molecules of the invention may comprise one or more glycosylation sites including N linked and O linked glycosylation sites. Any glycosylation site for N linked or O linked glycosylation known in the art may be used in accordance with the instant invention. An exemplary N linked glycosylation site that is useful in accordance with the methods of the present invention is the amino acid sequence Asn X Thr Ser wherein X may be any amino acid and Thr Ser indicates a threonine or a serine. Such a site or sites may be introduced into a molecule of the invention using methods well known in the art to which this invention pertains. See for example J. D. Watson et al. W.H. Freeman and Company New York 1983 chapter 8 pp. 106 116 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. An exemplary method for introducing a glycosylation site into a molecule of the invention may comprise modifying or mutating an amino acid sequence of the molecule so that the desired Asn X Thr Ser sequence is obtained.

In some embodiments the invention encompasses methods of modifying the carbohydrate content of a molecule of the invention by adding or deleting a glycosylation site. Methods for modifying the carbohydrate content of antibodies are well known in the art and encompassed within the invention see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 218 149 EP 0 359 096 B1 U.S. Publication No. US 2002 0028486 WO 03 035835 U.S. Publication No. 2003 0115614 U.S. Pat. No. 6 218 149 U.S. Pat. No. 6 472 511 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In other embodiments the invention encompasses methods of modifying the carbohydrate content of a molecule of the invention by deleting one or more endogenous carbohydrate moieties of the molecule. In a specific embodiment the invention encompasses shifting the glycosylation site of the Fc region of an antibody by modifying positions adjacent to 297. In a specific embodiment the invention encompasses modifying position 296 so that position 296 and not position 297 is glycosylated.

The present invention is based in part on the inventors discovery of methods for engineering the Fc region of an antibody to confer an effector function activity to the antibody which the parent antibody did not exhibit when tested against a target cell. Such methods of engineering include introducing one or more amino acid modifications substitutions deletions or insertions in one or more portions of the Fc region which modifications introduce a detectable effector function activity on the parent antibody. In particular the modifications alter the parent antibody s affinity for certain Fc R receptors e.g. activating Fc Rs inhibitory Fc Rs and one or more effector functions such as ADCC. Alternately the modifications alter the affinity of the variant Fc region such that the variant Fc regions oligomerize and homo oligomers of the modified antibody are formed. The inventors have found that modification of an Fc region of a chimeric 2B6 or 4D5 antibody anti Fc RIIB antibody surprisingly conferred a particular effector function activity ADCC on chimeric 2B6 antibodies which normally exhibit no detectable ADCC activity and improved effector function activity particularly ADCC of chimeric 4D5 antibodies in cells with low levels of antigen expression. The inventors have further found that modification of an Fc region of rituximab anti CD20 monoclonal antibody conferred effector function activity on the rituximab antibody in a patient population whose cells were otherwise refractory to rituximab induced effector function activity.

It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that aside from amino acid substitutions the present invention contemplates other modifications of the Fc region amino acid sequence in order to generate an Fc region variant with one or more altered properties e.g. enhanced effector function. The invention contemplates deletion of one or more amino acid residues of the Fc region in order to e.g. reduce binding to an Fc R. Preferably no more than 5 no more than 10 no more than 20 no more than 30 no more than 50 Fc region residues will be deleted according to this embodiment of the invention. The Fc region herein comprising one or more amino acid deletions will preferably retain at least about 80 and preferably at least about 90 and most preferably at least about 95 of the wild type Fc region. In some embodiments one or more properties of the molecules are maintained such as for example non immunogenicity Fc RIIIA binding Fc RIIA binding or a combination of these properties.

In alternate embodiments the invention encompasses amino acid insertion to generate the Fc region variants which variants have altered properties including enhanced effector function. In one specific embodiment the invention encompasses introducing at least one amino acid residue for example one to two amino acid residues and preferably no more than 10 amino acid residues adjacent to one or more of the Fc region positions identified herein. In alternate embodiments the invention further encompasses introducing at least one amino acid residue for example one to two amino acid residues and preferably no more than 10 amino acid residues adjacent to one or more of the Fc region positions known in the art as impacting Fc R interaction and or binding.

The invention further encompasses incorporation of unnatural amino acids to generate the Fc variants of the invention. Such methods are known to those skilled in the art such as those using the natural biosynthetic machinery to allow incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins see e.g. Wang et al. 2002 Chem. Comm. 1 1 11 Wang et al. 2001 Science 292 498 500 van Hest et al. 2001. Chem. Comm. 19 1897 1904 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternative strategies focus on the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of amino acyl tRNA see e.g. Tang et al. 2001 J. Am. Chem. 123 44 11089 11090 Kiick et al. 2001 FEBS Lett. 505 3 465 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The effector function properties of the molecules of the invention are determined for one or more Fc R mediator effector cell functions as described in Section 5.2.7. The affinities and binding properties of the molecules of the invention for a target antigen or an Fc R are initially determined using in vitro assays biochemical or immunological based assays known in the art for determining antibody antigen or Fc Fc R interactions i.e. specific binding of an antibody to an antigen or an Fc region to an Fc R respectively including but not limited to ELISA assay surface plasmon resonance assay immunoprecipitation assays See Section 5.2.1 . In most preferred embodiments the molecules of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models such as those described and disclosed herein as those in in vitro based assays. However the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo. A representative flow chart of the screening and characterization of molecules of the invention is described in .

The invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region that binds with a greater affinity to one or more Fc Rs. Such molecules preferably mediate effector function more effectively as discussed infra. In other embodiments the invention encompasses molecules comprising a variant Fc region that bind with a weaker affinity to one or more Fc Rs. In general increased or added effector function would be directed to tumor and foreign cells.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fc modifications including but not limited to other modifications that enhance effector function. The invention encompasses combining an Fc variant of the invention with other Fc modifications to provide additive synergistic or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. Preferably the Fc variants of the invention enhance the phenotype of the modification with which they are combined. For example if an Fc variant of the invention is combined with a mutant known to bind Fc RIIIA with a higher affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region the combination with a mutant of the invention results in a greater fold enhancement in Fc RIIIA affinity.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Duncan et al 1988 Nature 332 563 564 Lund et al. 1991 J.

In some embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention are incorporated into an antibody or Fc fusion that comprises one or more engineered glycoforms i.e. a carbohydrate composition that is covalently attached to an antibody comprising an Fc region wherein said carbohydrate composition differs chemically from that of a parent antibody comprising an Fc region. Engineered glycoforms may be useful for a variety of purposes including but not limited to enhancing effector function. Engineered glycoforms may be generated by any method known to one skilled in the art for example by using engineered or variant expression strains by co expression with one or more enzymes for example DI N acetylglucosaminyltransferase III GnT111 by expressing an antibody comprising an Fc region in various organisms or cell lines from various organisms or by modifying carbohydrate s after the antibody comprising Fc region has been expressed. Methods for generating engineered glycoforms are known in the art and include but are not limited to those described in Umana et al 1999 Nat. Biotechnol 17 176 180 Davies et al. 2001 Biotechnol Bioeng 74 288 294 Shields et al 2002 J Biol Chem 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et al. 2003 J Biol Chem 278 3466 3473 U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 U.S. Ser.

See e.g. WO 00061739 EA01229125 US 20030115614 Okazaki et al. 2004 JMB 336 1239 49 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be optimized for a variety of properties. Properties that may be optimized include but are not limited to conferred or enhanced effector function enhanced or reduced affinity for an Fc R or conferred oligomerization activity. In a preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to possess enhanced affinity for a human activating Fc R preferably Fc R Fc RIIA Fc RIIc Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIIB most preferably Fc RIIIA. In an alternate preferred embodiment the Fc variants are optimized to possess reduced affinity for the human inhibitory receptor Fc RIIB. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with new or enhanced therapeutic properties in humans for example enhanced effector function and greater anti cancer potency as described and exemplified herein. These preferred embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced tumor elimination in mouse xenograft tumor models.

In an alternate embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention are optimized to have reduced affinity for a human Fc R including but not limited to Fc RI Fc RIIA Fc RIIB Fc RIIc Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIIB. These embodiments are anticipated to provide antibodies and Fc fusions with enhanced therapeutic properties in humans for example reduced toxicity.

In alternate embodiments the Fc variants of the present invention possess a conferred effector function and or enhanced or reduced affinity for Fc Rs from non human organisms including but not limited to mice rats rabbits and monkeys. Fc variants that are optimized for effector function in a non human or binding to a non human Fc R may find use in experimentation. For example mouse models are available for a variety of diseases that enable testing of properties such as efficacy toxicity and pharmacokinetics for a given drug candidate. As is known in the art cancer cells can be grafted or injected into mice to mimic a human cancer a process referred to as xenografting. Testing of antibodies or Fc fusions that comprise Fc variants that confer an effector function and or are optimized for one or more mouse Fc Rs may provide valuable information with regard to the efficacy of the antibody or Fc fusion its mechanism of action and the like.

In certain embodiments while it is preferred to alter binding to an Fc R the instant invention further contemplates Fc variants with altered binding affinity to the neonatal receptor FcRn . Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action Fc region variants with improved affinity for FcRn are anticipated to have longer serum half lives and such antibodies will have useful applications in methods of treating mammals where long half life of the administered polypeptide is desired e.g. to treat a chronic disease or disorder. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action Fc region variants with decreased FcRn binding affinity on the contrary are expected to have shorter half lives and such antibodies may for example be administered to a mammal where a shortened circulation time may be advantageous e.g. for in vivo diagnostic imaging or for polypeptides which have toxic side effects when left circulating in the blood stream for extended periods. Fc region variants with decreased FcRn binding affinity are anticipated to be less likely to cross the placenta and thus may be utilized in the treatment of diseases or disorders in pregnant women.

In other embodiments these variants may be combined with other known Fc modifications with altered FcRn affinity such as those disclosed in International Publication Nos. WO 98 23289 and WO 97 34631 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 277 375 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention encompasses any other method known in the art for generating molecules e.g. antibodies having an increased half life in vivo for example by introducing one or more amino acid modifications i.e. substitutions insertions or deletions into an IgG constant domain or FcRn binding fragment thereof preferably a Fc or hinge Fc domain fragment . See e.g. International Publication Nos. WO 98 23289 and WO 97 34631 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 277 375 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety to be used in combination with the Fc variants of the invention. Further molecules e.g. antibodies of the invention can be conjugated to albumin in order to make the antibody or antibody fragment more stable in vivo or have a longer half life in vivo. The techniques well known in the art see e.g. International Publication Nos. WO 93 15199 WO 93 15200 and WO 01 77137 and European Patent No. EP 413 622 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The variant s described herein may be subjected to further modifications often times depending on the intended use of the variant. Such modifications may involve further alteration of the amino acid sequence substitution insertion and or deletion of amino acid residues fusion to heterologous polypeptide s and or covalent modifications. Such further modifications may be made prior to simultaneously with or following the amino acid modification s disclosed herein which results in altered properties such as an enhanced binding to target antigen conferred oligomerization activity or enhanced effector function and or alteration of Fc receptor binding.

Alternatively or additionally the invention encompasses combining the amino acid modifications disclosed herein with one or more further amino acid modifications that confer or enhance additional effector functions e.g. C1q binding and or complement dependent cytoxicity function of the Fc region as determined in vitro and or in vivo. The further amino acid substitutions described herein will generally serve to confer the activity on a parent antibody that does not exhibit detectable levels of the activity or enhance the ability of the starting antibody to bind to C1q and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function. For example the starting antibody may be unable to bind C1q and or mediate CDC and may be modified according to the teachings herein such that it acquires these further effector functions. Moreover antibodies with preexisting C1q binding activity optionally further having the ability to mediate CDC may be modified such that one or both of these activities are enhanced. In some embodiments the invention encompasses variant Fc regions with altered CDC activity without any alteration in C1q binding. In yet other embodiments the invention encompasses variant Fc regions with altered CDC activity and altered C1q binding.

To generate an Fc region with altered C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function the amino acid positions to be modified are generally selected from positions 270 322 326 327 329 331 333 and 334 where the numbering of the residues in an IgG heavy chain is that of the EU index as in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 199 . These amino acid modifications may be combined with one or more Fc modifications disclosed herein to provide a synergistic or additive effect on C1q binding and or CDC activity. In other embodiments the invention encompasses Fc variants with altered C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function comprising an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 255 with leucine or an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 419 with histidine an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 370 with glutamic acid an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 240 with alanine an amino acid substitution at position 396 with leucine and at position 392 with threonine an amino acid substitution at position 247 with leucine and at position 421 with lysine. The invention encompasses any known modification of the Fc region which alters C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function such as those disclosed in Idusogie et al. 2001 166 4 2571 5 Idusogie et al. 2000 164 8 4178 4184 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In specific embodiments the invention encompasses variant Fc regions with improved C1q binding and improved Fc RIII binding e.g. having both improved ADCC activity and improved CDC activity. In alternative embodiments the invention encompasses a variant Fc region with reduced CDC activity and or reduced ADCC activity. In other embodiments one may increase only one of these activities and optionally also reduce the other activity e.g. to generate an Fc region variant with improved ADCC activity but reduced CDC activity and vice versa.

In other specific embodiments the variant Fc region has a leucine at position 247 a lysine at position 421 and a glutamic acid at position 270 MgFc31 60 a threonine at position 392 a leucine at position 396 a glutamic acid at position 270 and a leucine at position 243 MgFc38 60 F243L a histidine at position 419 a leucine at position 396 and a glutamic acid at position 270 MGFc51 60 a histidine at position 419 a leucine at position 396 a glutamic acid at position 270 and a leucine at position 243 MGFc51 60 F243L an alanine at position 240 a leucine at position 396 and a glutamic acid at position 270 MGFc52 60 a lysine at position 255 and a leucine at position 396 MgFc55 a lysine at position 255 a leucine at position 396 and a glutamic acid at position 270 MGFc55 60 a lysine at position 255 a leucine at position 396 a glutamic acid at position 270 and a lysine at position 300 MGFc55 60 Y300L a lysine at position 255 a leucine at position 396 a glutamic acid at position 270 and a glycine at position 292 MGFc55 60 R292G a lysine at position 255 a leucine at position 396 a glutamic acid at position 270 and a leucine at position 243 MgFc55 60 F243L a glutamic acid at position 370 a leucine at position 396 and a glutamic acid at position 270 MGFc59 60 a glutamic acid at position 270 an aspartic acid at position 316 and a glycine at position 416 MgFc71 a leucine at position 243 a proline at position 292 an isoleucine at position 305 and a leucine at position 396 MGFc74 P396L or a leucine at position 243 a glutamic acid at position 270 an asparagine at position 392 and a leucine at position 396 or a leucine at position 243 a leucine at position 255 a glutamic acid at position 270 and a leucine at position 396 or a glutamine at position 297.

In another specific embodiment the one or more amino acid modifications which confers or increases the ADCC activity of the immunoglobulin is any of the mutations listed below in table 7.

Alternatively or additionally it may be useful to combine the above amino acid modifications or any other amino acid modifications disclosed herein with one or more further amino acid modifications that confer and or alter C1q binding and or complement dependent cytoxicity function of the Fc region. The further amino acid substitutions described herein will generally serve to alter the ability of the starting molecule to bind to C1q and or modify its complement dependent cytotoxicity function e.g. to reduce and preferably abolish these effector functions. Molecules comprising substitutions at one or more of the described positions with conferred or improved C1q binding and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC function are contemplated herein. For example the starting molecule may be unable to bind C1q and or mediate CDC and may be modified according to the teachings herein such that it acquires these further effector functions. Moreover molecules with preexisting C1q binding activity optionally further having the ability to mediate CDC may be modified such that one or both of these activities are enhanced.

As disclosed above one can design an Fc region with altered effector function e.g. by modifying or conferring C1q binding and or FcR binding and thereby changing CDC activity and or ADCC activity. For example one can generate a variant Fc region with improved or conferred C1q binding and improved or conferred Fc RIII binding e.g. having both conferred or improved ADCC activity and conferred or improved CDC activity. Alternatively where one desires that effector function be reduced or ablated one may engineer a variant Fc region with reduced CDC activity and or reduced ADCC activity. In other embodiments one may increase only one of these activities and optionally also reduce the other activity e.g. to generate an Fc region variant with improved ADCC activity but reduced CDC activity and vice versa.

The invention encompasses molecules with specific variants of the Fc region that have been identified using the methods of the invention from a yeast library of mutants after 2nd 4th round of sorting are listed in Table 8. Table 8 summarizes the various mutants that were identified using the methods of the invention. The mutants were assayed using an ELISA assay for determining binding to Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB. The mutants were also tested in an ADCC assay by cloning the Fc variants into a ch 4 4 20 antibody using methods disclosed and exemplified herein. Bolded items refer to experiments in which the ch4 4 20 were purified prior the ADCC assay. The antibody concentration used was standard for ADCC assays in the range 0.5 g mL 1.0 g mL.

In certain embodiments the invention provides modified molecules with variant Fc regions having one or more amino acid modifications which one or more amino acid modifications confer an effector function and or increase the affinity of the molecule for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA. Such molecules include IgG molecules that naturally contain Fc R binding regions e.g. Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIB binding region or immunoglobulin derivatives that have been engineered to contain an Fc R binding region e.g. Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIB binding region . The modified molecules of the invention include any immunoglobulin molecule that binds preferably immunospecifically i.e. competes off non specific binding as determined by immunoassays well known in the art for assaying specific antigen antibody binding an antigen and contains an Fc R binding region e.g. a Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIB binding region . Such antibodies include but are not limited to polyclonal monoclonal bi specific multi specific human humanized chimeric antibodies single chain antibodies Fab fragments F ab fragments disulfide linked Fvs Fc fusions and fragments containing either a VL or VH domain or even a complementary determining region CDR that specifically binds an antigen in certain cases engineered to contain or fused to an Fc R binding region.

In some embodiments the molecules of the invention comprise portions of an Fc region. As used herein the term portion of an Fc region refers to fragments of the Fc region preferably a portion with effector activity and or Fc R binding activity or a comparable region of a mutant lacking such activity . The fragment of an Fc region may range in size from 5 amino acids to the entire Fc region minus one amino acids. The portion of an Fc region may be missing up to 10 up to 20 up to 30 amino acids from the N terminus or C terminus.

The IgG molecules of the invention are preferably IgG1 subclass of IgGs but may also be any other IgG subclasses of given animals. For example in humans the IgG class includes IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4 and mouse IgG includes IgG1 IgG2a IgG2b IgG2c and IgG3.

The immunoglobulins and other polypeptides used herein may be from any animal origin including birds and mammals. Preferably the antibodies are human rodent e.g. mouse and rat donkey sheep rabbit goat guinea pig camel horse or chicken. As used herein human antibodies include antibodies having the amino acid sequence of a human immunoglobulin and include antibodies isolated from human immunoglobulin libraries or from animals transgenic for one or more human immunoglobulin and that do not express endogenous immunoglobulins as described infra and for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 939 598 by Kucherlapati et al.

The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific bispecific trispecific or of greater multispecificity. Multispecific antibodies may be specific for different epitopes of a polypeptide or may be specific for heterologous epitopes such as a heterologous polypeptide or solid support material. See e.g. PCT publications WO 93 17715 WO 92 08802 WO 91 00360 WO 92 05793 Tutt et al. 147 60 69 1991 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 474 893 4 714 681 4 925 648 5 573 920 5 601 819 Kostelny et al. 148 1547 1553 1992.

Multispecific antibodies have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. While such molecules normally will only bind two antigens i.e. bispecific antibodies BsAbs antibodies with additional specificities such as trispecific antibodies are encompassed by the instant invention. Examples of BsAbs include without limitation those with one arm directed against a tumor cell antigen and the other arm directed against a cytotoxic molecule.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the coexpression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. Nature 305 537 539 1983 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. EMBO J. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. Methods in Enzymology 121 210 1986 . According to another approach described in WO96 27011 a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the CH3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. See e.g. Tutt et al. 1991 J. Immunol. 147 60 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are otherwise modified i.e. by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody such that covalent attachment does not prevent the antibody from binding antigen and or generating an anti idiotypic response. For example but not by way of limitation the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin etc. Additionally the derivative may contain one or more non classical amino acids.

For some uses including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays it may be preferable to use chimeric humanized or human antibodies. A chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions of the antibody are derived from different animal species such as antibodies having a variable region derived from a murine monoclonal antibody and a constant region derived from a human immunoglobulin. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. 4 214 1986 Gillies et al. 125 191 202 1989 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 807 715 4 816 567 and 4 816 397 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species that bind the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and framework regions and constant domains from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 Riechmann et al. 332 323 1988 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including for example CDR grafting EP 239 400 PCT publication WO 91 09967 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 225 539 5 530 101 and 5 585 089 veneering or resurfacing EP 592 106 EP 519 596 Padlan 28 4 5 489 498 1991 Studnicka et al. 7 6 805 814 1994 Roguska et al. 91 969 973 1994 and chain shuffling U.S. Pat. No. 5 565 332 all of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. Humanized antibodies may be generated using any of the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 444 887 and 4 716 111 and PCT publications WO 98 46645 WO 98 50433 WO 98 24893 WO 98 16654 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 and WO 91 10741 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar 13 65 93 1995. For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies see e.g. PCT publications WO 98 24893 WO 92 01047 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 European Patent No. 0 598 877 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 413 923 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 569 825 5 661 016 5 545 806 5 814 318 5 885 793 5 916 771 and 5 939 598 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. In addition companies such as Abgenix Inc. Freemont Calif. Medarex N.J. and Genpharm San Jose Calif. can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.

Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as guided selection. In this approach a selected non human monoclonal antibody e.g. a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope Jespers et al. 12 899 903 1988 .

The invention encompasses engineering human or humanized therapeutic antibodies e.g. tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in the Fc region by modification e.g. substitution insertion deletion of at least one amino acid residue which modification confers an effector function activity e.g. enhanced ADCC activity phagocytosis activity etc. as determined by standard assays known to those skilled in the art. The engineered therapeutic antibodies may further have increased affinity of the Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA. In other embodiments the engineered therapeutic antibodies may exhibit oligomerization activity mediated by the variant Fc region. In another embodiment the invention relates to engineering human or humanized therapeutic antibodies e.g. tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in the Fc region by modification of at least one amino acid residue which modification increases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA and further decreases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc RIIB.

In another specific embodiment the invention encompasses engineering an monoclonal antibody by modification e.g. substitution insertion deletion of at least one amino acid residue in the Fc region which modification confers an effector function as determined by standard assays known in the art and disclosed and exemplified herein. In another embodiment modification of the monoclonal antibody increases the affinity of the Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA. In another specific embodiment modification of the monoclonal antibody may also further decrease the affinity of the Fc region for Fc RIIB.

5.2 Screening of Molecules with Variant Fc Regions for Effector Function Enhanced Fc RIII Binding and Characterization of Same

The affinities and binding properties of the molecules of the invention for an Fc R are initially determined using in vitro assays biochemical or immunological based assays known in the art for determining Fc Fc R interactions i.e. specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R including but not limited to ELISA assay surface plasmon resonance assay immunoprecipitation assays. Preferably the binding properties of the molecules of the invention are also characterized by in vitro functional assays for determining one or more Fc R mediator effector cell functions. In most preferred embodiments the antibodies of the invention have similar binding properties in in vivo models such as those described and disclosed herein as those in in vitro based assays. However the present invention does not exclude molecules of the invention that do not exhibit the desired phenotype in in vitro based assays but do exhibit the desired phenotype in vivo.

In preferred embodiments screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc R affinities e.g. enhanced Fc RIIIA affinity are done using the yeast display technology as described herein in combination with one or more biochemical based assays preferably in a high throughput manner. In some embodiments screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc R affinities e.g. enhanced Fc RIIIA affinity are done using the yeast display technology as described herein in combination with one or more functional based assays preferably in a high throughput manner. The functional based assays can be any assay known in the art for characterizing one or more Fc R mediated effector cell functions such as those described herein in Section 5.2.7. Non limiting examples of effector cell functions that can be used in accordance with the methods of the invention include but are not limited to antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC antibody dependent phagocytosis phagocytosis opsonization opsonophagocytosis cell binding rosetting C1q binding and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity.

The term specific binding of an Fc region to an Fc R refers to an interaction of the Fc region and a particular Fc R which has an affinity constant of at least about 150 nM in the case of monomeric Fc RIIIA and at least about 60 nM in the case of dimeric Fc RIIB as determined using for example an ELISA or surface plasmon resonance assay e.g. a BIAcore . The affinity constant of an Fc region for monomeric Fc RIIIA may be 150 nM 200 nM or 300 nM. The affinity constant of an Fc region for dimeric Fc RIIB may be 60 nM 80 nM 90 nM or 100 nM. Dimeric Fc RIIB for use in the methods of the invention may be generated using methods known to one skilled in the art. Typically the extracellular region of Fc RIIB is covalently linked to a heterologous polypeptide which is capable of dimerization so that the resulting fusion protein is a dimer e.g. see U.S. Application No. 60 439 709 filed on Jan. 13 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A specific interaction generally is stable under physiological conditions including for example conditions that occur in a living individual such as a human or other vertebrate or invertebrate as well as conditions that occur in a cell culture such conditions as used for maintaining and culturing mammalian cells or cells from another vertebrate organism or an invertebrate organism.

The present invention encompasses engineering methods to generate Fc variants including but not limited to computational design strategies library generation methods and experimental production and screening methods. These strategies may be applied individually or in various combinations to engineer the Fc variants of the instant invention.

In most preferred embodiments the engineering methods of the invention comprise methods in which amino acids at the interface between an Fc region and the Fc ligand are not modified. Fc ligands include but are not limited to Fc Rs C1q FcRn C3 mannose receptor protein A protein G mannose receptor and undiscovered molecules that bind Fc. Amino acids at the interface between an Fc region and an Fc ligand is defined as those amino acids that make a direct and or indirect contact between the Fc region and the ligand play a structural role in determining the conformation of the interface or are within at least 3 angstroms preferably at least 2 angstroms of each other as determined by structural analysis such as x ray crystallography and molecular modeling The amino acids at the interface between an Fc region and an Fc ligand include those amino acids that make a direct contact with an Fc R based on crystallographic and structural analysis of Fc Fc R interactions such as those disclosed by Sondermann et al. 2000 Nature 406 267 273 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . Examples of positions within the Fc region that make a direct contact with Fc R are amino acids 234 239 hinge region amino acids 265 269 B C loop amino acids 297 299 C E loop and amino acids 327 332 F G loop. In some embodiments the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprise modification of at least one residue that does not make a direct contact with an Fc R based on structural and crystallographic analysis e.g. is not within the Fc Fc R binding site.

Preferably the engineering methods of the invention do not modify any of the amino acids as identified by Shields et al . which are located in the CH2 domain of an Fc region proximal to the hinge region e.g. Leu234 Pro238 Ala327 Pro329 and affect binding of an Fc region to all human Fc Rs.

In other embodiments the invention encompasses Fc variants with altered Fc R affinities and or altered effector functions such that the Fc variant does not have an amino acid modification at a position at the interface between an Fc region and the Fc ligand. Preferably such Fc variants in combination with one or more other amino acid modifications which are at the interface between an Fc region and the Fc ligand have a further impact on the particular altered property e.g. altered Fc R affinity. Modifying amino acids at the interface between Fc and an Fc ligand may be done using methods known in the art for example based on structural analysis of Fc ligand complexes. For example but not by way of limitation by exploring energetically favorable substitutions at Fc positions that impact the binding interface variants can be engineered that sample new interface conformations some of which may improve binding to the Fc ligand some of which may reduce Fc ligand binding and some of which may have other favorable properties. Such new interface conformations could be the result of for example direct interaction with Fc ligand residues that form the interface or indirect effects caused by the amino acid modifications such as perturbation of side chain or backbone conformations

The invention encompasses conformational and compositional changes in the N297 carbohydrate that result in a desired property for example increased or reduced affinity for an Fc R. Such modifications may further enhance the phenotype of the original amino acid modification of the Fc variants of the invention. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of actions such a strategy is supported by the observation that the carbohydrate structure and conformation dramatically affect Fc Fc R and Fc C1 q binding Umaha et aL 1999 Nat Biotechnol 17 176 180 Davies et aL 2001 Biotechnol Bioeng 74 288 294 Mimura et aL 2001 J Biol Chem 276 45539 Radaev et aL 2001 J Biol Chem 276 16478 16483 Shields et aL 2002 J Biol Chem 277 26733 26740 Shinkawa et aL 2003 J Biol Chem 278 3466 3473 .

Another design strategy for generating Fc variants in accordance with the invention is provided in which the Fc region is reengineered to eliminate the structural and functional dependence on glycosylation. This design strategy involves the optimization of Fc structure stability solubility and or Fc function for example affinity of Fc for one or more Fc ligands in the absence of the N297 carbohydrate. In one approach positions that are exposed to solvent in the absence of glycosylation are engineered such that they are stable structurally consistent with Fc structure and have no tendency to aggregate. Approaches for optimizing aglycosylated Fc may involve but are not limited to designing amino acid modifications that enhance aglycosylated Fc stability and or solubility by incorporating polar and or charged residues that face inward towards the Cg2 Cg2 dimer axis and by designing amino acid modifications that directly enhance the aglycosylated Fc Fc R interface or the interface of aglycosylated Fc with some other Fc ligand.

The Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other Fc modifications including but not limited to modifications that enhance effector function. The invention encompasses combining an Fc variant of the invention with other Fc modifications to provide additive synergistic or novel properties in antibodies or Fc fusions. Such modifications may be in the CH1 CH2 or CH3 domains or a combination thereof. Preferably the Fc variants of the invention enhance the property of the modification with which they are combined. For example if an Fc variant of the invention is combined with a mutant known to bind Fc RIIIA with a higher affinity than a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region the combination with a mutant of the invention results in a greater fold enhancement in Fc RIIIA affinity.

In one embodiment the Fc variants of the present invention may be combined with other known Fc variants such as those disclosed in Duncan et al 1988 Nature 332 563 564 Lund et al. 1991 J. Immunol 147 2657 2662 Lund et al 1992 Mol Immunol 29 53 59 Alegre et al 1994 Transplantation 57 1537 1543 Hutchins et al. 1995 Proc Natl.

An Fc R Fc binding assay was developed for determining the binding of the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions to Fc R which allowed detection and quantization of the interaction despite the inherently weak affinity of the receptor for its ligand e.g. in the micro molar range for Fc RIIB and Fc RIIIA. The method involves the formation of an Fc R complex that has an improved avidity for an Fc region relative to an uncompleted Fc R. According to the invention the preferred molecular complex is a tetrameric immune complex comprising a the soluble region of Fc R e.g. the soluble region of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIA or Fc RIIB b a biotinylated 15 amino acid AVITAG peptide sequence operably linked to the C terminus of the soluble region of Fc R e.g. the soluble region of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIA or Fc RIIB and c streptavidin phycoerythrin SA PE in a molar ratio to form a tetrameric Fc R complex preferably in a 5 1 molar ratio . According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the fusion protein is biotinylated enzymatically using for example the Bir A enzyme a biotin ligase which specifically biotinylates a lysine residue in the 15 amino acid AVITAG peptide sequence. In a specific embodiment of the invention 85 of the fusion protein is biotinylated as determined by standard methods known to those skilled in the art including but not limited to streptavidin shift assay. According to preferred embodiments of the invention the biotinylated soluble Fc R proteins are mixed with SA PE in a 1 SA PE 5 biotinylated soluble Fc R molar ratio to form a tetrameric Fc R complex.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention molecules comprising Fc regions bind the tetrameric Fc R complexes formed according to the methods of the invention with at least an 8 fold higher affinity than the monomeric uncomplexed Fc R. The binding of polypeptides comprising Fc regions to the tetrameric Fc R complexes may be determined using standard techniques known to those skilled in the art such as for example fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS radioimmunoassays ELISA assays etc.

The invention encompasses the use of the immune complexes formed according to the methods described above for determining the functionality of molecules comprising an Fc region in cell based or cell free assays.

As a matter of convenience the reagents may be provided in an assay kit i.e. a packaged combination of reagents for assaying the ability of molecules comprising variant Fc regions to bind Fc R tetrameric complexes. Other forms of molecular complexes for use in determining Fc Fc R interactions are also contemplated for use in the methods of the invention e.g. fusion proteins formed as described in U.S. Provisional Application 60 439 709 filed on Jan. 13 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Molecular interactions between the IgG Fc and Fc receptors have been previously studied by both structural and genetic techniques. These studies identified amino acid residues that are critical for functional binding of Fc to different Fc R. None of these changes have been shown to improve human Fc R mediated efficacy of therapeutic antibodies in animal models. A complete analysis of all potential amino acid changes at these residues or other potentially important residues has not been reported. The platform described herein has the ability to both construct mutant libraries with all possible amino acid changes screen libraries using multiple functional assays and finally analyze libraries in relevant humanized animal models.

The instant invention encompasses construction of multiple libraries based on both genetic and structural data known in the art or being developed. The method described and exemplified herein incorporates building individual libraries that contain mutants testing all 20 amino acid changes at between 3 6 residues in the Fc region. The complete set of mutations will be assembled in all possible combinations of mutations. The number of independent mutations generated is based on the number of sites being saturated during library assembly Table 9 below . Library size will determine the choice of primary screen and therefore the choice of vector for initial cloning steps.

The instant invention encompasses construction of combinatorial libraries focusing on a limited number of critical residues e.g. 3 6 . Using a library of randomly mutagenized IgG1 Fc and the screening assays described and exemplified herein Fc variants will be identified. In the initial rounds the best 5 mutations based on both FcR binding profile and functional activity will be selected. It will take 20individual mutants to cover all possible amino acid changes and their combinations at five locations. A library with at least 10 fold coverage for each mutant will be generated. In addition regions will be chosen based on available information e.g. crystal structure data Mouse Human isotype Fc R binding differences genetic data and additional sites identified by mutagenesis.

The biggest disadvantage of current site directed mutagenic protocols is production of bias populations over representing variations in some regions and under representing or completely lacking mutations in others. The present invention overcomes this problem by generating unbiased arrays of desirable Fc mutants using a well developed gene building technology to eliminate the bias introduced in library construction by PCR based approaches such as overlapping PCR and inverted PCR. The key distinctions of the approach of the present invention are 1 Employment of equimolar mix of 20 individual oligos for every targeted codon instead of degenerated primers. This way each amino acid is represented by a single most used codon whereas degenerated primers over represent those amino acids encoded by more codons over those encoded by fewer codons. 2 Building mutants by a chain replacement approach. This insures unbiased introduction of all desirable changes into the final product.

An exemplary protocol comprises of the following steps 1 phosphorylated oligos representing desirable changes at one or several locations all complementary to the same strand added to the template along with a thermostable 5 3 exonuclease deficient DNA polymerase and ligase . 2 assembled mix undergoes a number of polymerization ligation cycles sufficient to generate desirable amount of product. Use of a 5 3 exonuclease deficient DNA polymerase insures integrity of the primer sequence and its phosphate residue when a thermostable ligase assembles individual primer extended fragments into a contiguous single stranded chain. Reaction cycles can continue until complete exhaustion of the oligos pool without introducing bias into the final product . 3 generated pool of single stranded mutants is converted into double stranded DNA by adding a reverse gene specific primer to the reaction . 4 double stranded product gets digested at the end designed restriction sites and cloned into an appropriate expression vector 

To insure quality of the library PCR amplified fragments will be analyzed by electrophoresis to determine the length of the final PCR products. The reaction will be characterized as successful if 99 of the PCR products are of the expected length. The final library will be cloned into an expression vector. A fraction of the mutant library will be sequenced to determine the rate of mutant codon incorporation. The number of fragments sequenced will be based on the number of target sites mutated and library validation will be determined by the observed rate of mutation at targeted sites Table 10 . The rate of vector without inserts should be less than 2 . The rate of mutation at non targeted sites should be less than 8 . Libraries containing clones with 90 correct inserts will allow us to maintain screening timelines.

In other embodiments the invention the invention encompasses overlapping or inverted PCR for construction of libraries. In order to remain unbiased individual primers for each codon will be used rather than degenerative primers. A similar validation scheme as disclosed supra will be employed.

Most preferably automated protocols will be employed for high throughput library production. Automation allows for improved throughput walk away operation and an overall reduction in experimental error for tasks requiring tedious repetitive operations. Oligo synthesis capabilities is based on 2 Mermade DNA synthesizers Bioautomation Inc. with a total output capability of 575 60 mer Oligos 12 hrs. Proprietary software handles all aspects of design synthesis and storage of the final oligonucleotides. Robotic liquid handlers will be employed to set up oligos for synthesis of full length Fc mutants and ligation reactions for incorporating the mutant Fcs into antibody heavy chain expression vectors will be set up. After ligation it is estimated that it would take 1 FTE 10 days to array the library clones and generate 8000 minipreps equivalent to a combinatorial library saturated at 3 sites. Subsequent to bacterial transformation a Qpix 2 clone picker robot will be used for picking colonies into 96 deep well plates. Culture growth will be done using a magnetic levitation stirrer capable of incubating 12 plates and resulting in dense growth in 12 16 hr at 37 C. A Qiagen miniprep robot will be used to perform DNA preps at the rate of 4 96 well plates in 2.5 hrs. By overlapping tasks 5 such libraries could be constructed in 9 months with 1 FTE.

Affinity maturation requires the assembly of a new set of combinations of mutations from a preselected mutant pool or members of a gene family which can be enriched by a selection protocol. The process is repeated several times until the isolation of a mutant with the desired phenotype is achieved. The disadvantage of the current enzymatic approach DNA shuffling to accomplish this process is bias which can be introduced due to specific sites within gene that are hot spots for nucleases dominance of specific mutants in the final reassembled pool and loss of some of the original mutants in the final pool. In order to overcome this shortcoming a build a gene BAG technology will be used to generate a highly complex library of Fc mutants containing random amino acid changes at all potential locations that may be important for receptor s binding. Sets of degenerated oligos covering specific regions of the IgG Fc will be used See .

Oligos will be 30 nt and degenerate oligos synthesized to change one 4 oligos or two AAs 8 oligos will be constructed. The oligos are designed to be overlapping with no gaps. It will take 200 oligos to accommodate all single AA changes and 2000 to change two AAs per oligonucleotide. All 2000 oligos will be used individually and in combinations to generate arrays of Fc mutants using the protocol outlined above A.20 . We will use a home written randomizer program and a robotic liquid handler for pooling selected combinations of mutant and wild type oligos. Large libraries will be cloned into vectors that will allow for screening using yeast surface display. This approach utilizes a magnetic bead selection followed by flow cytometry and has been successfully applied to libraries with a complexity 10 Feldhaus et al. 2003 Nat. Biotech. 21 2 163 170 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . This limits the number of sites to test at any one pool to 7 resulting in 1.3 10possible mutations pool.

To insure quality of the library PCR amplified fragments will be analyzed by electrophoresis to determine the length of the final PCR products. The reaction will be characterized as successful if 99 of the PCR products are of the expected length. A fraction of the mutant library will be sequenced to determine the rate of mutant codon incorporation. The number of fragments sequenced will be based on the number of target sites mutated and library validation will be determined by the observed rate of mutation at targeted sites Table 10 . The rate of vectors without inserts should be less than 2 . The rate of mutation at non targeted sites should be less than 8 .

The ability to generate the desired level of efficiency of mutagenesis by this approach will be determined by sequencing of a subset of clones. The alternative to BAG will be using a DNA shuffle protocol. This requires pooling all of the mutants single double triple etc. Following DNA preparation Fc regions will be amplified by PCR using flanking primers that selectively amplify the mutated region of the Fc 700 bp. Novel mutants are constructed by reshuffling of mutations in the Fc via DNAseI treatment of the amplified DNA and isolation of 150 200 bp fragments see e.g. Stemmer et al. 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 91 10747 51 . Fragments will be religated PCR amplified with nested primers and cloned into the yeast surface display vector pYD1. The recombined library will be reselected in the yeast Fc display screen as described and exemplified herein.

BAG libraries will utilize most of the same equipment as the combinatorial library. However cloning will be in a vector suitable for yeast surface display and will not require arraying of individual clones as the yeast surface display will initially be employed for enrichment of large libraries. Subsequent to the appropriate level of enrichment individual clones will be arrayed.

An initial library of molecules comprising variant Fc regions is produced using any random based mutagenesis techniques known in the art. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that amino acid sequence variants of Fc regions may be obtained by any mutagenesis technique known to those skilled in the art. Some of these techniques are briefly described herein however it will be recognized that alternative procedures may produce an equivalent result. In a preferred embodiment molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions are prepared by error prone PCR as exemplified in Example 6 infra See Leung et al. 1989 1 11 . It is especially preferred to have error rates of 2 3 bp Kb for use in the methods of the invention. In one embodiment using error prone PCR a mutation frequency of 2 3 mutations kb is obtained.

Mutagenesis may be performed in accordance with any of the techniques known in the art including but not limited to synthesizing an oligonucleotide having one or more modifications within the sequence of the Fc region of an antibody or a polypeptide comprising an Fc region e.g. the CH2 or CH3 domain to be modified. Site specific mutagenesis allows the production of mutants through the use of specific oligonucleotide sequences which encode the DNA sequence of the desired mutation as well as a sufficient number of adjacent nucleotides to provide a primer sequence of sufficient size and sequence complexity to form a stable duplex on both sides of the deletion junction being traversed. Typically a primer of about 30 to about 45 nucleotides or more in length is preferred with about 10 to about 25 or more residues on both sides of the junction of the sequence being altered. A number of such primers introducing a variety of different mutations at one or more positions may be used to generated a library of mutants.

The technique of site specific mutagenesis is well known in the art as exemplified by various publications see e.g. Kunkel et al. 154 367 82 1987 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety . In general site directed mutagenesis is performed by first obtaining a single stranded vector or melting apart of two strands of a double stranded vector which includes within its sequence a DNA sequence which encodes the desired peptide. An oligonucleotide primer bearing the desired mutated sequence is prepared generally synthetically. This primer is then annealed with the single stranded vector and subjected to DNA polymerizing enzymes such as T7 DNA polymerase in order to complete the synthesis of the mutation bearing strand. Thus a heteroduplex is formed wherein one strand encodes the original non mutated sequence and the second strand bears the desired mutation. This heteroduplex vector is then used to transform or transfect appropriate cells such as cells and clones are selected which include recombinant vectors bearing the mutated sequence arrangement. As will be appreciated the technique typically employs a phage vector which exists in both a single stranded and double stranded form. Typical vectors useful in site directed mutagenesis include vectors such as the M13 phage. These phage are readily commercially available and their use is generally well known to those skilled in the art. Double stranded plasmids are also routinely employed in site directed mutagenesis which eliminates the step of transferring the gene of interest from a plasmid to a phage.

Alternatively the use of PCR with commercially available thermostable enzymes such as Taq DNA polymerase may be used to incorporate a mutagenic oligonucleotide primer into an amplified DNA fragment that can then be cloned into an appropriate cloning or expression vector. See e.g. Tomic et al. 18 6 1656 1987 and Upender et al. 18 1 29 30 32 1995 for PCR mediated mutagenesis procedures which are hereby incorporated in their entireties. PCR employing a thermostable ligase in addition to a thermostable polymerase may also be used to incorporate a phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotide into an amplified DNA fragment that may then be cloned into an appropriate cloning or expression vector see e.g. Michael 16 3 410 2 1994 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety .

Another method for preparing variants for use in the invention is cassette mutagenesis based on the technique described by Wells et al. 1985 34 315 . The starting material is the plasmid comprising the desired DNA encoding the protein to be mutated e.g. the DNA encoding a polypeptide comprising an Fc region . The codon s in the DNA sequence to be mutated are identified there must be a unique restriction endonuclease site on each side of the identified mutations site s . If no such restriction site exits it may be generated by oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis. After the restriction sites have been introduced into the plasmid the plasmid is cut at these sites and linearized. A double stranded oligonucleotide encoding the sequence of the DNA between the restriction sites but containing the mutation is synthesized using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art. The double stranded oligonucleotide is referred to as the cassette. This cassette is designed to have 3 and 5 ends that are compatible with the ends of the linearized plasmid such that it can be directly ligated to the plasmid.

Other methods known to those of skill in the art for producing sequence variants of the Fc region of an antibody or polypeptides comprising an Fc region can be used. For example recombinant vectors encoding the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of an antibody or a fragment thereof may be treated with mutagenic agents such as hydroxylamine to obtain sequence variants.

Once a mutant library is produced according to the methods described the mutagenized library is transformed into a yeast strain preferably EBY100 Invitrogen MATa ura3 52 trpl leu2 1 his3 200 pep4 HIS3 prb1 1.6R can1 GAL GAL AGA1 using a standard lithium acetate transformation protocol known to those skilled in the art.

It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that once molecules of the invention with desired effector function and or binding properties e.g. molecules with variant Fc regions with at least one amino acid modification which modification confers ADCC activity or enhances the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA relative to a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region have been identified See Section 5.1 and Table 2 according to the methods of the invention other molecules i.e therapeutic antibodies may be engineered using standard recombinant DNA techniques and any known mutagenesis techniques as described in this section to produce engineered molecules carrying the identified mutation sites.

The preferred method for screening and identifying molecules comprising variant Fc regions with altered Fc R affinities i.e. enhanced Fc RIIIA affinity and or Fc RIIA is yeast surface display technology for review see Boder and Wittrup 2000 328 430 444 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety which addresses the deficiency in the prior art for screening binding interactions of extracellular post translationally modified proteins. Specifically the yeast surface display is a genetic method whereby polypeptides comprising Fc mutants are expressed on the yeast cell wall in a form accessible for interacting with Fc R. Yeast surface display of the mutant Fc containing polypeptides of the invention may be performed in accordance with any of the techniques known to those skilled in the art. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 423 538 6 114 147 and 6 300 065 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. See Boder et al. 1997 15 553 7 Boder et al. 1998 14 55 62 Boder et al. 2000 328 430 44 Boder et al. 2000 2000 97 10701 5 Shusta et al. 1998 1998 16 773 7 Shusta et al. 1999 292 949 56 Shusta et al. 1999 10 117 22 Shusta et al. 2000 18 754 9 Wittrup et al. 1994 745 321 30 Wittrup et al. 1994 16 206 13 Wittrup 1995 6 203 8 Wittrup 1999 17 423 4 Wittrup 2000 18 1039 40 Wittrup 2001 12 395 9.

Yeast Surface Display will be used to enrich libraries containing 10independent clones. This approach will provide the ability to enrich large libraries 20 fold in single sort. Fc mutant libraries with 10 000 independent mutants 4 or more sites will be cloned into the appropriate vectors for yeast surface display and enriched by FACS sorting until 

The invention provides methods for constructing an Fc mutant library in yeast for displaying molecules comprising Fc regions which have been mutated as described in Section 5.2.2. Preferably the Fc mutant libraries for use in the methods of the invention contain at least 10cells up to 10cells. One exemplary method for constructing a Fc library for use in the methods of the invention comprises the following nucleic acids encoding molecules comprising Fc regions are cloned into the multiple cloning site of a vector derived from a yeast replicating vector e.g. pCT302 such that the Fc encoding nucleic acids are expressed under the control of the GAL1 galactose inducible promoter and in frame with a nucleotide sequence encoding Aga2p the mating agglutinin cell wall protein. In a preferred embodiment nucleic acids encoding molecules comprising Fc regions are cloned C terminal to the Aga2p coding region such that a Fc region Aga2p fusion protein is encoded. A fusion protein comprising the Aga2p protein and polypeptides comprising Fc regions will be secreted extracellularly and displayed on the cell wall via disulfide linkage to the Aga1p protein an integral cell wall protein using the preferred construct of the invention. In an alternative embodiment the constructs may further comprise nucleotide sequences encoding epitope tags. Any epitope tag nucleotide coding sequence known to those skilled in the art can be used in accordance with the invention including but not limited to nucleotide sequences encoding hemagglutinin HA c myc Xpress TAG His TAG or V5TAG. The presence of the fusion protein on the yeast cell surface may be detected using FACS analysis confocal fluorescence microscopy or standard immunostaining methods all of which are known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment the presence of the Fc fusion proteins of the invention on the yeast cell surface are detected using Fc specific monoclonal antibodies CH3 specific including but not limited to IgG1 Fc specific monoclonal antibody HP6017 Sigma JL512 Immunotech and any antibody disclosed in Partridge et al. 1986 23 12 1365 72 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In another embodiment the presence of the Fc fusion proteins of the invention are detected by immunofluorescent labeling of epitope tags using techniques known to those skilled in the art. It is particularly useful in the methods of the invention to use nucleotide sequences encoding epitope tags to flank the nucleic acids encoding the Fc fusion proteins as an internal control to detect if the fusion proteins are displayed on the cell wall in a partially proteolyzed form.

The invention encompasses screening the yeast display libraries using immunological based assays including but not limited to cell based assays solution based assays and solid phase based assays.

In some embodiments the invention encompasses identification of Fc mutants with altered Fc R affinities using affinity maturation methods which are known to those skilled in the art and encompassed herein. Briefly affinity maturation creates novel alleles by randomly recombining individual mutations present in a mutant library see e.g. Hawkins et al. 1992 226 889 896 Stemmer et al. 1994 370 389 91 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. It has been used successfully to increase the affinity of antibodies T cell receptors and other proteins. The invention encompasses using mutations that show increased Fc R binding as a baseline to construct new mutant libraries with enhanced phenotypes. Using the methods of the invention a population of IgG1 Fc mutants enriched by yeast surface display for increased binding to an Fc R e.g. Fc RIIIA may be selected. Following DNA preparation Fc regions can be amplified by PCR using flanking primers that selectively amplify the mutated region of the Fc which is about 700 bp using methods known to one skilled in the art and exemplified or disclosed herein. Novel mutants can thus be constructed by reshuffling of mutations in the Fc region for example via DNAseI treatment of the amplified DNA and isolation of fragments using methods such as those disclosed by Stemmer et al. 1994 91 10747 51 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Fragments can then be religated PCR amplified with nested primers and cloned into the yeast display vector e.g. pYD1 using methods known to one skilled in the art. The recombined library can then be reselected in the yeast Fc display screen. As the Kdecreases below 10 nM conditions can be established to allow for further increases in affinity based on the reduction of the off rate of the Fc RIIIA ligand from the Fc receptor using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in Boder et al. 1998 14 55 62 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The invention encompasses a kinetic screen of the yeast library. A kinetic screen may be established by labeling of the Fc displaying cells to saturation with a labeled ligand e.g. a fluorescent ligand followed by incubation with an excess of non labeled ligand for a predetermined period. After termination of the reaction by the addition of excess buffer e.g. 1 PBS 0.5 mg ml BSA cells will be analyzed by FACS and sort gates set for selection. After each round of enrichment individual mutants can be tested for fold increases in affinity and sequenced for diversity. The in vitro recombination process can be repeated. In some embodiments the in vitro recombination process is repeated at least 3 times.

Selection of the Fc variants of the invention may be done using any Fc R including but not limited to polymorphic variants of Fc R. In some embodiments selection of the Fc variants is done using a polymorphic variant of Fc RIIIA which contains a phenylalanine at position 158. In other embodiments selection of the Fc variants is done using a polymorphic variant of Fc RIIIA which contains a valine at position 158. Fc RIIIA 158V displays a higher affinity for IgG1 than 158F and an increased ADCC activity see e.g. Koene et al. 1997 90 1109 14 Wu et al. 1997 100 1059 70 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties this residue in fact directly interacts with the lower hinge region of IgG1 as recently shown by IgG1 Fc RIIIA co crystallization studies see e.g. Sonderman et al. 2000 100 1059 70 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Studies have shown that in some cases therapeutic antibodies have improved efficacy in Fc RIIIA 158V homozygous patients. Therapeutic antibodies may also be more effective in patients heterozygous for Fc RIIIA 158V and Fc RIIIA 158F and in patients with Fc RIIA H131.

The invention encompasses screening yeast libraries based on Fc RIIB depletion and Fc RIIIA selection so that Fc mutants are selected that not only have an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIIA but also have a reduced affinity for Fc RIIB. Yeast libraries may be enriched for clones that have a reduced affinity for Fc RIIB by sequential depletion methods for example by incubating the yeast library with magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIB. Fc RIIB depletion is preferably carried out sequentially so that the library is enriched in clones that have a reduced affinity for Fc RIIB. In some embodiments the Fc RIIB depletion step results in a population of cells so that only 30 preferably only 10 more preferably only 5 most preferably less than 1 bind Fc RIIB. In some embodiments Fc RIIB depletion is carried out in at least 3 cycles at least 4 cycles at least 6 cycles. The Fc RIIB depletion step is preferably combined with an Fc RIIIIA selection step for example using FACS sorting so that Fc variants with an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIIA are selected.

The invention encompasses characterization of the mutant Fc fusion proteins that are displayed on the yeast surface cell wall according to the methods described in Section 5.2.3. One aspect of the invention provides a method for selecting mutant Fc fusion proteins with a desirable binding property specifically the ability of the mutant Fc fusion protein to bind Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region binds Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA. In another embodiment the invention provides a method for selecting mutant Fc fusion proteins with a desirable binding property specifically the ability of the mutant Fc fusion protein to bind Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA with a greater affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region binds Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA and further the ability of the mutant Fc fusion protein to bind Fc RIIB with a lower affinity than a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region binds Fc RIIB. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the methods of the invention can be used for identifying and screening any mutations in the Fc regions of molecules with any desired binding characteristic.

Yeast cells displaying the mutant Fc fusion proteins can be screened and characterized by any biochemical or immunological based assays known to those skilled in the art for assessing binding interactions.

Preferably fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS using any of the techniques known to those skilled in the art is used for screening the mutant Fc fusion proteins displayed on the yeast cell surface for binding Fc RIIIA preferably the Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex or optionally Fc RIIB. Flow sorters are capable of rapidly examining a large number of individual cells that contain library inserts e.g. 10 100 million cells per hour Shapiro et al. 1995 . Additionally specific parameters used for optimization including but not limited to ligand concentration i.e. Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex kinetic competition time or FACS stringency may be varied in order to select for the cells which display Fc fusion proteins with specific binding properties e.g. higher affinity for Fc RIIIA compared to a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region. Flow cytometers for sorting and examining biological cells are well known in the art. Known flow cytometers are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 347 935 5 464 581 5 483 469 5 602 039 5 643 796 and 6 211 477 the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. Other known flow cytometers are the FACS Vantage system manufactured by Becton Dickinson and Company and the COPAS system manufactured by Union Biometrica.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention yeast cells are analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS . In most preferred embodiments the FACS analysis of the yeast cells is done in an iterative manner at least twice at least three times or at least 5 times. Between each round of selection cells are regrown and induced so the Fc regions are displayed on the maximum number of yeast cell surfaces. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mode of action this iterative process helps enrich the population of the cells with a particular phenotype e.g. high binding to Fc RIIIA.

In preferred embodiments screening for Fc variants of the invention comprises a selection process that has multiple rounds of screening e.g. at least two rounds of screening. In one embodiment screening for Fc variants that have an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA may comprise the following steps in the first round of screening a library of yeast cells e.g. a naive library of 10cells is enriched by FACS preferably in an iterative manner using for example labeled tetrameric Fc RIIIA to select for Fc variants that have an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA the variant Fc region that is selected with the desired phenotype e.g. enhanced binding to Fc RIIIA is then introduced into an antibody e.g. a 4 4 20 antibody and the engineered antibody is assayed using a secondary screen e.g. ELISA for binding to an Fc R. In the second round of screening a single mutation library may be generated based on the first screen so that the Fc region harbors the variant displaying the enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA and enriched by FACS using for example labeled monomeric Fc RIIIA in both the presence and absence of unlabeled receptor and the variant Fc region is then introduced into an antibody e.g. a 4 4 20 antibody and the engineered antibody is assayed using a secondary screen e.g. ELISA for binding to an Fc R. In some embodiments the secondary screen may further comprise characterizing the antibodies comprising Fc variants in an ADCC or BIAcore based assay using methods disclosed herein

The invention encompasses FACS screening of the mutant yeast library under equilibrium or kinetic conditions. When the screening is performed under equilibrium conditions an excess of the yeast library carrying Fc mutants is incubated with Fc RIIIA preferably labeled Fc RIIIA at a concentration 5 10 fold below the Kd for at least one hour to allow binding of Fc mutants to Fc RIIIA under equilibrium conditions. When the screening is performed under kinetic conditions the mutant yeast library is incubated with labeled Fc RIIIA the cells are then incubated with equimolar unlabeled Fc RIIIA for a pre selected time bound Fc RIIIA is then monitored.

One exemplary method of analyzing the yeast cells expressing mutant Fc fusion proteins with FACS is costaining the cells with Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex which has been labeled with a fluorescent label such as PE and an anti Fc antibody such as F ab anti Fc which has been fluorescently labeled. Fluorescence measurements of a yeast library produced according to the methods of the invention preferably involves comparisons with controls for example yeast cells that lack the insert encoding molecules comprising an Fc region negative control . The flow sorter has the ability not only to measure fluorescence signals in cells at a rapid rate but also to collect cells that have specified fluorescent properties. This feature may be employed in a preferred embodiment of the invention to enrich the initial library population for cells expressing Fc fusion proteins with specific binding characteristics e.g. higher affinity for Fc RIIIA compared to a comparable polypeptide comprising a wild type Fc region. In a preferred embodiment of the invention yeast cells are analyzed by FACS and sort gates established to select for cells that show the highest affinity for Fc RIIIA relative to the amount of Fc expression on the yeast cell surface. According to a preferred embodiment four consecutive sorts are established wherein the gates for each successive sort is 5.5 1 0.2 and 0.1 . It is preferred that the yeast display library formed according to the methods of the invention be over sampled by at least 10 fold to improve the probability of isolating rare clones e.g. analyze 10cells from a library of 10clones . Alternatively 2 5 sorts are established to select for cells of the desired phenotype. Sort gates can be established empirically by one skilled in the art.

In other preferred embodiments mutant Fc fusion proteins displayed on the yeast cell surface are screened using solid phase based assays for example assays using magnetic beads e.g. supplied by Dynal preferably in a high through put manner for binding to an Fc R e.g. Fc RIIIA. In one embodiment magnetic bead assays may be used to identify mutants with enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA and or reduced affinity for Fc RIIB. An exemplary assay to identify mutants with enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA and reduced affinity for Fc RIIB may comprise selecting mutants by a sequential solid phase depletion using magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIB followed by selection with magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIIA. For example one assay may comprise the following steps incubating the library of yeast cells generated in accordance with the methods of the invention with magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIB separating yeast cells bound to beads from the non bound fraction by placing the mixture in a magnetic field removing the non bound yeast cells and placing them in a fresh media binding the yeast cells to beads coated with Fc RIIIA separating yeast cells bound to beads from the non bound fraction by placing the mixture in a magnetic field removing the non bound yeast cells removing the bound cells by rigorous vortexing growing the recovered cells in glucose containing media re inducing in selective media containing galactose. The selection process is repeated at least once. Inserts containing the Fc domain are then amplified using common methodologies known in the art e.g. PCR and introduced into an antibody by methods already described for further characterization.

In an alternative embodiment a non yeast based system is used to characterize the binding properties of the molecules of the invention. One exemplary system for characterizing the molecules of the invention comprises a mammalian expression vector containing the heavy chain of the anti fluorescein monoclonal antibody 4 4 20 into which the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention with variant Fc regions are cloned. The resulting recombinant clone is expressed in a mammalian host cell line i.e. human kidney cell line 293H and the resulting recombinant immunoglobulin is analyzed for binding to Fc R using any standard assay known to those in the art including but not limited to ELISA and FACS.

Molecules of the present invention may be characterized in a variety of ways. In particular molecules of the invention comprising modified Fc regions may be assayed for the ability to immunospecifically bind to a ligand e.g. Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex. Such an assay may be performed in solution e.g. Houghten 13 412 421 1992 on beads Lam 354 82 84 1991 on chips Fodor 364 555 556 1993 on bacteria U.S. Pat. No. 5 223 409 on spores U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 698 5 403 484 and 5 223 409 on plasmids Cull et al. 89 1865 1869 1992 or on phage Scott and Smith 249 386 390 1990 Devlin 249 404 406 1990 Cwirla et al. 87 6378 6382 1990 and Felici 222 301 310 1991 each of these references is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Molecules that have been identified to immunospecifically bind to an ligand e.g. Fc RIIIA can then be assayed for their specificity and affinity for the ligand.

Molecules of the invention that have been engineered to comprise modified Fc regions e.g. therapeutic antibodies or have been identified in the yeast display system to have the desired phenotype see Section 5.1 may be assayed for immunospecific binding to an antigen e.g. cancer antigen and cross reactivity with other antigens e.g. Fc R by any method known in the art. Immunoassays which can be used to analyze immunospecific binding and cross reactivity include but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art see e.g. Ausubel et al. eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

The binding affinity of the molecules of the present invention comprising modified Fc regions to a ligand e.g. Fc R tetrameric complex and the off rate of the interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled ligand such as tetrameric Fc R e.g. H or I with a molecule of interest e.g. molecules of the present invention comprising modified Fc regions in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled ligand such as tetrameric Fc R and the detection of the molecule bound to the labeled ligand. The affinity of the molecule of the present invention for the ligand and the binding off rates can be determined from the saturation data by scatchard analysis.

In a preferred embodiment BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of molecules of the present invention to a ligand such as Fc R. BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of a ligand from chips with immobilized molecules e.g. molecules comprising modified Fc regions on their surface.

Any of a variety of sequencing reactions known in the art can be used to directly sequence the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions. Examples of sequencing reactions include those based on techniques developed by Maxim and Gilbert 74 560 1977 or Sanger 74 5463 1977 . It is also contemplated that any of a variety of automated sequencing procedures can be utilized 19 448 1995 including sequencing by mass spectrometry see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 94 16101 Cohen et al. 36 127 162 1996 and Griffin et al. 38 147 159 1993 .

The invention encompasses characterization of the molecules of the invention e.g. an antibody comprising a variant Fc region identified by the yeast display technology described supra or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies engineered according to the methods of the invention using assays known to those skilled in the art for identifying the effector cell function of the molecules. In particular the invention encompasses characterizing the molecules of the invention for Fc R mediated effector cell function. Examples of effector cell functions that can be assayed in accordance with the invention include but are not limited to antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity phagocytosis opsonization opsonophagocytosis C1q binding and complement dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Any cell based or cell free assay known to those skilled in the art for determining effector cell function activity can be used For effector cell assays see Perussia et al. 2000 121 179 92 Baggiolini et al. 1998 44 10 841 8 Lehmann et al. 2000 243 1 2 229 42 Brown E J. 1994 45 147 64 Munn et al. 1990 172 231 237 Abdul Majid et al. 2002 55 70 81 Ding et al. 1998 8 403 411 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

In one embodiment the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc R mediated phagocytosis in human monocytes. Alternatively the Fc R mediated phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention may be assayed in other phagocytes e.g. neutrophils polymorphonuclear leuckocytes PMN human peripheral blood monocytes monocyte derived macrophages which can be obtained using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art e.g. see Brown E J. 1994 45 147 164 . In one embodiment the function of the molecules of the invention is characterized by measuring the ability of THP 1 cells to phagocytose fluoresceinated IgG opsonized sheep red blood cells SRBC by methods previously described Tridandapani et al. 2000 275 20480 7 . For example an exemplary assay for measuring phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions with enhanced affinities for Fc RIIIA comprises of treating THP 1 cells with a molecule of the invention or with a control antibody that does not bind to Fc RIIIA comparing the activity levels of said cells wherein a difference in the activities of the cells e.g. rosetting activity the number of THP 1 cells binding IgG coated SRBC adherence activity the total number of SRBC bound to THP 1 cells and phagocytic rate would indicate the functionality of the molecule of the invention. It can be appreciated by one skilled in the art that this exemplary assay can be used to assay any of the molecules identified by the methods of the invention.

Another exemplary assay for determining the phagocytosis of the molecules of the invention is an antibody dependent opsonophagocytosis assay ADCP which can comprise the following coating a target bioparticle such as labeled FITC Molecular Probes or FITC with i wild type 4 4 20 antibody an antibody to fluorescein See Bedzyk et al. 1989 J. 264 3 1565 1569 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as the control antibody for Fc R dependent ADCP or ii 4 4 20 antibody harboring the D265A mutation that knocks out binding to Fc RIII as a background control for Fc R dependent ADCP iii 4 4 20 antibody carrying variant Fc regions identified by the methods of the invention and produced as exemplified in Example 6.6 and forming the opsonized particle adding any of the opsonized particles described i iii to THP 1 effector cells a monocytic cell line available from ATCC at a 1 1 10 1 30 1 60 1 75 1 or 100 1 ratio to allow Fc R mediated phagocytosis to occur preferably incubating the cells and FITC antibody at 37 C. for 1.5 hour adding trypan blue after incubation preferably at room temperature for 2 3 min. to the cells to quench the fluoroscence of the bacteria that are adhered to the outside of the cell surface without being internalized transferring cells into a FACS buffer e.g. 0.1 BSA in PBS 0.1 sodium azide analyzing the fluorescence of the THP1 cells using FACS e.g. BD FACS Calibur . Preferably the THP 1 cells used in the assay are analyzed by FACS for expression of Fc R on the cell surface. THP 1 cells express both CD32A and CD64. CD64 is a high affinity Fc R that is blocked in conducting the ADCP assay in accordance with the methods of the invention. The THP 1 cells are preferably blocked with 100 g mL soluble IgG1 or 10 human serum. To analyze the extent of ADCP the gate is preferably set on THP 1 cells and median fluorescence intensity is measured. The ADCP activity for individual mutants is calculated and reported as a normalized value to the wild type chMab 4 4 20 obtained. The opsonized particles are added to THP 1 cells such that the ratio of the opsonized particles to THP 1 cells is 30 1 or 60 1. In most preferred embodiments the ADCP assay is conducted with controls such as FITC in medium FITC and THP 1 cells to serve as Fc R independent ADCP activity FITC THP 1 cells and wild type 4 4 20 antibody to serve as Fc R dependent ADCP activity FITC THP 1 cells 4 4 20 D265A to serve as the background control for Fc R dependent ADCP activity .

In another embodiment the molecules of the invention can be assayed for Fc R mediated ADCC activity in effector cells e.g. natural killer cells using any of the standard methods known to those skilled in the art See e.g. Perussia et al. 2000 121 179 92 Weng et al. 2003 J. Clin. Oncol. 21 3940 3947 . An exemplary assay for determining ADCC activity of the molecules of the invention is based on a Cr release assay comprising of labeling target cells with Cr NaCrO this cell membrane permeable molecule is commonly used for labeling since it binds cytoplasmic proteins and although spontaneously released from the cells with slow kinetics it is released massively following target cell necrosis opsonizing the target cells with the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions combining the opsonized radiolabeled target cells with effector cells in a microtitre plate at an appropriate ratio of target cells to effector cells incubating the mixture of cells for 16 18 hours at 37 C. collecting supernatants and analyzing radioactivity. The cytotoxicity of the molecules of the invention can then be determined for example using the following formula lysis experimental cpm target leak cpm detergent lysis cpm target leak cpm 100 . Alternatively lysis ADCC AICC maximum release spontaneous release . Specific lysis can be calculated using the formula specific lysis lysis with the molecules of the invention lysis in the absence of the molecules of the invention. A graph can be generated by varying either the target effector cell ratio or antibody concentration.

In yet another embodiment the molecules of the invention are characterized for antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC see e.g. Ding et al. 1998 8 403 11 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Preferably the effector cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention are peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC that are preferably purified from normal human blood using standard methods known to one skilled in the art e.g. using Ficoll Paque density gradient centrifugation. Preferred effector cells for use in the methods of the invention express different Fc R activating receptors. The invention encompasses effector cells THP 1 expressing Fc RI Fc RIIA and Fc RIIB and monocyte derived primary macrophages derived from whole human blood expressing both Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB to determine if Fc antibody mutants show increased ADCC activity and phagocytosis relative to wild type IgG1 antibodies.

The human monocyte cell line THP 1 activates phagocytosis through expression of the high affinity receptor Fc RI and the low affinity receptor Fc RIIA Fleit et al. 1991 J. Leuk. Biol. 49 556 . THP 1 cells do not constitutively express Fc RIIA or Fc RIIB. Stimulation of these cells with cytokines effects the FcR expression pattern Pricop et al. 2000 J. Immunol. 166 531 7 . Growth of THP 1 cells in the presence of the cytokine IL4 induces Fc RIIB expression and causes a reduction in Fc RIIA and Fc RI expression. Fc RIIB expression can also be enhanced by increased cell density Tridandapani et al. 2002 277 5082 9 . In contrast it has been reported that IFN can lead to expression of Fc RIIIA Pearse et al. 1993 90 4314 8 . The presence or absence of receptors on the cell surface can be determined by FACS using common methods known to one skilled in the art. Cytokine induced expression of Fc R on the cell surface provides a system to test both activation and inhibition in the presence of Fc RIIB. If THP 1 cells are unable to express the Fc RIIB the invention also encompasses another human monocyte cell line U937. These cells have been shown to terminally differentiate into macrophages in the presence of IFN and TNF Koren et al. 1979 279 328 331 .

Fc R dependent tumor cell killing is mediated by macrophage and NK cells in mouse tumor models Clynes et al. 1998 95 652 656 . The invention encompasses the use of elutriated monocytes from donors as effector cells to analyze the efficiency Fc mutants to trigger cell cytotoxicity of target cells in both phagocytosis and ADCC assays. Expression patterns of Fc RI Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB are affected by different growth conditions. Fc R expression from frozen elutriated monocytes fresh elutriated monocytes monocytes maintained in 10 FBS and monocytes cultured in FBS GM CSF and or in human serum may be determined using common methods known to those skilled in the art. For example cells can be stained with Fc R specific antibodies and analyzed by FACS to determine FcR profiles. Conditions that best mimic macrophage in vivo Fc R expression is then used for the methods of the invention.

In some embodiments the invention encompasses the use of mouse cells especially when human cells with the right Fc R profiles are unable to be obtained. In some embodiments the invention encompasses the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 ATCC which can be transfected with human Fc RIIIA and stable transfectants isolated using methods known in the art see e.g. Ralph et al. J. 119 950 4 . Transfectants can be quantitated for Fc RIIIA expression by FACS analysis using routine experimentation and high expressors can be used in the ADCC assays of the invention. In other embodiments the invention encompasses isolation of spleen peritoneal macrophage expressing human Fc R from knockout transgenic mice such as those disclosed herein.

Lymphocytes may be harvested from peripheral blood of donors PBM using a Ficoll Paque gradient Pharmacia . Within the isolated mononuclear population of cells the majority of the ADCC activity occurs via the natural killer cells NK containing Fc RIIIA but not Fc RIIB on their surface. Results with these cells indicate the efficacy of the mutants on triggering NK cell ADCC and establish the reagents to test with elutriated monocytes.

Target cells used in the ADCC assays of the invention include but are not limited to breast cancer cell lines e.g. SK BR 3 with ATCC accession number HTB 30 see e.g. Tremp et al. 1976 33 41 B lymphocytes cells derived from Burkitts lymphoma e.g. Raji cells with ATCC accession number CCL 86 see e.g. Epstein et al. 1965 34 231 240 and Daudi cells with ATCC accession number CCL 213 see e.g. Klein et al. 1968 28 1300 10 . The target cells must be recognized by the antigen binding site of the immunoglobulin to be assayed.

The ADCC assay is based on the ability of NK cells to mediate cell death via an apoptotic pathway. NK cells mediate cell death in part by Fc RIIIA s recognition of IgG bound to an antigen on a cell surface. The ADCC assays used in accordance with the methods of the invention may be radioactive based assays or fluorescence based assays. The ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises labeling target cells e.g. SK BR 3 MCF 7 OVCAR3 Raji Daudi cells opsonizing target cells with an antibody that recognizes a cell surface receptor on the target cell via its antigen binding site combining the labeled opsonized target cells and the effector cells at an appropriate ratio which can be determined by routine experimentation harvesting the cells detecting the label in the supernatant of the lysed target cells using an appropriate detection scheme based on the label used. The target cells may be labeled either with a radioactive label or a fluorescent label using standard methods known in the art. For example the labels include but are not limited to Cr NaCrO and the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand 2 2 6 2 terpyridine 6 6 dicarboxylate TDA .

In a specific preferred embodiment a time resolved fluorimetric assay is used for measuring ADCC activity against target cells that have been labeled with the acetoxymethyl ester of the fluorescence enhancing ligand 2 2 6 2 terpyridine 6 6 dicarboxylate TDA . Such fluorimetric assays are known in the art e.g. see Blomberg et al. 1996 193 199 206 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly target cells are labeled with the membrane permeable acetoxymethyl diester of TDA bis acetoxymethyl 2 2 6 2 terpyridine 6 6 dicarboxylate BATDA which rapidly diffuses across the cell membrane of viable cells. Intracellular esterases split off the ester groups and the regenerated membrane impermeable TDA molecule is trapped inside the cell. After incubation of effector and target cells e.g. for at least two hours up to 3.5 hours at 37 C. under 5 CO the TDA released from the lysed target cells is chelated with Eu3 and the fluorescence of the Europium TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time resolved fluorometer e.g. Victor 1420 Perkin Elmer Wallac .

In another specific embodiment the ADCC assay used to characterize the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions comprises the following steps Preferably 4 5 10target cells e.g. SK BR 3 MCF 7 OVCAR3 Raji cells are labeled with bis acetoxymethyl 2 2 6 2 terpyridine t 6 dicarboxylate DELFIA BATDA Reagent Perkin Elmer Wallac . For optimal labeling efficiency the number of target cells used in the ADCC assay should preferably not exceed 5 10. BATDA reagent is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at 37 C. preferably under 5 CO for at least 30 minutes. The cells are then washed with a physiological buffer e.g. PBS with 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole and media containing 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole. The labeled target cells are then opsonized coated with a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region i.e. an immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region of the invention including but not limited to a polyclonal antibody a monoclonal antibody a bispecific antibody a multi specific antibody a humanized antibody or a chimeric antibody. In preferred embodiments the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region used in the ADCC assay is specific for a cell surface receptor a tumor antigen or a cancer antigen. The immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention is introduced may specifically bind any cancer or tumor antigen such as those listed in section 5.4. Additionally the immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention is introduced may be any therapeutic antibody specific for a cancer antigen such as those listed in section 5.4. In some embodiments the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region used in the ADCC assay is an anti fluoresceine monoclonal antibody 4 4 20 Kranz et al. 1982 257 12 6987 6995 a mouse human chimeric anti CD20 monoclonal antibody 2H7 Liu et al. 1987 139 3521 6 or a humanized antibody Ab4D5 against the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 p185 HER2 Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 9 . The target cells in the ADCC assay are chosen according to the immunoglobulin into which a variant Fc region of the invention has been introduced so that the immunoglobulin binds a cell surface receptor of the target cell specifically. Preferably the ADCC assays of the invention are performed using more than one engineered antibody e.g. anti Her2 neu 4 4 20 2B6 RITUXAN and 2H7 harboring the Fc variants of the invention. In a most preferred embodiment the Fc variants of the invention are introduced into at least 3 antibodies and their ADCC activities are tested. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action examining at least 3 antibodies in these functional assays will diminish the chance of eliminating a viable Fc mutation erroneously.

Target cells are added to effector cells e.g. PBMC to produce effector target ratios of approximately 1 1 10 1 30 1 50 1 75 1 or 100 1. In a specific embodiment when the immunoglobulin comprising a variant Fc region has the variable domain of 4 4 20 the effector target is 75 1. The effector and target cells are incubated for at least two hours up to 3.5 hours at 37 C. under 5 CO. Cell supernatants are harvested and added to an acidic europium solution e.g. DELFIA Europium Solution Perkin Elmer Wallac . The fluorescence of the Europium TDA chelates formed is quantitated in a time resolved fluorometer e.g. Victor 1420 Perkin Elmer Wallac . Maximal release MR and spontaneous release SR are determined by incubation of target cells with 1 TX 100 and media alone respectively. Antibody independent cellular cytotoxicity AICC is measured by incubation of target and effector cells in the absence of antibody. Each assay is preferably performed in triplicate. The mean percentage specific lysis is calculated as Experimental release ADCC AICC MR SR 100.

The invention encompasses characterization of the Fc variants in both NK dependent and macrophage dependent ADCC assays. Fc variants of the invention have altered phenotypes such as an altered effector function as assayed in an NK dependent or macrophage dependent assay.

The invention encompasses assays known in the art and exemplified herein to bind C1q and mediate complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC . To determine C1q binding a C1q binding ELISA may be performed. An exemplary assay may comprise the following assay plates may be coated overnight at 4 C. with polypeptide variant or starting polypeptide control in coating buffer. The plates may then be washed and blocked. Following washing an aliquot of human C1q may be added to each well and incubated for 2 hrs at room temperature. Following a further wash 100 uL of a sheep anti complement C1q peroxidase conjugated antibody may be added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The plate may again be washed with wash buffer and 100 ul of substrate buffer containing OPD O phenylenediamine dihydrochloride Sigma may be added to each well. The oxidation reaction observed by the appearance of a yellow color may be allowed to proceed for 30 minutes and stopped by the addition of 100 ul of 4.5 NHSO. The absorbance may then read at 492 405 nm.

A preferred variant in accordance with the invention is one that displays a significant reduction in C1q binding as detected and measured in this assay or a similar assay. Preferably the molecule comprising an Fc variant displays about 50 fold reduction about 60 fold about 80 fold or about 90 fold reduction in C1q binding compared to a control antibody having a nonmutated IgG1 Fc region. In the most preferred embodiment the molecule comprising an Fc variant does not bind C1q i.e. the variant displays about 100 fold or more reduction in C1q binding compared to the control antibody.

Another exemplary variant is one which has a better binding affinity for human C1q than the molecule comprising wild type Fc region. Such a molecule may display for example about two fold or more and preferably about five fold or more improvement in human C1q binding compared to the parent molecule comprising wild type Fc region. For example human C1q binding may be about two fold to about 500 fold and preferably from about two fold or from about five fold to about 1000 fold improved compared to the molecule comprising wild type Fc region.

To assess complement activation a complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC assay may be performed e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 1996 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly various concentrations of the molecule comprising a variant Fc region and human complement may be diluted with buffer. Cells which express the antigen to which the molecule comprising a variant Fc region binds may be diluted to a density of about 1 10cells ml. Mixtures of the molecule comprising a variant Fc region diluted human complement and cells expressing the antigen may be added to a flat bottom tissue culture 96 well plate and allowed to incubate for 2 hrs at 37 C. and 5 COto facilitate complement mediated cell lysis. 50 uL of alamar blue Accumed International may then be added to each well and incubated overnight at 37 C. The absorbance is measured using a 96 well fluorometer with excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm. The results may be expressed in relative fluorescence units RFU . The sample concentrations may be computed from a standard curve and the percent activity as compared to nonvariant molecule i.e. a molecule comprising wild type Fc region is reported for the variant of interest.

In some embodiments an Fc variant of the invention does not activate complement. Preferably the variant does not appear to have any CDC activity in the above CDC assay. The invention also pertains to a variant with enhanced CDC compared to a parent molecule a molecule comprising wild type Fc region e.g. displaying about two fold to about 100 fold improvement in CDC activity in vitro or in vivo e.g. at the IC50 values for each molecule being compared . Complement assays may be performed with guinea pig rabbit or human serum. Complement lysis of target cells may be detected by monitoring the release of intracellular enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase LDH as described in Korzeniewski et al. 1983 64 3 313 20 and Decker et al. 1988 115 1 61 9 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety or the release of an intracellular lable such as europium chromium 51 or indium 111 in which target cells are labeled as described herein.

The molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions may also be assayed using any surface plasmon resonance based assays known in the art for characterizing the kinetic parameters of Fc Fc R interaction binding. Any SPR instrument commercially available including but not limited to BIAcore Instruments available from Biacore AB Uppsala Sweden IAsys instruments available from Affinity Sensors Franklin Mass.

Nos. 6 373 577 6 289 286 5 322 798 5 341 215 and 6 268 125 are contemplated in the methods of the invention all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Briefly SPR based assays involve immobilizing a member of a binding pair on a surface and monitoring its interaction with the other member of the binding pair in solution in real time. SPR is based on measuring the change in refractive index of the solvent near the surface that occurs upon complex formation or dissociation. The surface onto which the immobilization occur is the sensor chip which is at the heart of the SPR technology it consists of a glass surface coated with a thin layer of gold and forms the basis for a range of specialized surfaces designed to optimize the binding of a molecule to the surface. A variety of sensor chips are commercially available especially from the companies listed supra all of which may be used in the methods of the invention. Examples of sensor chips include those available from BIAcore AB Inc. e.g. Sensor Chip CM5 SA NTA and HPA. A molecule of the invention may be immobilized onto the surface of a sensor chip using any of the immobilization methods and chemistries known in the art including but not limited to direct covalent coupling via amine groups direct covalent coupling via sulfhydryl groups biotin attachment to avidin coated surface aldehyde coupling to carbohydrate groups and attachment through the histidine tag with NTA chips.

In some embodiments the kinetic parameters of the binding of a molecule of the invention comprising variant Fc regions e.g. immunoglobulins comprising variant Fc region to an Fc R may be determined using a BIAcore instrument e.g. BIAcore instrument 1000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . Any Fc R can be used to assess the interaction with the molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions. In a specific embodiment the Fc R is Fc RIIIA preferably a soluble monomeric Fc RIIIA. For example in one embodiment the soluble monomeric Fc RIIIA is the extracellular region of Fc RIIIA joined to the linker AVITAG sequence see U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 439 498 filed on Jan. 9 2003 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 456 041 filed on Mar. 19 2003 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . In another specific embodiment the Fc R is Fc RIIB preferably a soluble dimeric Fc RIIB. For example in one embodiment the soluble dimeric Fc RIIB protein is prepared in accordance with the methodology described in U.S. Provisional application No. 60 439 709 filed on Jan. 13 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

An exemplary assay for determining the kinetic parameters of a molecule comprising a variant Fc region wherein the molecule is the 4 4 20 antibody to an Fc R using a BIAcore instrument comprises the following BSA FITC is immobilized on one of the four flow cells of a sensor chip surface preferably through amine coupling chemistry such that about 5000 response units RU of BSA FITC is immobilized on the surface. Once a suitable surface is prepared 4 4 20 antibodies carrying the Fc mutations are passed over the surface preferably by one minute injections of a 20 g mL solution at a 5 L mL flow rate. The level of 4 4 20 antibodies bound to the surface ranges between 400 and 700 RU. Next dilution series of the receptor Fc RIIA and Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein in HBS P buffer 20 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCl 3 mM EDTA pH 7.5 are injected onto the surface at 100 L min Antibody regeneration between different receptor dilutions is carried out preferably by single 5 second injections of 100 mM NaHCOpH 9.4 3M NaCl. Any regeneration technique known in the art is contemplated in the method of the invention.

Once an entire data set is collected the resulting binding curves are globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the SPR instrument manufacturer e.g. BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . These algorithms calculate both the Kand K from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant Kd is deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants i.e. K K . More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . The analysis of the generated data may be done using any method known in the art. For a review of the various methods of interpretation of the kinetic data generated see Myszka 1997 8 50 7 Fisher et al. 1994 5 389 95 O Shannessy 1994 5 65 71 Chaiken et al. 1992 201 197 210 Morton et al. 1995 227 176 85 O Shannessy et al. 1996 236 275 83 all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

In preferred embodiments the kinetic parameters determined using an SPR analysis e.g. BIAcore may be used as a predictive measure of how a molecule of the invention will function in a functional assay e.g. ADCC. An exemplary method for predicting the efficacy of a molecule of the invention based on kinetic parameters obtained from an SPR analysis may comprise the following determining the Kvalues for binding of a molecule of the invention to Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB plotting 1 K wt K mut for Fc RIIIA 2 K mut K wt for Fc RIIB against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one show a decreased dissociation rate for Fc RIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for Fc RIIB relative to wild type and possess and enhanced ADCC function.

The present invention also includes polynucleotides that encode the molecules including the polypeptides and antibodies of the invention identified by the methods of the invention. The polynucleotides encoding the molecules of the invention may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art.

Once the nucleotide sequence of the molecules e.g. antibodies that are identified by the methods of the invention is determined the nucleotide sequence may be manipulated using methods well known in the art e.g. recombinant DNA techniques site directed mutagenesis PCR etc. see for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 2001 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 John Wiley Sons NY which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties to generate for example antibodies having a different amino acid sequence for example by generating amino acid substitutions deletions and or insertions.

In a specific embodiment when the nucleic acids encode antibodies one or more of the CDRs are inserted within framework regions using routine recombinant DNA techniques. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions and preferably human framework regions see e.g. Chothia et al. 1998 278 457 479 for a listing of human framework regions .

In another embodiment human libraries or any other libraries available in the art can be screened by standard techniques known in the art to clone the nucleic acids encoding the molecules of the invention.

Once a nucleic acid sequence encoding molecules of the invention i.e. antibodies has been obtained the vector for the production of the molecules may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the coding sequences for the molecules of the invention and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. See for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 John Wiley Sons NY .

An expression vector comprising the nucleotide sequence of a molecule identified by the methods of the invention i.e. an antibody can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques e.g. electroporation liposomal transfection and calcium phosphate precipitation and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the molecules of the invention. In specific embodiments the expression of the molecules of the invention is regulated by a constitutive an inducible or a tissue specific promoter.

The host cells used to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention may be either bacterial cells such as or preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant immunoglobulin molecule. In particular mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins Foecking et al. 1998 45 101 Cockett et al. 1990 8 2 .

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the molecules identified by the methods of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the molecules of the invention may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express the molecules of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. and transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing coding sequences for the molecules identified by the methods of the invention yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing the sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV and tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing sequences encoding the molecules identified by the methods of the invention or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 293T 3T3 cells lymphotic cells see U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 715 Per C.6 cells human retinal cells developed by Crucell harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter .

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. 1983 2 1791 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye 1985 13 3101 3109 Van Heeke Schuster 1989 24 5503 5509 and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions e.g. the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter e.g. the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts e.g. see Logan Shenk 1984 81 355 359 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. 1987 153 51 544 .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK Hela COS MDCK 293 293T 3T3 W138 BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT20 and T47D CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express an antibody of the invention may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibodies of the invention. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibodies of the invention.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. 1977 11 223 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski 1992 48 202 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al. 1980 22 817 genes can be employed in tk hgprt or aprt cells respectively. Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler et al. 1980 77 357 O Hare et al. 1981 78 1527 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg 1981 78 2072 neo which confers resistance to the aminoglycoside G 418 12 488 505 Wu and Wu 1991 3 87 95 Tolstoshev 1993 32 573 596 Mulligan 1993 260 926 932 and Morgan and Anderson 1993 62 191 217 May 1993 11 5 155 215 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. eds. 1993 John Wiley Sons NY Kriegler 1990 Stockton Press NY and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds 1994 John Wiley Sons NY. Colberre Garapin et al. 1981 150 1 and hygro which confers resistance to hygromycin Santerre et al. 1984 30 147 .

The expression levels of an antibody of the invention can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel Vol. 3 Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing an antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the nucleotide sequence of the antibody production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. 1983 3 257 .

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot 1986 322 52 Kohler 1980 77 2197 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

Once a molecule of the invention has been recombinantly expressed it may be purified by any method known in the art for purification of polypeptides or antibodies for example by chromatography e.g. ion exchange affinity particularly by affinity for the specific antigen after Protein A and sizing column chromatography centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique for the purification of polypeptides or antibodies.

The molecules of the invention with conferred effector function activity are particularly useful for the treatment and or prevention of a disease disorder or infection where an enhanced efficacy of effector cell function e.g. ADCC mediated by Fc R is desired e.g. cancer infectious disease and in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of therapeutic antibodies the effect of which is mediated by an effector function activity e.g. ADCC.

The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment prevention or management of a cancer in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising a variant Fc region engineered in accordance with the invention which molecule further binds a cancer antigen. Molecules of the invention comprising the variant Fc regions are particularly useful for the prevention inhibition reduction of growth or regression of primary tumors metastasis of cancer cells and infectious diseases. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action molecules of the invention enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics by enhancing antibody mediated effector function resulting in an enhanced rate of tumor clearance or an enhanced rated of tumor reduction or a combination thereof. In alternate embodiments the modified antibodies of the invention enhance the efficacy of cancer therapeutics by conferring oligomerization activity to variant Fc region resulting in cross linking of cell surface antigens and or receptors and enhanced apoptosis or negative growth regulatory signaling.

According to an aspect of the invention immunotherapeutics may be enhanced by modifying the Fc region in accordance with the invention to confer or increase the potency of an antibody effector function activity e.g. ADCC CDC phagocytosis opsonization etc. of the immunotherapeutic. In a specific embodiment antibody dependent cellular toxicity and or phagocytosis of tumor cells or infected cells is enhanced by modifying immunotherapeutics with variant Fc regions of the invention. Molecules of the invention may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by enhancing at least one antibody mediated effector function activity. In one particular embodiment the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment is enhanced by enhancing the complement dependent cascade. In another embodiment of the invention the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment is enhanced by enhancing the phagocytosis and or opsonization of the targeted cells e.g. tumor cells. In another embodiment of the invention the efficacy of treatment is enhanced by enhancing antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC in destruction of the targeted cells e.g. tumor cells. The molecules of the invention may make an antibody that does not have a therapeutic effect in patients or in a subpopulation of patients have a therapeutic effect.

Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action therapeutic antibodies engineered in accordance with the invention have enhanced therapeutic efficacy in part due to the ability of the Fc portion of the antibody to bind a target cell which expresses the particular Fc Rs at reduced levels for example by virtue of the ability of the antibody to remain on the target cell longer due to an improved off rate for Fc R interaction.

The antibodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for Fc Rs are particularly useful for the treatment prevention or management of a cancer or another disease or disorder in a subject wherein the Fc Rs are expressed at low levels in the target cell populations. As used herein Fc R expression in cells is defined in terms of the density of such molecules per cell as measured using common methods known to those skilled in the art. The molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions preferably also have a conferred or an enhanced avidity and affinity and or effector function in cells which express a target antigen e.g. a cancer antigen at a density of 30 000 to 20 000 molecules cell at a density of 20 000 to 10 000 molecules cell at a density of 10 000 molecules cell or less at a density of 5000 molecules cell or less or at a density of 1000 molecules cell or less. The molecules of the invention have particular utility in treatment prevention or management of a disease or disorder such as cancer in a sub population wherein the target antigen is expressed at low levels in the target cell population.

The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with other therapeutic agents known in the art for the treatment or prevention of diseases such as cancer autoimmune disease inflammatory disorders and infectious diseases. In a specific embodiment molecules of the invention may be used in combination with monoclonal or chimeric antibodies lymphokines or hematopoietic growth factors such as e.g. IL 2 IL 3 and IL 7 which for example serve to increase the number or activity of effector cells which interact with the molecules and increase immune response. The molecules of the invention may also be advantageously utilized in combination with one or more drugs used to treat a disease disorder or infection such as for example anti cancer agents anti inflammatory agents or anti viral agents e.g. as detailed in sections 5.4.1.2 and 5.4.2.1 below.

The invention encompasses methods and compositions for treatment or prevention of cancer in a subject comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more molecules comprising a variant Fc region. In some embodiments the invention encompasses methods and compositions for the treatment or prevention of cancer in a subject with Fc R polymorphisms such as those homozygous for the F RIIIA 158V or Fc RIIIA 158F alleles. In some embodiments the invention encompasses engineering therapeutic antibodies e.g. tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the methods of the invention such that the engineered antibodies have enhanced efficacy in patients homozygous for the low affinity allele of Fc RIIIA 158F . In other embodiments the invention encompasses engineering therapeutic antibodies e.g. tumor specific monoclonal antibodies in accordance with the methods of the invention such that the engineered antibodies have enhanced efficacy in patients homozygous for the high affinity allele of Fc RIIIA 158V .

The efficacy of monoclonal antibodies may depend on the Fc R polymorphism of the subject Carton et al. 2002 99 754 8 Weng et al. 2003 21 21 3940 7 both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties . These receptors are expressed on the surface of the effector cells and mediate ADCC. High affinity alleles of the low affinity activating receptors improve the effector cells ability to mediate ADCC. The methods of the invention allow engineering molecules harboring Fc mutations to enhance their affinity to Fc R on effector cells via their altered Fc domains. The engineered antibodies of the invention provide better immunotherapy reagents for patients regardless of their Fc R polymorphism.

Molecules harboring the Fc variants are tested by ADCC using either a cultured cell line or patient derived PMBC cells to determine the ability of the Fc mutations to enhance ADCC. Standard ADCC is performed using methods disclosed herein. Lymphocytes are harvested from peripheral blood using a Ficoll Paque gradient Pharmacia . Target cells i.e. cultured cell lines or patient derived cells are loaded with Europium PerkinElmer and incubated with effectors for 4 hrs at 37 C. Released Europium is detected using a fluorescent plate reader Wallac . The resulting ADCC data indicates the efficacy of the Fc variants to trigger NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and establish which Fc variants can be tested with both patient samples and elutriated monocytes. Fc variants showing the greatest potential for enhancing the efficacy of the molecule are then tested in an ADCC assay using PBMCs from patients. PBMC from healthy donors are used as effector cells.

According to an aspect of the invention molecules of the invention comprising variant Fc regions enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy by conferring or increasing the potency of an antibody effector function relative to a molecule containing the wild type Fc region e.g. ADCC CDC phagocytosis opsonization etc. In a specific embodiment antibody dependent cellular toxicity and or phagocytosis of tumor cells is conferred or enhanced using the molecules of the invention with variant Fc regions. Molecules of the invention may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy cancer treatment by conferring or enhancing at least one antibody mediated effector function. In one particular embodiment a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region confers or enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by enhancing the complement dependent cascade. In another embodiment of the invention the molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy treatment by conferring or enhancing the phagocytosis and or opsonization of the targeted tumor cells. In another embodiment of the invention the molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region enhances the efficacy of treatment by conferring or enhancing antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC in destruction of the targeted tumor cells.

The invention further contemplates engineering therapeutic antibodies e.g. tumor specific monoclonal antibodies for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic antibody for example by enhancing the effector function of the therapeutic antibody e.g. ADCC or conferring effector function to a therapeutic antibody which doesn t have that effector function at least detectable in an in vitro or in vivo assay . Preferably the therapeutic antibody is a cytotoxic and or opsonizing antibody. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that once molecules of the invention with desired binding properties e.g. molecules with variant Fc regions with at least one amino acid modification which modification enhances the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA relative to a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region have been identified See Section 5.2 and Table 8 according to the methods of the invention therapeutic antibodies may be engineered using standard recombinant DNA techniques and any known mutagenesis techniques as described in Section 5.2.2 to produce engineered therapeutic carrying the identified mutation sites with the desired binding properties. Any of the therapeutic antibodies listed in Table 9 that have demonstrated therapeutic utility in cancer treatment may be engineered according to the methods of the invention for example by modifying the Fc region to confer an effector function or have an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA compared to a therapeutic antibody having a wild type Fc region.

The Fc variants of the invention may be incorporated into therapeutic antibodies such as those disclosed herein or other Fc fusion clinical candidates i.e. a molecule comprising an Fc regions which has been approved for us in clinical trials or any other molecule that may benefit from the Fc variants of the instant invention humanized affinity matured modified or engineered versions thereof.

The invention also encompasses engineering any other polypeptide comprising an Fc region which has therapeutic utility including but not limited to ENBREL according to the methods of the invention in order to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of such polypeptides for example by enhancing the effector function of the polypeptide comprising an Fc region.

Accordingly the invention provides methods of preventing or treating cancer characterized by a cancer antigen using a therapeutic antibody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic and has been modified at one or more sites in the Fc region according to the invention to bind Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA with a higher affinity than the parent therapeutic antibody and or mediates one or more effector functions e.g. ADCC phagocytosis either not detectably mediated by the parent antibody or more effectively than the parent antibody. In another embodiment the invention provides methods of preventing or treating cancer characterized by a cancer antigen using a therapeutic antibody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic and has been engineered according to the invention to bind Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA with a higher affinity and bind Fc RIIB with a lower affinity than the parent therapeutic antibody and or mediates one or more effector functions e.g. ADCC phagocytosis either not detectably mediated by the parent antibody or more effectively than the parent antibody. The therapeutic antibodies that have been engineered according to the invention are useful for prevention or treatment of cancer since they have an enhanced cytotoxic activity e.g. enhanced tumor cell killing and or enhanced for example ADCC activity or CDC activity .

Cancers associated with a cancer antigen may be treated or prevented by administration of a therapeutic antibody that binds a cancer antigen and is cytotoxic and has been engineered according to the methods of the invention to have for example a conferred or an enhanced effector function. In one particular embodiment the therapeutic antibodies engineered according to the methods of the invention enhance the antibody mediated cytotoxic effect of the antibody directed at the particular cancer antigen. For example but not by way of limitation cancers associated with the following cancer antigens may be treated or prevented by the methods and compositions of the invention KS pan carcinoma antigen Perez and Walker 1990 142 32 37 Bumal 1988 7 4 407 415 ovarian carcinoma antigen CA125 Yu et al. 1991 51 2 48 475 prostatic acid phosphate Tailor et al. 1990 18 1 4928 prostate specific antigen Henttu and Vihko 1989 10 2 903 910 Israeli et al. 1993 53 227 230 melanoma associated antigen p97 Estin et al. 1989 81 6 445 44 melanoma antigen gp75 Vijayasardahl et al. 1990 171 4 1375 1380 high molecular weight melanoma antigen HMW MAA Natali et al. 1987 59 55 3 Mittelman et al. 1990 86 2136 2144 prostate specific membrane antigen carcinoembryonic antigen CEA Foon et al. 1994 13 294 polymorphic epithelial mucin antigen human milk fat globule antigen Colorectal tumor associated antigens such as CEA TAG 72 Yokata et al. 1992 52 3402 3408 CO17 1A Ragnhammar et al. 1993 53 751 758 GICA 19 9 Herlyn et al. 1982 2 135 CTA 1 and LEA Burkitt s lymphoma antigen 38.13 CD19 Ghetie et al. 1994 83 1329 1336 human B lymphoma antigen CD20 Reff et al. 1994 83 435 445 CD33 Sgouros et al. 1993 34 422 430 melanoma specific antigens such as ganglioside GD2 Saleh et al. 1993 J.

In a specific embodiment a molecule of the invention e.g. an antibody comprising a variant Fc region or a therapeutic monoclonal antibody engineered according to the methods of the invention kills cells or inhibits or reduces the growth of cancer cells at least 5 at least 10 at least 20 at least 25 at least 30 at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 100 better than the parent molecule.

The invention further encompasses administering the molecules of the invention in combination with other therapies known to those skilled in the art for the treatment or prevention of cancer or infectious disease including but not limited to current standard and experimental chemotherapies hormonal therapies biological therapies immunotherapies radiation therapies or surgery. In some embodiments the molecules of the invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of one or more anti cancer agents therapeutic antibodies e.g. antibodies listed in Table 9 or other agents known to those skilled in the art for the treatment and or prevention of cancer See Section 5.4.1.2 .

In certain embodiments one or more molecule of the invention is administered to a mammal preferably a human concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer. The term concurrently is not limited to the administration of prophylactic or therapeutic agents at exactly the same time but rather it is meant that a molecule of the invention and the other agent are administered to a mammal in a sequence and within a time interval such that the molecule of the invention can act together with the other agent to provide an increased benefit than if they were administered otherwise. For example each prophylactic or therapeutic agent e.g. chemotherapy radiation therapy hormonal therapy or biological therapy may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time however if not administered at the same time they should be administered sufficiently close in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect. Each therapeutic agent can be administered separately in any appropriate form and by any suitable route. In various embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered less than 1 hour apart at about 1 hour apart at about 1 hour to about 2 hours apart at about 2 hours to about 3 hours apart at about 3 hours to about 4 hours apart at about 4 hours to about 5 hours apart at about 5 hours to about 6 hours apart at about 6 hours to about 7 hours apart at about 7 hours to about 8 hours apart at about 8 hours to about 9 hours apart at about 9 hours to about 10 hours apart at about 10 hours to about 11 hours apart at about 11 hours to about 12 hours apart no more than 24 hours apart or no more than 48 hours apart. In preferred embodiments two or more components are administered within the same patient visit.

In other embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered at about 2 to 4 days apart at about 4 to 6 days apart at about 1 week part at about 1 to 2 weeks apart or more than 2 weeks apart. In preferred embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a time frame where both agents are still active. One skilled in the art would be able to determine such a time frame by determining the half life of the administered agents.

In certain embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are cyclically administered to a subject. Cycling therapy involves the administration of a first agent for a period of time followed by the administration of a second agent and or third agent for a period of time and repeating this sequential administration. Cycling therapy can reduce the development of resistance to one or more of the therapies avoid or reduce the side effects of one of the therapies and or improves the efficacy of the treatment.

In certain embodiments prophylactic or therapeutic agents are administered in a cycle of less than about 3 weeks about once every two weeks about once every 10 days or about once every week. One cycle can comprise the administration of a therapeutic or prophylactic agent by infusion over about 90 minutes every cycle about 1 hour every cycle about 45 minutes every cycle. Each cycle can comprise at least 1 week of rest at least 2 weeks of rest at least 3 weeks of rest. The number of cycles administered is from about 1 to about 12 cycles more typically from about 2 to about 10 cycles and more typically from about 2 to about 8 cycles.

In yet other embodiments the therapeutic and prophylactic agents of the invention are administered in metronomic dosing regimens either by continuous infusion or frequent administration without extended rest periods. Such metronomic administration can involve dosing at constant intervals without rest periods. Typically the therapeutic agents in particular cytotoxic agents are used at lower doses. Such dosing regimens encompass the chronic daily administration of relatively low doses for extended periods of time. In preferred embodiments the use of lower doses can minimize toxic side effects and eliminate rest periods. In certain embodiments the therapeutic and prophylactic agents are delivered by chronic low dose or continuous infusion ranging from about 24 hours to about 2 days to about 1 week to about 2 weeks to about 3 weeks to about 1 month to about 2 months to about 3 months to about 4 months to about 5 months to about 6 months. The scheduling of such dose regimens can be optimized by the skilled oncologist.

In other embodiments courses of treatment are administered concurrently to a mammal i.e. individual doses of the therapeutics are administered separately yet within a time interval such that molecules of the invention can work together with the other agent or agents. For example one component may be administered one time per week in combination with the other components that may be administered one time every two weeks or one time every three weeks. In other words the dosing regimens for the therapeutics are carried out concurrently even if the therapeutics are not administered simultaneously or within the same patient visit.

When used in combination with other prophylactic and or therapeutic agents the molecules of the invention and the prophylactic and or therapeutic agent can act additively or more preferably synergistically. In one embodiment a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more therapeutic agents in the same pharmaceutical composition. In another embodiment a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with one or more other therapeutic agents in separate pharmaceutical compositions. In still another embodiment a molecule of the invention is administered prior to or subsequent to administration of another prophylactic or therapeutic agent. The invention contemplates administration of a molecule of the invention in combination with other prophylactic or therapeutic agents by the same or different routes of administration e.g. oral and parenteral. In certain embodiments when a molecule of the invention is administered concurrently with another prophylactic or therapeutic agent that potentially produces adverse side effects including but not limited to toxicity the prophylactic or therapeutic agent can advantageously be administered at a dose that falls below the threshold that the adverse side effect is elicited.

The dosage amounts and frequencies of administration provided herein are encompassed by the terms therapeutically effective and prophylactically effective. The dosage and frequency further will typically vary according to factors specific for each patient depending on the specific therapeutic or prophylactic agents administered the severity and type of cancer the route of administration as well as age body weight response and the past medical history of the patient. Suitable regimens can be selected by one skilled in the art by considering such factors and by following for example dosages reported in the literature and recommended in the 56ed. 2002 .

In some embodiments molecules of the invention comprise a variant Fc region having one or more amino acid modifications in one or more regions which modification increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIB but decreases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA. Molecules of the invention with such binding characteristics are useful in regulating the immune response e.g. in inhibiting the immune response in connection with autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases. Although not intending to be bound by any mechanism of action molecules of the invention with an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIB and a decreased affinity for Fc RIIIA and or Fc RIIA may lead to dampening of the activating response to Fc R and inhibition of cellular responsiveness.

In some embodiments a molecule of the invention comprising a variant Fc region is not an immunoglobulin and comprises at least one amino acid modification which modification increases the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIB relative to a molecule comprising a wild type Fc region. In other embodiments said molecule further comprises one or more amino acid modifications which modifications decreases the affinity of the molecule for an activating Fc R. In some embodiments the molecule is a soluble i.e. not membrane bound Fc region. The invention contemplates other amino acid modifications within the soluble Fc region which modulate its affinity for various Fc receptors including those known to one skilled in the art as described herein. In other embodiments the molecule e.g. the Fc region comprising at least one or more amino acid modification is modified using techniques known to one skilled in the art and as described herein to increase the in vivo half life of the Fc region. Such molecules have therapeutic utility in treating and or preventing an autoimmune disorder. Although not intending to be bound by any mechanism of actions such molecules with enhanced affinity for Fc RIIB will lead to a dampening of the activating receptors and thus a dampening of the immune response and have therapeutic efficacy for treating and or preventing an autoimmune disorder.

In certain embodiments the one or more amino acid modifications which increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIB but decrease the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 246 with threonine and at position 396 with histidine or a substitution at position 268 with aspartic acid and at position 318 with aspartic acid or a substitution at position 217 with serine at position 378 with valine and at position 408 with arginine or a substitution at position 375 with cysteine and at position 396 with leucine or a substitution at position 246 with isoleucine and at position 334 with asparagine. In one embodiment the one or more amino acid modifications which increase the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIB but decrease the affinity of the variant Fc region for Fc RIIIA comprise a substitution at position 247 with leucine.

The invention further encompasses using a composition of the invention to induce an immune response against an antigenic or immunogenic agent including but not limited to cancer antigens and infectious disease antigens examples of which are disclosed infra . The vaccine compositions of the invention comprise one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents to which an immune response is desired wherein the one or more antigenic or immunogenic agents is coated with a variant antibody of the invention that has a conferred effector function and or an enhanced affinity to Fc RIIIA. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action coating an antigenic or immunogenic agent with a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity to Fc RIIIA enhances the immune response to the desired antigenic or immunogenic agent by inducing humoral and cell mediated responses. The vaccine compositions of the invention are particularly effective in eliciting an immune response preferably a protective immune response against the antigenic or immunogenic agent.

In some embodiments the antigenic or immunogenic agent in the vaccine compositions of the invention comprise a virus against which an immune response is desired. The viruses may be recombinant or chimeric and are preferably attenuated. Production of recombinant chimeric and attenuated viruses may be performed using standard methods known to one skilled in the art. The invention encompasses a live recombinant viral vaccine or an inactivated recombinant viral vaccine to be formulated in accordance with the invention. A live vaccine may be preferred because multiplication in the host leads to a prolonged stimulus of similar kind and magnitude to that occurring in natural infections and therefore confers substantial long lasting immunity. Production of such live recombinant virus vaccine formulations may be accomplished using conventional methods involving propagation of the virus in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo followed by purification.

In a specific embodiment the recombinant virus is non pathogenic to the subject to which it is administered. In this regard the use of genetically engineered viruses for vaccine purposes may require the presence of attenuation characteristics in these strains. The introduction of appropriate mutations e.g. deletions into the templates used for transfection may provide the novel viruses with attenuation characteristics. For example specific missense mutations which are associated with temperature sensitivity or cold adaption can be made into deletion mutations. These mutations should be more stable than the point mutations associated with cold or temperature sensitive mutants and reversion frequencies should be extremely low. Recombinant DNA technologies for engineering recombinant viruses are known in the art and encompassed in the invention. For example techniques for modifying negative strand RNA viruses are known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 166 057 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Alternatively chimeric viruses with suicide characteristics may be constructed for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. Such viruses would go through only one or a few rounds of replication within the host. When used as a vaccine the recombinant virus would go through limited replication cycle s and induce a sufficient level of immune response but it would not go further in the human host and cause disease. Alternatively inactivated killed virus may be formulated in accordance with the invention. Inactivated vaccine formulations may be prepared using conventional techniques to kill the chimeric viruses. Inactivated vaccines are dead in the sense that their infectivity has been destroyed. Ideally the infectivity of the virus is destroyed without affecting its immunogenicity. In order to prepare inactivated vaccines the chimeric virus may be grown in cell culture or in the allantois of the chick embryo purified by zonal ultracentrifugation inactivated by formaldehyde or propiolactone and pooled.

In certain embodiments completely foreign epitopes including antigens derived from other viral or non viral pathogens can be engineered into the virus for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations of the invention. For example antigens of non related viruses such as HIV gp160 gp120 gp41 parasite antigens e.g. malaria bacterial or fungal antigens or tumor antigens can be engineered into the attenuated strain.

Virtually any heterologous gene sequence may be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention for use in the intradermal vaccine formulations. Preferably heterologous gene sequences are moieties and peptides that act as biological response modifiers. Preferably epitopes that induce a protective immune response to any of a variety of pathogens or antigens that bind neutralizing antibodies may be expressed by or as part of the chimeric viruses. For example heterologous gene sequences that can be constructed into the chimeric viruses of the invention include but are not limited to influenza and parainfluenza hemagglutinin neuraminidase and fusion glycoproteins such as the HN and F genes of human PIV3. In yet another embodiment heterologous gene sequences that can be engineered into the chimeric viruses include those that encode proteins with immuno modulating activities. Examples of immuno modulating proteins include but are not limited to cytokines interferon type 1 gamma interferon colony stimulating factors interleukin 1 2 4 5 6 12 and antagonists of these agents.

In yet other embodiments the invention encompasses pathogenic cells or viruses preferably attenuated viruses which express the variant antibody on their surface.

In alternative embodiments the vaccine compositions of the invention comprise a fusion polypeptide wherein an antigenic or immunogenic agent is operatively linked to a variant antibody of the invention that has an enhanced affinity for Fc RIIIA. Engineering fusion polypeptides for use in the vaccine compositions of the invention is performed using routine recombinant DNA technology methods and is within the level of ordinary skill.

The invention further encompasses methods to induce tolerance in a subject by administering a composition of the invention. Preferably a composition suitable for inducing tolerance in a subject comprises an antigenic or immunogenic agent coated with a variant antibody of the invention wherein the variant antibody has a higher affinity to Fc RIIB. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action such compositions are effective in inducing tolerance by activating the Fc RIIB mediated inhibitory pathway.

The invention provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions comprising molecules of the invention i.e. antibodies polypeptides comprising variant Fc regions. The invention also provides methods of treatment prophylaxis and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease disorder or infection by administering to a subject an effective amount of a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a fusion protein or a conjugated molecule of the invention.

The compositions may be administered by any convenient route for example by infusion or bolus injection by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings e.g. oral mucosa rectal and intestinal mucosa etc. and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local. In addition pulmonary administration can also be employed e.g. by use of an inhaler or nebulizer and formulation with an aerosolizing agent. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 019 968 5 985 320 5 985 309 5 934 272 5 874 064 5 855 913 5 290 540 and 4 880 078 and PCT Publication Nos. WO 92 19244 WO 97 32572 WO 97 44013 WO 98 31346 and WO 99 66903 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention also provides that the molecules of the invention i.e. antibodies polypeptides comprising variant Fc regions are packaged in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of antibody. In one embodiment the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterilized lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container and can be reconstituted e.g. with water or saline to the appropriate concentration for administration to a subject. Preferably the molecules of the invention are supplied as a dry sterile lyophilized powder in a hermetically sealed container at a unit dosage of at least 5 mg more preferably at least 10 mg at least 15 mg at least 25 mg at least 35 mg at least 45 mg at least 50 mg or at least 75 mg. The lyophilized molecules of the invention should be stored at between 2 and 8 C. in their original container and the molecules should be administered within 12 hours preferably within 6 hours within 5 hours within 3 hours or within 1 hour after being reconstituted. In an alternative embodiment molecules of the invention are supplied in liquid form in a hermetically sealed container indicating the quantity and concentration of the molecule fusion protein or conjugated molecule. Preferably the liquid form of the molecules of the invention are supplied in a hermetically sealed container at least 1 mg ml more preferably at least 2.5 mg ml at least 5 mg ml at least 8 mg ml at least 10 mg ml at least 15 mg kg at least 25 mg ml at least 50 mg ml at least 100 mg ml at least 150 mg ml at least 200 mg ml of the molecules.

The amount of the composition of the invention which will be effective in the treatment prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disorder can be determined by standard clinical techniques. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the condition and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

For antibodies encompassed by the invention the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.0001 mg kg to 100 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Preferably the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.0001 mg kg and 20 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 10 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 5 mg kg 0.0001 and 2 mg kg 0.0001 and 1 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 0.75 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg and 0.5 mg kg 0.0001 mg kg to 0.25 mg kg 0.0001 to 0.15 mg kg 0.0001 to 0.10 mg kg 0.001 to 0.5 mg kg 0.01 to 0.25 mg kg or 0.01 to 0.10 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Generally human antibodies have a longer half life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention or fragments thereof may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration of the antibodies by modifications such as for example lipidation.

In one embodiment the dosage of the molecules of the invention administered to a patient are 0.01 mg to 1000 mg day when used as single agent therapy. In another embodiment the molecules of the invention are used in combination with other therapeutic compositions and the dosage administered to a patient are lower than when said molecules are used as a single agent therapy.

In a specific embodiment it may be desirable to administer the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention locally to the area in need of treatment this may be achieved by for example and not by way of limitation local infusion by injection or by means of an implant said implant being of a porous non porous or gelatinous material including membranes such as sialastic membranes or fibers. Preferably when administering a molecule of the invention care must be taken to use materials to which the molecule does not absorb.

In another embodiment the compositions can be delivered in a vesicle in particular a liposome See Langer 249 1527 1533 1990 Treat et al. in Lopez Berestein and Fidler eds. Liss N.Y. pp. 353 365 1989 Lopez Berestein ibid. pp. 3 17 327 see generally ibid. .

In yet another embodiment the compositions can be delivered in a controlled release or sustained release system. Any technique known to one of skill in the art can be used to produce sustained release formulations comprising one or more molecules of the invention. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4 526 938 PCT publication WO 91 05548 PCT publication WO 96 20698 Ning et al. 1996 Intratumoral Radioimmunotheraphy of a Human Colon Cancer Xenograft Using a Sustained Release Gel 39 179 189 Song et al. 1995 Antibody Mediated Lung Targeting of Long Circulating Emulsions 50 372 397 Cleek et al. 1997 Biodegradable Polymeric Carriers for a bFGF Antibody for Cardiovascular Application 24 853 854 and Lam et al. 1997 Microencapsulation of Recombinant Humanized Monoclonal Antibody for Local Delivery 24 759 760 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment a pump may be used in a controlled release system See Langer supra Sefton 1987 14 20 Buchwald et al. 1980 Surgery 88 507 and Saudek et al. 1989 321 574 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used to achieve controlled release of antibodies see e.g. Langer and Wise eds. CRC Pres. Boca Raton Fla. 1974 Controlled Drug Bioavailability Drug Product Design and Performance Smolen and Ball eds. Wiley N.Y. 1984 Ranger and Peppas 1983 J. 23 61 See also Levy et al. 1985 228 190 During et al. 1989 Ann. Neurol. 25 351 Howard et al. 1989 7 1 105 U.S. Pat. No. 5 679 377 U.S. Pat. No. 5 916 597 U.S. Pat. No. 5 912 015 U.S. Pat. No. 5 989 463 U.S. Pat. No. 5 128 326 PCT Publication No. WO 99 15154 and PCT Publication No. WO 99 20253 .

In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target e.g. the lungs thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 . In another embodiment polymeric compositions useful as controlled release implants are used according to Dunn et al. See U.S. Pat. No. 5 945 155 . This particular method is based upon the therapeutic effect of the in situ controlled release of the bioactive material from the polymer system. The implantation can generally occur anywhere within the body of the patient in need of therapeutic treatment. In another embodiment a non polymeric sustained delivery system is used whereby a non polymeric implant in the body of the subject is used as a drug delivery system. Upon implantation in the body the organic solvent of the implant will dissipate disperse or leach from the composition into surrounding tissue fluid and the non polymeric material will gradually coagulate or precipitate to form a solid microporous matrix See U.S. Pat. No. 5 888 533 .

In a specific embodiment the term pharmaceutically acceptable means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals and more particularly in humans. The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant e.g. Freund s adjuvant complete and incomplete excipient or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents.

In a specific embodiment nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding molecules of the invention are administered to treat prevent or ameliorate one or more symptoms associated with a disease disorder or infection by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention the nucleic acids produce their encoded antibody or fusion protein that mediates a therapeutic or prophylactic effect.

Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.

For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy see Goldspiel et al. 1993 12 488 505 Wu and Wu 1991 3 87 95 Tolstoshev 1993 32 573 596 Mulligan Science 260 926 932 1993 and Morgan and Anderson 1993 62 191 217 May 1993 11 5 155 215. Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. eds. John Wiley Sons NY 1993 and Kriegler Stockton Press NY 1990 .

In a preferred aspect a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding an antibody said nucleic acids being part of an expression vector that expresses the antibody in a suitable host. In particular such nucleic acids have promoters preferably heterologous promoters operably linked to the antibody coding region said promoter being inducible or constitutive and optionally tissue specific. In another particular embodiment nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids Koller and Smithies 1989 86 8932 8935 and Zijlstra et al. 1989 342 435 438 .

In another preferred aspect a composition of the invention comprises nucleic acids encoding a fusion protein said nucleic acids being a part of an expression vector that expresses the fusion protein in a suitable host. In particular such nucleic acids have promoters preferably heterologous promoters operably linked to the coding region of a fusion protein said promoter being inducible or constitutive and optionally tissue specific. In another particular embodiment nucleic acid molecules are used in which the coding sequence of the fusion protein and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the fusion protein.

Delivery of the nucleic acids into a subject may be either direct in which case the subject is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid carrying vectors or indirect in which case cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro then transplanted into the subject. These two approaches are known respectively as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art e.g. by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular e.g. by infection using defective or attenuated retroviral or other viral vectors see U.S. Pat. No. 4 980 286 or by direct injection of naked DNA or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun Biolistic Dupont or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents encapsulation in liposomes microparticles or microcapsules or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor mediated endocytosis See e.g. Wu and Wu 1987 262 4429 4432 which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors etc. In another embodiment nucleic acid ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression by targeting a specific receptor See e.g. PCT Publications WO 92 06180 WO 92 22635 W092 20316 WO93 14188 WO 93 20221 . Alternatively the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination Koller and Smithies 1989 86 8932 8935 and Zijlstra et al. 1989 342 435 438 .

In a specific embodiment viral vectors that contain nucleic acid sequences encoding a molecule of the invention e.g. an antibody or a fusion protein are used. For example a retroviral vector can be used See Miller et al. 1993 217 581 599 . These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody or a fusion protein to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors which facilitates delivery of the nucleotide sequence into a subject. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al. 1994 6 291 302 which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr 1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are Clowes et al. 1994 93 644 651 Klein et al. 1994 83 1467 1473 Salmons and Gunzberg 1993 4 129 141 and Grossman and Wilson 1993 3 110 114.

Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus based delivery systems are liver the central nervous system endothelial cells and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson 3 499 503 1993 present a review of adenovirus based gene therapy. Bout et al. 5 3 10 1994 demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al. 1991 252 431 434 Rosenfeld et al. 1992 68 143 155 Mastrangeli et al. 1993 91 225 234 PCT Publication W094 12649 and Wang et al. 1995 2 775 783. In a preferred embodiment adenovirus vectors are used.

Adeno associated virus AAV has also been proposed for use in gene therapy see e.g. Walsh et al. 1993 204 289 300 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 436 146 .

Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation lipofection calcium phosphate mediated transfection or viral infection. Usually the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a subject.

In this embodiment the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art including but not limited to transfection electroporation microinjection infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcellmediated gene transfer spheroplast fusion etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells See e.g. Loeffler and Behr 1993 217 599 618 Cohen et al. 1993 217 618 644 and 29 69 92 1985 and may be used in accordance with the present invention provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.

The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a subject by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells e.g. hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect patient state etc. and can be determined by one skilled in the art.

Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired available cell type and include but are not limited to epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts muscle cells hepatocytes blood cells such as T lymphocytes B lymphocytes monocytes macrophages neutrophils eosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes various stem or progenitor cells in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells e.g. as obtained from bone marrow umbilical cord blood peripheral blood fetal liver etc.

In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody or a fusion protein are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention See e.g. PCT Publication WO 94 08598 Stemple and Anderson 1992 7 1 973 985 Rheinwald 1980 21A 229 and Pittelkow and Scott 1986 61 771 .

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy comprises an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.

The invention provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with the molecules of the invention i.e. antibodies polypeptides comprising variant Fc regions . Additionally one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of a disease can also be included in the pharmaceutical pack or kit. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container s can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture use or sale for human administration.

The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment a kit comprises one or more molecules of the invention. In another embodiment a kit further comprises one or more other prophylactic or therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cancer or infectious disease in one or more containers. In another embodiment a kit further comprises one or more cytotoxic antibodies that bind one or more antigens associated with cancer or infectious disease. In certain embodiments the other prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a chemotherapeutic. In other embodiments the prophylactic or therapeutic agent is a biological or hormonal therapeutic.

Several aspects of the pharmaceutical compositions prophylactic or therapeutic agents of the invention are preferably tested in vitro in a cell culture system and in an animal model organism such as a rodent animal model system for the desired therapeutic activity prior to use in humans. For example assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific pharmaceutical composition is desired include cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture and exposed to or otherwise contacted with a pharmaceutical composition of the invention and the effect of such composition upon the tissue sample is observed. The tissue sample can be obtained by biopsy from the patient. This test allows the identification of the therapeutically most effective prophylactic or therapeutic molecule s for each individual patient. In various specific embodiments in vitro assays can be carried out with representative cells of cell types involved in an autoimmune or inflammatory disorder e.g. T cells to determine if a pharmaceutical composition of the invention has a desired effect upon such cell types.

Combinations of prophylactic and or therapeutic agents can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to use in humans. Such animal model systems include but are not limited to rats mice chicken cows monkeys pigs dogs rabbits etc. Any animal system well known in the art may be used. In a specific embodiment of the invention combinations of prophylactic and or therapeutic agents are tested in a mouse model system. Such model systems are widely used and well known to the skilled artisan. Prophylactic and or therapeutic agents can be administered repeatedly. Several aspects of the procedure may vary. Said aspects include the temporal regime of administering the prophylactic and or therapeutic agents and whether such agents are administered separately or as an admixture.

Preferred animal models for use in the methods of the invention are for example transgenic mice expressing human Fc Rs on mouse effector cells e.g. any mouse model described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 396 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety can be used in the present invention. Transgenic mice for use in the methods of the invention include but are not limited to mice carrying human Fc RIIIA mice carrying human Fc RIIA mice carrying human Fc RIIB and human Fc RIIIA mice carrying human Fc RIIB and human Fc RIIA.

Preferably mutations showing the highest levels of activity in the functional assays described above will be tested for use in animal model studies prior to use in humans. Sufficient quantities of antibodies may be prepared for use in animal models using methods described supra for example using mammalian expression systems and IgG purification methods disclosed and exemplified herein.

Mouse xenograft models may be used for examining efficacy of mouse antibodies generated against a tumor specific target based on the affinity and specificity of the CDR regions of the antibody molecule and the ability of the Fc region of the antibody to elicit an immune response Wu et al. 2001 Trends Cell Biol. 11 S2 9 . Transgenic mice expressing human Fc Rs on mouse effector cells are unique and are tailor made animal models to test the efficacy of human Fc Fc R interactions. Pairs of Fc RIIIA Fc RIIIB and Fc RIIA transgenic mouse lines generated in the lab of Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch Through a licensing agreement with Rockefeller U. and Sloan Kettering Cancer center can be used such as those listed in the Table 11 below.

Preferably Fc mutants showing both enhanced binding to Fc RIIIA and reduced binding to Fc RIIB increased activity in ADCC and phagocytosis assays are tested in animal model experiments. The animal model experiments examine the increase in efficacy of Fc mutant bearing antibodies in Fc RIIIA transgenic nude mCD16A knockout mice compared to a control which has been administered native antibody. Preferably groups of 8 10 mice are examined using a standard protocol. An exemplary animal model experiment may comprise the following steps in a breast cancer model 2 10SK BR 3 cells are injected subcutaneously on day 1 with 0.1 mL PBS mixed with Matrigel Becton Dickinson . Initially a wild type chimeric antibody and isotype control are administered to establish a curve for the predetermined therapeutic dose intravenous injection of 4D5 on day 1 with an initial dose of 4 g g followed by weekly injections of 2 g g. Tumor volume is monitored for 6 8 weeks to measure progress of the disease. Tumor volume should increase linearly with time in animals injected with the isotype control. In contrast very little tumor growth should occur in the group injected with 4D5. Results from the standard dose study are used to set an upper limit for experiments testing the Fc mutants. These studies are done using subtherapeutic doses of the Fc mutant containing antibodies. A one tenth dose was used on xenograft models in experiments done in Fc RIIB knockout mice see Clynes et al. 2000 6 443 6 with a resultant block in tumor cell growth. Since the mutants of the invention preferrably show an increase in Fc RIIIA activation and reduction in Fc RIIB binding the mutants are examined at one tenth therapeutic dose. Examination of tumor size at different intervals indicates the efficacy of the antibodies at the lower dose. Statistical analysis of the data using t test provides a way of determining if the data is significant. Fc mutants that show increased efficacy are tested at incrementally lower doses to determine the smallest possible dose as a measure of their efficacy.

The anti inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be determined by using various experimental animal models of inflammatory arthritis known in the art and described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L. Arthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals in Arthritis and Allied Conditions A Textbook of Rheumatology McCarty et al. eds. Chapter 30 Lee and Febiger 1993 . Experimental and spontaneous animal models of inflammatory arthritis and autoimmune rheumatic diseases can also be used to assess the anti inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention. The following are some assays provided as examples and not by limitation.

The principle animal models for arthritis or inflammatory disease known in the art and widely used include adjuvant induced arthritis rat models collagen induced arthritis rat and mouse models and antigen induced arthritis rat rabbit and hamster models all described in Crofford L. J. and Wilder R. L. Arthritis and Autoimmunity in Animals in Arthritis and Allied Conditions A Textbook of Rheumatology McCarty et al. eds. Chapter 30 Lee and Febiger 1993 incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The anti inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can be assessed using a carrageenan induced arthritis rat model. Carrageenan induced arthritis has also been used in rabbit dog and pig in studies of chronic arthritis or inflammation. Quantitative histomorphometric assessment is used to determine therapeutic efficacy. The methods for using such a carrageenan induced arthritis model is described in Hansra P. et al. Carrageenan Induced Arthritis in the Rat 24 2 141 155 2000 . Also commonly used are zymosan induced inflammation animal models as known and described in the art.

The anti inflammatory activity of the combination therapies of invention can also be assessed by measuring the inhibition of carrageenan induced paw edema in the rat using a modification of the method described in Winter C. A. et al. Carrageenan Induced Edema in Hind Paw of the Rat as an Assay for Anti inflammatory Drugs 111 544 547 1962 . This assay has been used as a primary in vivo screen for the anti inflammatory activity of most NSAIDs and is considered predictive of human efficacy. The anti inflammatory activity of the test prophylactic or therapeutic agents is expressed as the percent inhibition of the increase in hind paw weight of the test group relative to the vehicle dosed control group.

Animal models for autoimmune disorders can also be used to assess the efficacy of the combination therapies of invention. Animal models for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes thyroid autoimmunity systemic lupus eruthematosus and glomerulonephritis have been developed Flanders et al. 1999 29 235 246 Krogh et al. 1999 81 511 515 Foster 1999 19 12 24 .

Further any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for autoimmune and or inflammatory diseases.

Toxicity and efficacy of the prophylactic and or therapeutic protocols of the instant invention can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals e.g. for determining the LD the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the ED the dose therapeutically effective in 50 of the population . The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD ED. Prophylactic and or therapeutic agents that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. While prophylactic and or therapeutic agents that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such agents to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to uninfected cells and thereby reduce side effects.

The data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage of the prophylactic and or therapeutic agents for use in humans. The dosage of such agents lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the EDwith little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. For any agent used in the method of the invention the therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. A dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC i.e. the concentration of the test compound that achieves a half maximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture. Such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans. Levels in plasma may be measured for example by high performance liquid chromatography.

The anti cancer activity of the therapies used in accordance with the present invention also can be determined by using various experimental animal models for the study of cancer such as the SCID mouse model or transgenic mice or nude mice with human xenografts animal models such as hamsters rabbits etc. known in the art and described in 1999 eds. Fiebig and Burger 1999 Karger 1991 eds. Boven and Winograd and 1997 ed. Teicher herein incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Preferred animal models for determining the therapeutic efficacy of the molecules of the invention are mouse xenograft models. Tumor cell lines that can be used as a source for xenograft tumors include but are not limited to SKBR3 and MCF7 cells which can be derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These cells have both erbB2 and prolactin receptors. SKBR3 cells have been used routinely in the art as ADCC and xenograft tumor models. Alternatively OVCAR3 cells derived from a human ovarian adenocarcinoma can be used as a source for xenograft tumors.

The protocols and compositions of the invention are preferably tested in vitro and then in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity prior to use in humans. Therapeutic agents and methods may be screened using cells of a tumor or malignant cell line. Many assays standard in the art can be used to assess such survival and or growth for example cell proliferation can be assayed by measuring H thymidine incorporation by direct cell count by detecting changes in transcriptional activity of known genes such as proto oncogenes e.g. fos myc or cell cycle markers cell viability can be assessed by trypan blue staining differentiation can be assessed visually based on changes in morphology decreased growth and or colony formation in soft agar or tubular network formation in three dimensional basement membrane or extracellular matrix preparation etc.

Compounds for use in therapy can be tested in suitable animal model systems prior to testing in humans including but not limited to in rats mice chicken cows monkeys rabbits hamsters etc. for example the animal models described above. The compounds can then be used in the appropriate clinical trials.

Further any assays known to those skilled in the art can be used to evaluate the prophylactic and or therapeutic utility of the combinatorial therapies disclosed herein for treatment or prevention of cancer inflammatory disorder or autoimmune disease.

The invention encompasses molecules e.g. antibodies with altered affinities and avidities for one or more Fc Rs. The antibodies of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for one or more Fc Rs are particularly useful in cellular systems for example for research or diagnostic purposes where the Fc Rs are expressed at low levels. Although not intending to be bound by a particular mechanism of action the molecules of the invention with enhanced affinity and avidity for a particular Fc R are valuable as research and diagnostic tools by enhancing the sensitivity of detection of Fc Rs which are normally undetectable due to a low level of expression.

Using a yeast display system mutant human IgG1 heavy chain Fc regions were screened for modified affinity to different Fc receptors. In particular a mutant Fc library was generated by error prone PCR Genemorph Stratagene and then the mutant Fc proteins were fused to the Aga2p cell wall protein which allowed the fusion protein to be secreted extracellularly and displayed on the yeast cell wall.

Soluble forms of the human receptors Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB were cloned. Detection of the IgG1 Fc domains on the yeast cell surface however is hindered due to the low affinity of Fc R for its ligand. In order to circumvent this limitation soluble Fc R tetrameric complexes were formed using an AVITAG sequence which could be enzymatically biotinylated and subsequently reacted with streptavidin conjugated to phycoerythrin SA PE Molecular Probes to form soluble tetrameric Fc R complexes. ELISA assays confirmed that the soluble Fc R tetrameric complexes had a higher avidity for human IgG1 relative to the monomeric Fc R. Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface also bound the soluble Fc R tetrameric complexes as assessed by FACS analysis.

The differential binding of the Fc fusion proteins expressed on the yeast cell surface to soluble tetrameric Fc R complexes was monitored by a FACS analysis. Fc fusion proteins with altered affinities for one or more soluble tetrameric Fc R complexes were thus identified and were then incorporated into a complete immunoglobulin and expressed in mammalian cells. The mammalian expressed product was used in ELISA assays to confirm the results obtained in the yeast surface display system. Finally the mutant Fc regions were sequenced to confirm the altered residue s .

Soluble Fc RIIB and Fc RIIIA were cloned as follows. The cDNA clones for the human Fc R genes Fc RIIB and Fc RIIIA were obtained gift from Ravetch lab . Soluble region of the Fc RIIIA gene amino acids 7 203 was amplified by PCR Table 12 digested with BamHI HindIII and ligated into the pET25vector Novagen . This vector was digested with Sall Notl and a 370 by fragment was gel isolated. The vector hu3A gift from J. Ravetch was digested with BamHI Sall and a 270 by fragment containing the N terminus of Fc RIIIA was isolated. Both fragments were coligated into pcDNA3.1 cut with BamH NotI to create pcDNA3 Fc RIIIA amino acids 1 203 . The soluble region of Fc RIIB amino acids 33 180 was amplified by PCR Table 12 digested with BglII HindIII and ligated into pET25b Novagen . This vector was digested with BamHI NotI and a 140 bp fragment was gel isolated. The vector huRIIb1 gift from J. Ravetch was digested with BamHI EcoRI and a 440 bp N terminal Fc RIIB fragment was isolated. Both of these fragments were coligated into pcDNA3.1 cut with BamHI Notl to create pcDNA3 Fc RIIB amino acids 1 180 . Recombinant clones were transfected into 293H cells supernatants were collected from cell cultures and soluble recombinant Fc R rFc R proteins were purified on an IgG sepharose column.

Recombinant Soluble Fc RIIIA rFc RIIIA and Recombinant Soluble Fc RIIB rFc RIIB were Purified to Homogeneity

Subsequent to expression and purification of the recombinant soluble Fc R proteins on an IgG sepharose column the purity and apparent molecular weight of the recombinant purified soluble receptor proteins were determined by SDS PAGE. As shown in soluble rFc RIIIA lane 1 had the expected apparent molecular weight of 35 KDa and soluble rFc RIIB lane 4 had the expected apparent molecular weight of 20 KDa. As shown in soluble rFc RIIIA migrates as a diffuse fuzzy band which has been attributed to the high degree of glycosylation normally found on Fc RIIIA Jefferis et al. 1995 44 111 117 .

Purified soluble rFc RIIIA which was obtained as described above was analyzed for direct binding against human monomeric or aggregated IgG using an ELISA assay. The plate is coated with 10 ng of soluble rFc RIIIA overnight in 1 PBS. Subsequent to coating the plate is washed three times in 1 PBS 0.1 Tween 20. Human IgG either biotinylated monomeric IgG or biotinylated aggregated IgG is added to the wells at a concentration ranging from 0.03 mg mL to 2 mg mL and allowed to bind to the soluble rFc RIIIA. The reaction is carried out for one hour at 37 C. The plate is washed again three times with 1 PBS 0.1 Tween 20. The binding of human IgG to soluble rFc RIIIA is detected with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate by monitoring the absorbance at 650 nm. The absorbance at 650 nm is proportional to the bound aggregated IgG.

In a blocking ELISA experiment the ability of an Fc RIIIA monoclonal antibody 3G8 a mouse anti Fc RIIIA antibody Pharmingen to block the binding of the receptor to aggregated IgG is monitored. The washing and incubation conditions were the same as described above except that prior to IgG addition a 5 fold molar excess of 3G8 was added and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 37 C.

The direct binding of purified recombinant soluble Fc RIIIA to aggregated and monomeric IgG was tested using an ELISA assay . At an IgG concentration of 2 g ml strong binding to the aggregated IgG was observed. However at a similar concentration no binding was detected to the monomeric IgG. The binding to aggregated IgG was blocked by 3G8 a mouse anti Fc RIIIA monoclonal antibody that blocks the ligand binding site indicating that the aggregated IgG binding is via that of the normal Fc RIIIA ligand binding site . Soluble rFc RIIB was also characterized and shown to bind to IgG with similar characteristics as the soluble rFc RIIIA data not shown .

To generate soluble Fc R tetrameric complexes the soluble region of the human FcR IIIA gene amino acids 7 203 was amplified by PCR Table 12 digested with BamHI HindIII and ligated into the pET25b Novagen . This vector was digested with SalI Not1 and a 370 bp fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The vector hu3A gift from J. Ravetch was digested with BamHI SalI and a 270 bp fragment containing the N terminus of FcR IIIA was isolated. Both fragments were coligated into pcDNA3.1 Invitrogen which had been digested with BamH NotI to create pcDNA3 FcRgIIIA amino acids 1 203 .

The soluble region of FcR IIB amino acids 33 180 was amplified by PCR Table I digested with BglII HindIII and ligated into pET25b Novagen . This vector was digested with BamHI NotI and a 140 bp fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The vector huRIIb gift from J. Ravetch was digested with BamHI EcoRI and a 440 by FcR IIB N terminal fragment was isolated. Both of these fragments were co ligated into pcDNA3.1 which had been digested with BamHI Notl to create pcDNA3 FcR IIB amino acids 1 180 . Subsequently the linker AVITAG peptide sequence was fused to the C terminus of both Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB. To generate the Fc RIIIA linker avitag and Fc RIIB linker AVITAG peptide constructs the pcDNA3.1 Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB constructs were digested with Not I and XbaI both cut in the vector sequence and a 86 base pair double stranded oligonucleotide consisting of NotI site at the 5 end and XbaI at the 3 end was ligated into the vector. This 86 bp fragment was generated by annealing two 5 phosphorylated reverse complement oligonucleotides shown in Table 12 as 5 and 3 linker.avitag primers with the restrictions sites for NotI and XbaI already pre designed. Equal volumes of each primer at 100 ng per ul were mixed and the DNA heated to 90 C. for 15 minutes and cooled at room temperature for an hour to anneal. This created a double stranded DNA fragment ready to be ligated to the pcDNA3.1 Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB constructs digested with the respective enzymes. Therefore the pcDNA3.1 FcR IIIA linker AVITAG and pcDNA3.1 FcR IIB linker AVITAG peptide were constructed.

Soluble Fc receptors Fc R fused to the 15 amino acid AVITAG peptide sequence Avidity CO Schatz P. J. 1993 11 1138 1143 at the C terminus of the protein cloned into pcDNA3.1 were generated by transiently transfecting 293H cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent Invitrogen CA . Supernatants were collected from the cultures and soluble FcR proteins were purified by passing the supernatants over an IgG sepharose column. Concentration of the soluble FcR AVITAG peptide fusion protein was quantitated by absorbance at 280 nm. The AVITAG peptide present on the soluble FcR proteins was biotinylated according to the manufacturer s protocol Avidity CO with the BirA enzyme a biotin ligase. A 1 100 final dilution of a cocktail of protease inhibitors Sigma catalog P8849 and 1 mg ml final concentration of Leupeptin Sigma L 8511 were added to the mixture to prevent degradation of the proteins. The BirA reaction was incubated at room temperature overnight following which the solution was concentrated using a Biomax 10K ultrafiltration device Millipore by centrifugation at 3500 rpm at 4 C. The protein was loaded onto an FPLC Superdex 200 HR 10 30 column Pharmacia Biotech in Tris HCl 20 mM pH 8.0 50 mM NaCl to separate the labeled soluble Fc R from free biotin.

Approximately 80 85 of the protein was biotinylated by the BirA enzyme Avidity CO . The streptavidin shift assay was used to determine the extent of biotinylation of the protein. Biotinylated protein was incubated with streptavidin MW 60 000 Daltons in different ratios. Unbiotinylated protein alone and streptavidin alone are included as controls to determine the extent of biotinylation. The incubation is carried out either on ice for 2 hours or overnight at 4 C. Samples are analyzed on a 4 12 SDS PAGE Bis Tris Invitrogen CA with reducing agent and without boiling of the samples. Streptavidin bound biotinylated protein migrates as a high molecular weight band. The extent of biotinylation is estimated by the amount of monomeric protein left in the sample. Absence of monomeric low molecular weight species and presence of a complex with molecular weight greater than streptavidin alone indicates a high degree of biotinylation.

Formation of Fc R tetrameric complexes was performed according to previously established methodologies for MHC class I tetramers See Busch D. H. et al. 1998 8 353 362 Altman J. D. et al. 1996 274 94 96 . The concentration of the biotinylated monomeric Fc R was calculated based on absorbance at 280 nm. One molecule of streptavidin phycoerythrin SA PE Molecular Probes OR has the capacity to bind 4 molecules of biotin. A 5 1 molar ratio of monomeric biotinylated Fc R to SA PE 5 monomeric biotinylated Fc R 1 SA PE was used to ensure an excess of biotinylated protein. The calculated molecular weight of SA PE is 300 000 Daltons therefore 303 mL of a 1 mg mL solution of streptavidin PE has 1 nmole of SA PE which was added to 5 nmole of protein. Efficient formation of tetrameric protein requires SA PE to be added in step wise increments. Half the amount of SA PE was added upfront and the remaining SA PE was added in small aliquots every 20 30 minutes at 4 C. in the dark. The intervals for the addition of the remaining SA PE is flexible. After the addition of SA PE was complete the solution was concentrated and loaded over an FPLC size exclusion column as above in phosphate buffered saline at pH 7.4. The fraction that eluted in the void volume with a molecular weight greater than SA PE alone was collected. Protease inhibitors were replenished to prevent protein degradation. The solution was concentrated and additional protease inhibitors were added to the final complex for storage. The final concentration of the soluble Fc R tetrameric complex was calculated based on the starting concentration of the biotinylated monomeric protein. For example if 500 g of biotinylated protein was used to make the tetrameric complex and the final concentrated tetramers were in a volume of 500 L the concentration is estimated to be approximately 1 mg mL The losses incurred during concentration are not taken into account as it is difficult to accurately determine how much is lost during each step of the formation of the tetramers. It is also not possible to take an absorbance at 280 nm to measure the concentration due to interference from the PE . Soluble Fc R tetrameric complexes were dispensed in small aliquots at 80 C. for long term storage with protease inhibitors. Sodium azide was not added to these preparations as the tetramers were used for screening a yeast display library. On thawing an aliquot the tetramers were stored at 4 C. for up to 1 week.

An ELISA was used to characterize the tetrameric Fc R complexes. Maxisorb F96 well plate Nunc was coated with 25 ng of human IgG in PBS buffer and incubated overnight at 4 C. The plates were washed with PBS 0.5 BSA 0.1 Tween 20 wash and diluent buffer before adding the combination of Fc RIIIA tetramers and test antibodies to determine blocking with 3G8 a mouse anti human Fc RIIIA antibody as described below The blocking step was performed as follows soluble Fc RIIIA tetramers at a fixed 0.5 mg ml final concentration were pre incubated with antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in buffer PBS 0.5 BSA 0.1 Tween 20. The final concentrations of the antibodies ranged from 60 mg mL to 0.25 mg mL. 3G8 is a mouse anti human Fc RIIIA antibody and for the purpose of this experiment a chimeric version was used i.e. the variable region of the antibody is a mouse anti human Fc RIIIA and the constant region of the heavy and light chains is from the IgG1 human region. A chimeric 4.4.20. D265A was also used in this experiment which is an anti fluorescein antibody such that the Fc region contains a mutation at position 265 where an aspartic acid is substituted with alanine in the human IgG1 which results in a reduced binding to Fc R. This antibody has been characterized previously See Clynes et al. 2000 6 443 446 Shields et al. 2001 276 6591 6604 . This antibody was used as negative isotype control.

The antibodies were allowed to bind to Fc RIIIA tetramers by pre incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. The mixture was then added to the IgG on the washed plate and incubated for and additional hour at room temperature. The plate was washed with buffer and DJ130c a mouse anti human Fc RIIIA antibody available from DAKO Denmark its epitope is distinct from that of the 3G8 antibody at 1 5000 dilution was added and allowed to incubate for 1 hr. at room temperature in order to detect the bound Fc RIIIA tetramers. Unbound antibodies were washed out with buffer and the bound DJ130c was detected with goat anti mouse peroxidase Jackson laboratories . This reagent will not detect the human Fc. After washing out the unbound peroxidase conjugated antibody the substrate TMB reagent BioFx was added to detect the extent of blocking with 3G8 versus the isotype control and the developed color was read at 650 nm.

For direct binding of soluble tetrameric Fc RIIIA to IgG by ELISA maxisorb plates were coated with 25 ng IgG as described above. The soluble tetrameric Fc RIIIA were added from 20 mg mL to 0.1 mg mL and the biotinylated monomeric soluble tetrameric Fc RIIIA were added at concentrations ranging from 20 mg mL to 0.16 mg mL. Detection was the same as above with DJ130c followed by goat anti mouse peroxidase antibody. Color developed with the TMB reagent and the plate was read at 650 nm.

Soluble Fc RIIIA AVITAG peptide fusion proteins were generated isolated and analyzed as described in the Material and Methods section using an ELISA assay and were shown to have similar properties as the non AVITAG peptide soluble Fc RIIIA protein data not shown . The fusion proteins were biotinylated and the tetrameric complexes were generated as described above.

The soluble Fc R tetrameric complex was then assessed for binding its ligand monomeric human IgG using an ELISA assay. Analysis by ELISA showed the soluble tetrameric Fc R complexes bind monomeric human IgG specifically. As shown in binding of soluble tetrameric Fc RIIIA to monomeric human IgG is blocked by 3G8 a mouse anti human Fc IIIA monoclonal antibody as monitored by the absorbance at 650 nm. On the other hand the 4 4 20 monoclonal antibody harboring the D265A mutation was not able to block the binding of soluble tetrameric Fc RIIIA to monomeric human IgG . This experiment thus confirms that binding of the soluble tetrameric Fc RIIIA complex occurs through the native ligand binding site.

Soluble Fc RIIIA Tetrameric Complex Binds Monomeric Human IgG with a Greater Avidity than Monomeric Soluble Fc RIIIA

The direct binding of soluble tetrameric Fc RIIIA to aggregated human IgG was assessed using an ELISA assay and compared to the direct binding of soluble monomeric Fc RIIIA to monometic human IgG. As shown in soluble tetrameric Fc RIIIA binds human IgG with a higher avidity 8 10 fold than the soluble monomeric receptor as monitored by the absorbance at 450 nm.

The binding of soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex was also assayed using magnetic beads coated with Fc Fragment purified from IgG1 . Soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex binds to the IgG1 Fc coated beads under conditions in which monomer binding is not detected. Specificity of binding was shown by pre incubating the receptor complex with an anti Fc RIIIA monoclonal antibody LNK16 which blocks Fc binding. This assay further confirms that soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex binds monomeric IgG through its normal ligand binding site and the avidity of the receptor is increased due to multiple binding sites within the complex.

The pYD1 vector Invitrogen is derived directly from a yeast replicating vector pCT302 Shusta et al. 2000 18 754 759 that has been successfully used to display T cell receptors and a number of scFVs. This plasmid is centromeric and harbors the TRP1 gene enabling a relatively constant copy number of 1 2 plasmids per cell in a trpl yeast strain. Directional cloning into the polylinker places the gene of interest under the control of the GALL promoter and in frame with AGA2. Fusion of the IgG Fc domain to the yeast Aga2p results in the extracellular secretion of the Aga2 Fc fusion protein and subsequent display of the Fc protein on the cell wall via disulfide bonding to the yeast Aga lp protein which is an integral cell wall protein.

In order to optimize the display levels different fragments from the IgG1 heavy chain were amplified by PCR and cloned into pYD1. Specifically the Fc region of the IgG1 heavy chain allotype IG1m a amino acids 206 447 was amplified by PCR Table 1 from the IMAGE clone 182740 digested with EcoRI SaII and ligated into the pYD1 vector Invitrogen . The initial clone from IMAGE contained a deletion of a single nucleotide at position 319 which was corrected by in vitro site directed mutagenesis to construct pYD GIF206 Quickchange Stratagene .

The CH1 CH3 fragment amino acids 118 447 was amplified from the heavy chain clone of the MAb B6.2 in the pCINEO vector using a 5 oligo mcr025 chl f and a 3 oligo H021 See Table 8 . The fragment was digested with BamHI NotI and ligated into the pYD1 vector to construct pYD CH1.

Constructs containing the Aga2p Fc fusion proteins and a control vector pYD1 lacking any insert were transformed into the yeast strain EBY100 Invitrogen MAT ura3 52 trpl leu2 l his3 200 pep4 HIS3 prb1 1.6R can1 GAL GAL AGA1 using a standard lithium acetate yeast transformation protocol Gietz et al. 1992 20 1425 Subsequently tryptophan prototrophs were selected on defined media. Amplification of independent cell populations and induction of Agalp and the Aga2p Fc fusion proteins were accomplished by growth in glucose followed by growth in media containing galactose as the primary carbon source for 24 48 hrs at 20 C. Growth in galactose induces expression of the Aga2 Fc fusion proteins via the GAL1 promoter which subsequently leads to the display of the Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface.

Expression of Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface was analyzed by immunostaining using a PE conjugated polyclonal F ab goat anti human Fc R and HP6017 Sigma antibody Jackson Immununoresearch Laboratories Inc. . Fluorescence microscopy shows peripheral staining for the three Fc fusion proteins. The control strain harboring vector alone shows little or no staining data not shown . FACS analysis was used to quantitate the staining . The yeast strain containing the CH1 CH3 fusion demonstrated the highest percentage of cells stained with both antibodies and F . The GIF227 construct showed the greatest mean fluorescence intensity panels C and G .

The natural context of the Fc and Fc R proteins places the receptor on the cell surface and the Fc as the soluble ligand however the yeast Fc surface display reverses the geometry of the natural interaction. Detection of the IgG1 Fc proteins on the surface of the yeast cell wall is complicated by both the low affinity of the Fc R for its ligand and the reverse geometry inherent in the display system. Although the latter point cannot be altered the avidity of the ligand was improved as explained above by forming soluble Fc R tetrameric complexes which allows detection of Fc R binding to the Fc fusion proteins expressed on the surface yeast cell wall.

To characterize the binding of soluble tetrameric Fc R complexes to the surface displayed Fc fusion proteins yeast cells expressing different Fc constructs were incubated with the soluble rFc RIIIA tetrameric complex and analyzed by FACS. Yeast cells harboring pYD CH1 displaying the wild type CH1 CH3 construct were bound by the soluble rFc RIIIA tetrameric complex as shown by FACS analysis. The GIF206 and GIF227 strains however showed little or no binding to the soluble rFc RIIIA tetrameric complex as shown by FACS analysis data not shown .

Mutations in the Fc region that block binding to the Fc Rs have been identified Shields et al. 2001 276 6591 6604 . One of these mutations D265A was incorporated into pYD CH1 and this mutant was expressed on the yeast cell surface. These cells were incubated with the soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex using a high concentration of ligand 0.15 mM of Fc 7.5 mM of D265A FACS analysis indicated that soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex bound to wild type Fc but soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex did not bind to the D265A Fc mutant indicating that Fc R is interacting with the normal FcR binding site in the lower hinge CH2 region .

Antibodies against the Fc RIIIA ligand binding site blocked binding of the soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex to the wild type Fc protein displayed on the yeast cell surface wall as analyzed by FACS . The binding of soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex was blocked by the 3G8 antibody as well as the LNK16 antibody another anti Fc RIIIA monoclonal antibody Advanced Immunological Tam et al. 1996 157 1576 1581 and was not blocked by an irrelevant isotype control. Therefore binding of soluble Fc RIIA tetrameric complex to the Fc proteins displayed on the yeast cell surface occurs through the normal ligand binding site. The limited binding of the Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex indicates that a subpopulation of cells have a correctly folded Fc that is accessible to Fc R. There are numerous reasons why only a subpopulation of cells may be able to bind the ligand for example they may be at different stages of cell cycle or the fusion proteins may not have been exported.

In order to determine the dissociation constant of the Fc RIIIA tetramer binding to the Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface the binding of a range of Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex was analyzed using FACS. Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex was titrated at concentrations of 1.4 M to 0.0006 M. Using the mean fluorescence intensity as a measure of binding affinity and nonlinear regression analysis the Kwas determined to be 0.006 M 0.001 data not shown .

A mutant Fc library was constructed using primers flanking the Fc fragment in the Fc CH1 construct and error prone PCR Genemorph Stratagene . The CH1 CH3 insert in vector pYD CH1 was amplified using a mutagenic PCR Genemorph Stratagene . Five reactions were carried out using the pYD upstream and pYD downstream primers Invitrogen . The resultant amplified fragment was digested with XHOI BamHI and ligated into pYD1. The ligation reaction was then transformed into XL10 ultracompetent cells Stratagene which resulted in 1 10transformants with 80 of the transformants containing inserts.

Sequence analysis of 28 random plasmids from the library indicated a mutation frequency 2 3 mutations kb with a breakdown of 40 conserved nucleotide changes and 60 of the mutations resulting in amino acid changes.

The library was transformed into the yeast strain EBY100 MAT ura3 52 trp l leu2 1 his3 200 pep4 HIS3 prb1 1.6R can l GAL GAL AGA 1 URA3 to a high efficiency 3.3 10transformants ug in 30 independent transformation reactions to create a total of 10yeast transformants Gietz et al. 1992 20 1425 . The library was pooled and amplified by growth in glucose.

ELISA plates Nunc F96 MaxiSorp Immunoplate were coated with 50 mi well of 0.5 mg ml BSA FITC in carbonate buffer at 4 C. and allowed to incubate overnight. Plates were washed with 1 PBS 0.1 Tween 20 PBST 3 times. 200 ml well of PBST 0.5 BSA was added and the plates were incubated for 30 mins at room temperature. Plates were washed three additional times with PBST. 50 ml well of 1 4 diluted 4 4 20 antibody approximately 3 mg mL which would lead to a final concentration of 0.7 0.8 mg well either wild type or containing an Fc mutant was added from conditional medium in PBST 0.5 BSA and allowed to incubate for 2 hrs at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBST three times. Purified biotinylated monomeric Fc RIIIA at 3 mg ml in PBST 0.5 BSA was added 50 l well to the plates and allowed to incubate for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBST three times. 50 ml well of a 1 5000 dilution of Streptavidin HRP Pharmacia RPN 123v in PBST 0.5 BSA was added and the plates were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed with PBST three times. 80 ml well of TMB reagent BioFX was then added to the plates and allowed to incubate for 10 15 minutes at room temperature in a dark place. The reactions were finally stopped by adding 40 ml well of stop solution 0.18 M sulfuric acid . Plates were then monitored for absorbance at 450 nm. After the first screen the interesting candidates were further confirmed by serial titration of 4 4 20 Fc mutants in the immuno complex based binding ELISA. A few modifications were made in this ELISA. For coating the plates 2 mg ml BSA FITC was used. Based on IgG quantitation results diluted 4 4 20Fc wild type or mutants from conditional medium was added to a final concentration of 1 0.5 0.25 0.125 0.063 and 0 mg ml in PBST 0.5 BSA.

Cells were grown in at least 10 mls of HSM Trp Ura pH 5.5 with glucose for 16 24 hrs or until ODwas greater than 2.0. Cells were spun down at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes. Cells were resuspended in an equal volume of HSM Trp Ura pH 7.0 with galactose. In a 125 ml flask 36 mls of galactose media was added and inoculated with 9 mls of culture which was incubated at 20 C. with shaking for 24 48 hrs. Growth was monitored by measuring ODat 8 16 hr intervals. Cells were harvested at 2K rpm for 5 minutes and resuspended in an equal volume of 1 PBS pH 7.4.

Equilibrium screen An appropriate amount of cells was incubated while maintaining an excess of ligand. For example it is preferred to start with a number of cells needed to ensure 10 fold coverage of the library. For the first sort with a library containing 10transformants 10cells should be used. In fact it is best to start with 10cells to compensate for loss during the staining protocol.

Incubation was typically done in a 1.5 mL tube in volumes of 20 100 mls for 1 hour at 4 C. in the dark on a rotator incubation buffer 1 PBS pH7.4 1 mg ml BSA . Cells were washed once in 500 ml of incubation buffer and spun down at 4K rpm for 2.5 minutes. Cells were resuspended in 100 ml incubation buffer and incubated with the second staining reagent. For Fc CH1 a F ab goat anti hFc F ab FITC antibody Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc. can be used to stain for CH1 expression. Staining was done with 1 mL for 30 minutes. Cells were washed additionally in 500 mL of incubation buffer and spun down at 4K rpm for 2.5 minutes resuspended in 1 mL IX PBS 1 mg mL BSA and analyzed by FACS.

After the 3rd and 4th sorts cells were plated directly on trp ura plates to identify individual mutants. This typically recovered 200 400 colonies per plate. After collection the cells were placed in 10 mLs of glucose media in a 50 mL conical tube and grown at 30 C. The whole procedure was repeated iteratively.

After induction in galactose media cells were harvested and co stained with soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex PE labeled and F ab of mouse anti human Fc FITC labeled Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories Inc. . Cells were analyzed by FACS and sort gates were used to select the cells that showed the highest affinity for the soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex relative to the amount of Fc expression on the cell surface . For example a cell containing a mutant Fc that binds better to the soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex may express fewer Fc fusion proteins on the yeast cell surface and this cell will be in the lower left hand corner of the sort gate.

Four consecutive sorts were done to enrich for those mutants that showed the highest affinity for the soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex. The gates for each successive sort were 5.5 1 0.2 and 0.1 . After the last sort cells were plated onto selective media and individual colonies were isolated. Each individual colony represented a clonal population of cells harboring a single Fc mutant within the Aga2 Fc fusion protein. Initially 32 independent colonies were picked and tested by FACS for binding to soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex . Eighteen mutants showed an increase in binding intensity as measured by the percentage of cells bound by soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex and the mean fluorescence intensity of the bound cells.

Mutations showing an increase in binding to Fc RIIIA were also tested for binding to soluble Fc RIIB tetrameric complex . Most mutations that lead to an increase in binding to the soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex also resulted in detection of Fc RIIB tetrameric complex staining . Based on both previous physical and genetic data some mutations that increase binding to Fc RIIIA are expected to also increase binding to Fc RIIB Shields et al. 2001 276 6591 6604 Sondermann et al. 2000 406 267 273 .

Isolation and analysis of mutations in the yeast system allows for fast identification of novel mutant alleles. The use of a heterologous system to isolate mutations could result in the identification of mutations that enhance binding through an alteration that results in misfolding or alteration in glycosylation that is specific to yeast. To analyze the Fc mutations in an immunoglobulin molecule that is produced in human cells the mutants were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector containing the heavy chain of the anti fluorescein monoclonal antibody 4 4 20 Kranz et al. 1982 257 12 6987 6995 . The mutant 4 4 20 heavy chains were transiently coexpressed with the light chain clones in the human kidney cell line 293H . Supernatants were collected and analyzed by ELISA .

According to the ELISA assay the majority of the mutants that were identified as having an enhanced affinity for the soluble monomeric Fc RIIIA complex in the secondary FACS analysis also showed an increase in binding to the soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex when present in the Fc region of the 4 4 20 monoclonal antibody produced in the human cell line . Two mutants number 16 and number 19 however showed a decrease in binding to the soluble Fc RIIIA monomeric complex.

Table 14 summarizes the mutations that have been identified and their corresponding binding characteristics to Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB as determined by both yeast display based assays and ELISA. In Table 14 the symbols represent the following corresponds to a 1 fold increase in affinity corresponds to a 50 increase in affinity corresponds to a 1 fold decrease in affinity corresponds to no change in affinity compared to a comparable molecule comprising a wild type Fc region.

Analysis of soluble Fc RIIB tetrameric complex binding shows that 7 out of the 8 mutants that showed an increase in binding to the soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex also had an increased binding to the soluble Fc RIIB tetrameric complex . One mutant number 8 showed a decrease in binding to the soluble Fc RIIB tetrameric complex. Three of the mutants show no difference in binding to either the soluble Fc RIIIA tetrameric complex or the soluble Fc RIIB tetrameric complex possibly due to mutantions that result in yeast specific alterations.

Effector cell preparation Peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were purified by Ficoll Paque Pharmacia 17 1440 02 Ficoll Paque density gradient centrifugation from normal peripheral human blood Biowhittaker Poietics 1 W 406 . Blood was shipped the same day at ambient temperature and diluted 1 1 in PBS and glucose 1 g 1 L and layered onto Ficoll in 15 mL conical tubes 3 mL Ficoll 4 mL PBS blood or 50 mL conical tubes 15 mL Ficoll 20 mL PBS blood . Centrifugation was done at 1500 rpm 400 rcf for 40 minutes at room temperature. The PBMC layer was removed approximately 4 6 mL from 50 mL conical tube and diluted 1 10 in PBS which contains no Ca or Mg in a 50 mL conical tube and spun for an additional ten minutes at 1200 rpm 250 rcf at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the pellets were resuspended in 10 12 mL PBS which contains no Ca or Mg transferred to 15 mL conical tubes and spun for another 10 minutes at 1200 rpm at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the pellets were resuspended in a minimum volume 1 2 mL of media Isocove s media IMDM 10 fetal bovine serum FBS 4 mM Gln Penicillin Streptomycin P S . The resuspended PBMC were diluted to the appropriate volume for the ADCC assay two fold dilutions were done in an ELISA 96 well plate Nunc F96 MaxiSorp Immunoplate . The yield of PBMC was approximately 3 5 10cells per 40 50 mL of whole blood.

Target cell preparation Target cells used in the assay were SK BR 3 ATCC Accession number HTB 30 Trempe et al. 1976 33 41 Raji ATCC Accession number CCL 86 Epstein et al. 1965 34 231 40 or Daudi cells ATCC Accession number CCL 213 Klein et al. 1968 28 1300 10 resuspended in 0.5 mL IMDM media and they were labeled with europium chelate bis acetoxymethyl 2 2 6 2 terpyridine 6 6 dicarboxylate BATDA reagent Perkin Elmer DELFIA reagent C136 100 . K562 cells ATCC Accession number CCL 243 were used as control cells for NK activity. The Daudi and Raji cells were spun down the SK BR 3 cells were trypsinized for 2 5 minutes at 37 C. 5 COand the media was neutralized prior to being spun down at 200 350 G. The number of target cells used in the assays was about 4 5 10cells and it did not exceed 5 10since labeling efficiency was best with as few as 2 10cells. Once the cells were spun down the media was aspirated to 0.5 mL in 15 mL Falcon tubes. 2.5 l of BATDA reagent was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 C. 5 COfor 30 minutes. Cells were washed twice in iomL PBS and 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole SP SIGMA S 9509 and twice in 10 mL assay media cell media 0.125 mM sulfinpyrazole . Cells were resuspended in 1 mL assay media counted and diluted.

When SK BR 3 cells were used as target cells after the first PBS SP wash the PBS SP was aspirated and 500 g mL of FITC was added PIERCE 461110 in IMDM media containing SP Gln and P S and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C. 5 CO. Cells were washed twice with assay media resuspended in 1 mL assay media counted and diluted.

Antibody Opsonization Once target cells were prepared as described supra they were opsonized with the appropriate antibodies. In the case of Fc variants 50 L of 1 10cells mL were added to 2 concentration of the antibody harboring the Fc variant. Final concentrations were as follows Ch 4 4 20 final concentration was 0.5 1 g mL and Ch4D5 final concentration was 30 ng L 1 ng mL.

Opsonized target cells were added to effector cells to produce an effector target ratio of 75 1 in the case of the 4 4 20 antibodies with Fc variants. In the case of the Ch4D5 antibodies with Fc variants effector target ratio of 50 1 or 75 1 were achieved. Effective PBMC gradient for the assay ranges from 100 1 to 1 1. Spontaneous release SR was measured by adding 100 L of assay media to the cells maximal release MR was measured by adding 4 TX 100. Cells were spun down at 200 rpm in a Beckman centrifuge for 1 minute at room temperature at 57 G. Cells were incubated for 3 3.5 hours at 37 C. 5 CO. After incubation the cells were spun at 1000 rpm in a Beckman centrifuge about 220 g for five minutes at 10 C. 20 l of supernatant was collected 200 L of Eu solution was added and the mixture was shaken for 15 minutes at room temperature at 120 rpm on a rotary shaker. The fluorescence was quantitated in a time resolved fluorometer Victor 1420 Perkin Elmer 

As described above the variant Fc regions were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector containing the heavy chain of the anti fluoresceine monoclonal antibody 4 4 20 Kranz et al. 1982 257 12 6987 6995 . The variant 4 4 20 heavy chains were transiently coexpressed with the light chain clones in the human kidney cell line 293H . Supernatants were collected and analyzed using the ADCC assay. shows that ADCC activity of the mutants is concentration dependent. As summarized in Table 8 five immunoglobulins with variant Fc regions had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to wild type ch 4 4 20. The five mutants were as follows MGFc 27 G316D A378V D399E MGFc 31 P247L N421K MGFc 10 K288N A330S P396L MGFc 28 N315I V379M T394M MGFc 29 F243I V379L G420V .

Additional 4 4 20 immunoglobulins with variant Fc regions were assayed for their ADCC activity relative to a 4 4 20 immunoglobulin with a wild type Fc region. These results are summarized in Table 15.

ADCC assays were also carried out using the same protocol as previously described for the 4 4 20 antibody however the variant Fc regions were cloned into a humanized antibody Ab4D5 which is specific for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HER2 neu . In this case SK BR 3 cells were used as the target cells that were opsonized with a HER2 neu antibody carrying a variant Fc region. HER2 neu is endogenously expressed by the SK BR 3 cells and therefore present on the surface these cells. shows the ADCC activity of HER2 neu antibodies carrying variant Fc regions. Table 16 summarizes the results of ADCC activity of the mutants in the context of the HER2 neu antibody. Normalization was carried out by comparing the concentration of the mutant to the wild type antibody required for a specific value of percent cell lysis.

As shown in MGFc 5 V379M MGFc 9 P243I V379L MGFc 10 K288N A330S P396L MGFc 13 K334E T359N T366S and MGFc 27 G316D A378V D399E mutants that were cloned in to the humanized anti HER2 neu antibody exhibited a higher specific lysis of SK BR 3 cells relative to the wild antibody.

Kinetic parameters of the binding of ch4 4 20 antibodies harboring Fc mutants to Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB were analyzed using a BIAcore assay BIAcore instrument 1000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . The Fc RIIIA used in this assay was a soluble monomeric protein the extracellular region of Fc RIIIA joined to the linker AVITAG sequence as described in Section 6.2 supra. The Fc RIIB used in this assay was a soluble dimeric protein prepared in accordance with the methodology described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 439 709 filed on Jan. 13 2003 which is incorporated herein by reference. Briefly the Fc RIIB used was the extracellular domain of Fc RIIB fused to the hinge CH2 CH3 domain of human IgG2.

BSA FITC 36 g mL in 10 mM Acetate Buffer at pH 5.0 was immobilized on one of the four flow cells flow cell 2 of a sensor chip surface through amine coupling chemistry by modification of carboxymethyl groups with mixture of NHS EDC such that about 5000 response units RU of BSA FITC was immobilized on the surface. Following this the unreacted active esters were capped off with an injection of 1M Et NH2. Once a suitable surface was prepared ch 4 4 20 antibodies carrying the Fc mutations were passed over the surface by one minute injections of a 20 g mL solution at a 5 L mL flow rate. The level of ch 4 4 20 antibodies bound to the surface ranged between 400 and 700 RU. Next dilution series of the receptor Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein in HBS P buffer 10 mM HEPES 150 mM NaCl 0.005 Surfactant P20 3 mM EDTA pH 7.4 were injected onto the surface at 100 L min Antibody regeneration between different receptor dilutions was carried out by single 5 second injections of 100 mM NaHCOpH 9.4 3M NaCl.

The same dilutions of the receptor were also injected over a BSA FITC surface without any ch 4 4 20 antibody at the beginning and at the end of the assay as reference injections.

Once an entire data set was collected the resulting binding curves were globally fitted using computer algorithms supplied by the manufacturer BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . These algorithms calculate both the Kand K from which the apparent equilibrium binding constant Kis deduced as the ratio of the two rate constants i.e. K K . More detailed treatments of how the individual rate constants are derived can be found in the BIAevaluaion Software Handbook BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. .

Binding curves for two different concentrations 200 nM and 800 nM for Fc RIIIA and 200 nM and 400 nM for Fc RIIB fusion protein were aligned and responses adjusted to the same level of captured antibodies and the reference curves were subtracted from the experimental curves. Association and dissociation phases were fitted separately. Dissociation rate constant was obtained for interval 32 34 sec of the dissociation phase association phase fit was obtained by a 1 1 Langmuir model and base fit was selected on the basis Rand chicriteria.

The kinetic parameters Kand K that were determined from the BIAcore analysis correlated with the binding characteristic of the mutants as determined by an ELISA assay and the functional activity of the mutants as determined in an ADCC assay. Specifically as seen in Table 17 mutants that had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to the wild type protein and had an enhanced binding to Fc RIIIA as determined by an ELISA assay had an improved Kfor Fc RIIIA i.e. a lower K . Therefore a lower Kvalue for Fc RIIIA for a mutant Fc protein relative to a wild type protein may be likely to have an enhanced ADCC function. On the other hand as seen in Table 18 mutants that had an enhanced ADCC activity relative to the wild type protein and had a reduced binding for Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein as determined by an ELISA assay had a higher Kfor Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein.

Thus the Kvalues for Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB can be used as predictive measures of how a mutant will behave in a functional assay such as an ADCC assay. In fact ratios of Kvalues for Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB Fc fusion protein of the mutants to the wild type protein were plotted against ADCC data . Specifically in the case of Kvalues for Fc RIIIA the ratio of K wt K mutant was plotted against the ADCC data and in the case of Kvalues for Fc RIIB the ratio of K mut K wt was plotted against the ADCC data. Numbers higher than one 1 show a decreased dissociation rate for Fc RIIIA and an increased dissociation rate for Fc RIIB Fc relative to wild type. Mutants that fall within the indicated box have a lower off rate for Fc RIIIA binding and a higher off rate for Fc RIIB Fc binding and possess an enhanced ADCC function.

The following mutant screens were aimed at identifying additional sets of mutants that show improved binding to Fc RIIIA and reduced binding to Fc RIIB. Secondary screening of selected Fc variants was performed by ELISA followed by testing for ADCC in the 4 4 20 system. Mutants were than selected primarily based on their ability to mediate ADCC via 4 4 20 using Fluorescein coated SK BR3 cells as targets and isolated PBMC from human donors as the effector cell population. Fc mutants that showed a relative increase in ADCC e.g. an enhancement by a factor of 2 were than cloned into anti HER2 neu or anti CD20 chAbs and tested in an ADCC assay using the appropriate tumor cells as targets. The mutants were also analyzed by BIAcore and their relative Kwere determined.

Screen 1 Sequential solid phase depletion and selection using Magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIB followed by selection with magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIIA. The aim of this screen was identification of Fc mutants that either no longer bind Fc RIIB or show reduced binding to Fc RIIB. A 10 fold excess of the na ve library 10cells was incubated with magnetic beads My One Dynal coated with Fc RIIB. Yeast bound to beads were separated from the non bound fraction by placing the tube containing the mixture in a magnetic field. Those yeast cells that were not bound to the beads were removed and placed in fresh media. They were next bound to beads that were coated with Fc RIIIA. Yeast bound to beads were separated from the nonbound fraction by placing the tube containing the mixture in a magnetic field. Nonbound yeast were removed and the bound cells were removed by vigorous vortexing. The recovered cells were regrown in glucose containing media and reinduced in selective media containing galactose. The selection process was repeated. The final culture was than used to harvest DNA. Inserts containing the Fc domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into 4 4 20. Approximately 90 Fc mutants were screened by 4 4 20 ELISA and ADCC assays and the resultant positive mutants are shown in Table 19.

Screens 2 3 Mutants Selected by FACS Equilibrium and Kinetic Screening The first library screen identified a mutation at position 396 changing the amino acid from Proline to Leucine P396L . This Fc variant showed increased binding to both Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB. A second library was constructed using P396L as a base line. PCR mutagenesis was used to generate 10mutants each of which contained the P396L mutation and contained additional nucleotide changes. The P396L library was screened using two sets of conditions.

An equilibrium screen was performed using biotinylated Fc RIIIA linker avitag as a monomer using methods already described. Approximately 10 fold excess of library 10cells was incubated in a 0.5 mL of approximately 7 nM Fc RIIIA for 1 hr. The mixture was sorted by FACS selecting top 1.2 of binders. Selected yeast cells were grown in selective media containing glucose and reinduced in selective media containing galactose. The equilibrium screen was repeated a second time and the sort gate was set to collect the top 0.2 of binders. The selected yeast cells were then grown under selective conditions in glucose. This culture was than used to harvest DNA. Inserts containing the Fc domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into the nucleotide sequence encoding 4 4 20 variable domain using methods already described. Approximately 90 Fc mutants were screened by 4 4 20 ELISA and ADCC and the resultant positive mutants are shown in Table 20.

A kinetic screen was also implemented to identify mutants with improved Kin binding Fc RIIIA Conditions were established for screening the P396L library using a strain with the P396L Fc variant displayed on the yeast surface. Briefly cells grown under inducing conditions were incubated with 0.1 M biotinylated Fc RIIIA linker avitag monomer for 1 hr. The cells were washed to remove the labeled ligand. Labeled cells were then incubated for different times with 0.1 M unlabeled Fc RIIIA linker avitag monomer washed and then stained with SA PE for FACS analysis . Cells were also stained with goat anti human Fc to show that the Fc display was maintained during the experiment.

Based on the competition study it was determined that a 1 minute incubation resulted in approximately 50 loss of cell staining. This time point was chosen for the kinetic screen using the P396L library. Approximately 10 fold excess of library 10cells was incubated with 0.1 M biotinylated Fc RIIIA linker avitag monomer in a 0.5 mL volume. Cells were washed and then incubated for 1 minute with unlabeled ligand. Subsequently the cells were washed and labeled with SA PE. The mixture was sorted by FACS selecting the top 0.3 of binders. Selected yeast cells were grown in selective media containing glucose and reinduced in selective media containing galactose. The kinetic screen was repeated a second time and the sort gate was set to collect the top 0.2 of binders. The nonselcted P396L library was compared to the yeast cells selected for improved binding by FACS . The histograms show the percentage of cells that are costained with both Fc RIIIA PE and goat anti human Fc FITC upper right .

The selected yeast cells from the second sort were then grown under selective conditions in glucose. This culture was than used to harvest DNA. Inserts containing the Fc domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into the nucleotide sequence encoding 4 4 20 variable domain using methods described above. Approximately 90 Fc mutants were screened by 4 4 20 ELISA and ADCC and the resultant positive mutants are shown in Table 21.

Screens 4 and 5 Combining the Solid Phase Fc RIIIB Depletion Step with Fc RIIIA Selection by FACs Sort Using the Fc RIIIA 158V Allele

Analysis of Fc variants from Screen 1 showed that the mutations that were selected from the secondary screen had improved binding to both Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB. Therefore the data suggested that sequential depletion and selection using magnetic beads solid phase under the established conditions did not efficiently select for differential binding of Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB. Therefore in order to screen more effectively for mutants that bind Fc RIIIA while having reduced or no binding to Fc RIIB the solid phase Fc RIIB depletion step was combined with Fc RIIIA selection by FACs sort. This combination identified Fc variants that bind Fc RIIIA with greater or equal affinity than wild type Fc.

A 10 fold excess of the na ve library 10 was incubated with magnetic beads coated with Fc RIIB. Yeast bound to beads were separated from the non bound fraction by placing the tube containing the mixture in a magnetic field. Those yeast cells that were not bound to the beads were removed and placed in fresh media and subsequently reinduced in media containing galactose. The Fc RIIB depletion by magnetic beads was repeated 5 times. The resulting yeast population was analyzed and found to show greater than 50 cell staining with goat anti human Fc and a very small percentage of cells were stained with Fc RIIIA. These cells were then selected twice by a FACS sort using 0.1 M biotinylated Fc RIIIA linker avitag data not shown . The Fc RIIIA was the 158V allotype. Yeast cells were analyzed for both Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIB binding after each sort and compared to binding by wild type Fc domain .

The selected yeast cells from the second sort were then grown under selective conditions in glucose. This culture was then used to harvest DNA. Inserts containing the Fc domain were amplified by PCR and cloned into the nucleotide sequence encoding 4 4 20 variable domain. Approximately 90 Fc mutants were screened by 4 4 20 ELISA and ADCC and the resultant positive mutants are shown in Table 22 mutants 61 66 .

Screening of Fc mutants using the 158F allele of Fc RIIIA Two different alleles of Fc RIIIA receptor exist that have different binding affinities for the IgG1 Fc domain Koene et al. 1997 90 1109 1114 Wu et al. 1997 100 1059 70 . The 158F allele binds to the Fc domain with a binding constant 5 10 fold lower than the 158V allele. Previously all of the Fc screens using yeast display were done using the high binding 158V allele as a ligand. In this experiment Fc mutants were selected from the Fc RIIB depleted yeast population using biotinylated Fc RIIIA 158F linker avitag monomer as a ligand. The sort gate was set to select the top 0.25 percent Fc RIIIA 158F binders. The resulting enriched population was analyzed by FACS . Individual clones were then isolated and their binding to different Fc Rs were analyzed by FACS . Analysis of individual clones from the population resulted in the identification of a single mutant harboring 5 mutations MgFc67 V284M S298N K334E R355W R416S which had an enhanced binding to Fc RIIIA and a reduced binding to Fc RIIB.

Mutants that were selected in the above screens were then analyzed using a standard ADCC assay to determine the relative rates of lysis mediated by ch4 4 20 harboring the Fc mutants. ch4 4 20 antibodies carrying the Fc variants were constructed using methods already described above. SK BR3 cells were used as targets and effector cells were PBMC that were isolated from donors using a Ficoll gradient as described supra Section 6.7 . The ADCC activity results for the mutants are summarized in Table 23.

As seen in Table 23 mutants isolated using the above primary and secondary screens based on Fc RIIB depletion and Fc RIIIA selection showed enhanced ADCC activity relative to wild type.

Mutants 37 38 39 41 43 were analyzed using 0.5 g mL ch4 4 20. All other antibodies were tested at 1 g mL. All rates were normalized to wild type ch4 4 20 IgG1 .

Mutants were additionally cloned into the heavy chain of antitumor monoclonal antibody 4D5 anti HER2 neu and anti CD20 monoclonal antibody 2H7 by replacing the Fc domain of these monoclonal antibodies. These chimeric monoclonal antibodies were expressed and purified and tested in an ADCC assay using standard methods by transient transfection into 293H cells and purification over protein G column. The chimeric 4D5 antibodies were tested in an ADCC assay using SK BR3 cells as targets whereas the chimeric 2H7 antibodies were tested in an ADCC assay using Daudi cells as targets .

Secondary Screen of Mutants via BIAcore Mutants that were selected in the above screens were then analyzed by BIAcore to determine the kinetic parameters for binding Fc RIIIA 158V and Fc RIIB. The method used was similar to that disclosed in Section 6.8 supra.

The data displayed are Kvalues relative to wild type off rates as determined from experiments using the Fc mutants in the ch4 4 20 monoclonal antibody. Relative numbers greater than one indicate a decrease in Krate. Numbers less than one indicate an increase in off rate.

Mutants that showed a decrease in off rates for Fc RIIIA were MgFc38 K392 P396L MgFc43 Y319F P352L P396L MgFc42 D221E D270E V308A Q311H P396L G402D MgFc43b K288R T307A K344E P396L MgFc44 K334N P396L MgFc46 P217S P396L MgFc49 K261N K210M P396L . Mutants that showed a decrease in off rate for Fc RIIB were MgFc38 K392 P396L MgFc39 E293V Q295E A327T MgFc43 K288R T307A K344E P396L MgFc44 K334N P396L . The Biacore data is summarized in Table 24.

Fc variants that show improved binding to Fc RIIIA were tested by PBMC based ADCC using 60 1 effector target ratio. Two different tumor model systems were used as targets SK BR3 anti HER2 neu and Daudi anti CD20 . Percent specific Lysis was quantitated for each mutant. Linear regression analysis was used to plot the data setting the maximal percent lysis at 100 .

ADCC is activated on immune system effector cells via a signal transduction pathway that is triggered by an interaction between low affinity Fc R and an immune complex. Effector cell populations were derived from either primary blood or activated monocyte derived macrophages MDM . Target cells were loaded with europium and incubated with chimeric MAb and subsequently incubated with effector cell populations. Europium works the same way as Cr but it is non radioactive and the released europium is detected in a fluorescent plate reader. Lymphocytes harvested from peripheral blood of donors PBM using a Ficoll Paque gradient Pharmacia contain primarily natural killer cells NK . The majority of the ADCC activity will occur via the NK containing Fc RIIIA but not Fc RIIB on their surface.

Experiments were performed using two different target cell populations SK BR 3 and Daudi expressing HER2 neu and CD20 respectively. ADCC assays were set up using Ch4 4 20 FITC coated SK BR 3 Ch4D5 SKBR3 and RITUXAN Daudi data not shown . Chimeric MAbs were modified using Fc mutations identified. Fc mutants were cloned into Ch4D5. Purified Ab was used to opsonize SK BR 3 cells or Daudi cells. Fc mutants were cloned into Ch4D5.

Results. Fc mutants showed improved PBMC mediated ADCC activity in SK BR3 cells . The plot shows linear regression analysis of a standard ADCC assay. Antibody was titrated over 3 logs using an effector to target ratio of 75 1. lysis Experimental release SR MR SR 100.

Fc R dependent tumor cell killing is mediated by macrophage and NK cells in mouse tumor models Clynes et al. 1998 PNAS USA 95 652 6 . Elutriated monocytes from donors were used as effector cells to analyze the efficiency Fc mutants to trigger cell cytotoxicity of target cells in ADCC assays. Expression patterns of Fc RI Fc R3A and Fc R2B are affected by different growth conditions. Fc R expression from frozen monocytes cultured in media containing different combinations of cytokines and human serum were examined by FACS using FcR specific MAbs. . Cultured cells were stained with Fc R specific antibodies and analyzed by FACS to determine MDM Fc R profiles. Conditions that best mimic macrophage in vivo Fc R expression i.e. showed the greatest fraction of cells expressing CD16 and CD32B were used in a monocyte derived macrophage MDM based ADCC assay. For the experiment in frozen elutriated monocytes were grown for 8 days in DMEM and 20 FBS containing either M CSF condition 1 or GM CSF condition 2 . For the experiment in frozen elutriated monocytes were cultured for 2 days in DMEM and 20 FBS containing GM CSF IL 2 and IFN prior to ADCC assay. Serum free conditions have also been developed which allow for high levels of CD16 and CD32B expression data not shown . Briefly purified monocytes were grown for 6 8 days in Macrophage SFM Invitrogen containing GM CSF M CSF IL 6 IL 10 and IL 1 . While the incidence of CD32B CD16 cells in these cultures is highest using a mixture of cytokines combinations of two of more cytokines will also enhance Fc R expression M CSF IL 6 M CSF IL 10 or M CSF IL 1 . For ADCC assays IFN is added for the final 24 48 hours.

MDM based ADCC required incubation times of 16 hrs to observe target cell killing. Target cells were loaded with Indium Ill which is retained for long incubations within the target cells. Indium release was quantitated using a gamma counter. All other reagents Abs and target cells were similar to the PBMC based ADCC assay. ADCC activity due to Fc RI can be efficiently blocked using the anti FcRI blocking antibody M21 Ancell . The assay conditions differ slightly from the PBMC based assay. 20 1 target to effector 18 14 hr incubation at 37 C.

Fc mutants that show improved PBMC ADCC increased binding to Fc RIIIA or decreased binding to Fc RIIB were tested .

Fc mutants were originally identified based on their increased binding to Fc RIIIA. These mutants were subsequently validated for their improved affinity for all low affinity receptors and in many cases improved activity in ADCC mediated by PBMC. In vivo antibody mediated cytotoxicity can occur through multiple mechanisms. In addition to ADCC other possible mechanisms include complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC and apoptosis. The binding of C1q to the Fc region of an immunoglobulin initiates as cascade resulting in cell lysis by CDC. The interaction between C1q and the Fc has been studies in a series of Fc mutants. The results of these experiments indicate that C1q and the low affinity FcR bind to overlapping regions of the Fc however the exact contact residues within the Fc vary.

Mutants that showed improved ADCC in the PBMC based assay were examined for their effect in CDC. Antibodies were analyzed in the anti CD20 Ch mAb 2H7. We detected improved CDC for each mutant ch mAb tested. Interestingly even though these mutants were selected for their improved ADCC they also show enhanced CDC

MATERIALS AND METHODS. CDC assay was used to test the Fc mutants using anti CD20 and Daudi cells as targets. Guinea Pig Serum was used as the source for complement US Biological . The CDC assay was similar to PBMC based ADCC. Target cells were loaded with europium and opsonized with ChMAb. However complement guinea pig serum was added instead of effector cells. shows a flow chart of the assay. Anti CD20 ChMab over 3 orders of magnitude was titrated. lysis was calculated. Daudi cells 3 10 were labeled with BADTA reagent. 1 10cells were aliquoted into wells in a 96 well plate. Antibodies were titrated into the wells using 3 fold dilutions. The opsonization reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 40 minutes at 37 C. in 5 CO. Guinea pig serum was added to a final conc. of 20 . The reaction was allowed to proceed for 3.5 hrs at 37 C. in 5 CO. Subsequently 100 uls of cell media was added to the reaction and cells were spun down. For detection 20 uls of the supernatant was added to 200 uls of the Europium solution and the plates were read in the Victor2 Wallac .

RESULTS All mutants that show improved binding for either activating FcR or C1q were placed in the CDC assay . Fc mutants that showed enhanced binding to Fc RIIIA also showed improved complement activity Each of the mutants show enhanced complement activity compared to wild type. The mutants tested are double mutants. In each case one of the mutations present is P396L.

To determine whether the increase in CDC correlated with increased binding of C1q to IgG1 Fc binding between the two proteins was measured in realtime using surface plasmon resonance. In order to examine the binding between C1q and an IgG1 Fc the Fc variants were cloned into an anti CD32B ch mAb 2B6. This allowed us to capture the wt and mutant antibodies to the glass slide via soluble CD32B protein . Three of the four mutants tested in CDC were also examined in the Biacore. All 3 showed greatly enhanced Kcompare to wild type Fc . Biacore format for C1q binding to 2B6 mutants demonstrate enhanced binding of mutants with P396L mutation . Mutation D270E can reduce C1q binding at different extent. A summary of the kinetic analysis of Fc R and C1q binding is depicted in the table 25 below.

Based on a selection for Fc mutants that reduce binding to Fc RIIB and increase binding to Fc RIIA 131H a number of mutations including D270E was identified. Each mutation was tested individually for binding to the low affinity Fc receptors and their allelic variants by Biacore performed as described above in the context of the 4D5 ChAb anti HER2 neu .

D270E had the binding characteristics that suggested it would specifically reduce Fc RIIB binding. D270E was tested in combination with mutations that were previously identified based on their improved binding to all FcR.

RESULTS. As shown in Tables 26 and 27 and addition of D270E mutation enhances Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIA H131 binding and reduces binding to Fc RIIB. shows the plot of MDM ADCC data against the Kas determined for CD32A H131H binding for select mutants.

Fc mutations which enhance Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIA binding and reduce binding to Fc RIIB have been suggested to positively correlate with the appearance or improvement of both ADCC and complement function Section 6.8 . This hypothesis was tested by cloning promising mutations into the heavy chain of the chimeric antitumor monoclonal antibody 4D5 anti HER2 neu chimeric anti CD32B monoclonal antibody ch2B6 and the anti CD20 antibody RITUXIN anti CD20 antibody. Mutations were cloned into the heavy chains of the antibodies using standard techniques. These chimeric antibodies were expressed by transient transfection into 293H cells and purified over a protein G column. Variant 4D5 antibodies were analyzed for alterations in kinetic parameters using a BIAcore assay BIAcore instrument 1000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. and associated software as described supra Section 6.8 . Binding ability of 4D5 and ch2B6 antibodies was characterized by immunostaining cells with either FITC conjugated variant antibody or the variant antibodies and a PE conjugated polyclonal F ab goat anti human Fc antibody Jackson Immununoresearch Laboratories Inc. . FACS analysis was used to quantitate the staining.

The chimeric variant antibodies were tested in an ADCC or CDC assay as described supra Section 6.10 and 6.11 respectively . For both 4D5 and ch2B6 antibodies the effects of antigen density on binding or on cell lysis by ADCC CDC were tested by using cells with high or low expression of antigen. Antigen density was determined Using QUANTUM SIMPLY CELLULAR kit from Bangs Laboratories Inc. Fishers Ind. according to the manufacturer s instructions. Target cells for 4D5 antibodies were SK BR3 cells high Her2 neu expression and HT29 cells low Her2 neu expression . Target cells for ch2B6 antibodies were Daudi cells or BL41 cells high CD32B expression and Ramos cells low CD32B expression . Target cells for RITUXIN anti CD20 antibody were CHO cells which were engineered to express both CD32B and CD20 using standard techniques.

Although the Fc mutant 31 60 P247L N421K D270E did not enhance 4D5 binding to cells expressing low levels of Her2 neu this modification as well as variants 71 D270E G316D R416G 59 60 K370E P396L D270E 55 60 R255L P396L D270E 51 60 Q419H P396L D270E 55 60 F243L R255L P396L D270E F243L and 74 P396L F243L R292P V305I P396L improved the wild type ADCC mediated lysis of cells expressing low levels of antigen .

When similar Fc mutations variants 31 60 59 60 and 71 are introduced into an antibody with only limited binding to cells expressing low levels of antigen and no native effector function on the same cells the results are more dramatic. demonstrates that wild type ch2B6 binding to Ramos cells can be substantially improved by the introduction the Fc mutations of variant 31 60 and 59 60. Similarly effector function can be introduced by Fc mutations. Where the wild type antibody has no detectable effector function Fc mutations can result in a gain of function phenotype. Mutations which improved the binding of ch2B6 to Ramos cells also enabled the mutated antibody to mediate ADCC variant 31 60 or CDC variants 31 60 and 71 respectively . also show the spectrum of response available dependent on the specific mutation. Where the wild type ch2B6 antibody is capable of mediating at least some effector function e.g. in cells with high expression of CD32B Daudi cells the same Fc mutations variant 31 60 and 71 improve the effect .

The increase in ADCC activity was shown to be a function of the Fc modification and not the target antigen. The mutation variant 55 60 previously identified as improving ADCC activity in 4D5 antibody conferred effector function to the anti CD20 antibody RITUXIN anti CD20 antibody. A and B show that the engineered CHO cell line expressed similar levels of CD32B and CD20 when tested with FITC conjugated 2B6 or RITUXIN anti CD20 antibody respectively. Although the cells were sensitive to ADCC mediated by wild type 2B6 ADCC activity was completely undetectable using wild type RITUXIN anti CD20 antibody . The introduction of the mutation variant 55 60 into RITUXIN anti CD20 antibody as in 4D5 was however able to confer effector function to the modified antibody .

Possible mechanisms by which the mutated antibodies were able to improve both binding and effector function were observed when the binding affinities of variant ch2B6 antibodies to Fc RIIB were correlated with their ability to bind Ramos cells . For example variant 55 60 had both the highest kand binding affinity to Ramos cells. It is theorized the limited ability of the wild type antibody to bind Fc RIIB is due to Fc Fc RIIB interaction effectively withdrawing the additional cell surface receptors from further antibody binding. The theory was investigated by challenging opsonized Ramos cells with CD16A an activating Fc R. In accord with the theory at low antigen density Fc engineered ch2B6 but not wild type Fc was able bind the activating receptor .

6.15 Effect of Light Chain Glycosylation on Fc Binding to Fc R and Mediation of ADCC and Compliment Activity

As demonstrated in Sections 6.8 and 6.14 Fc mutations can introduce or improve both the binding and effector function of antibodies. The effect of light chain glycosylation on these abilities was investigated by combining a mutation which eliminated glycosylation of the light chain region YA substitution at positions 50 and 51 of the light chain amino acid sequence with the previously identified Fc mutations which induced or improved ADCC or complement function as listed in Table 27.

Mutations were cloned into both the heavy and light chains of anti Fc R monoclonal antibody ch2B6. These chimeric antibodies were expresses and purified using standard methods by transient transfection into 293H cells and purification over a protein G column. Variant antibodies were analyzed for alterations in kinetic parameters using a BIAcore assay BIAcore instrument 1000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. and associated software as described supra Section 6.8 . Binding ability was characterized by immunostaining cells with the variant antibodies and a PE conjugated polyclonal F ab goat anti human Fc R antibody Jackson Immununoresearch Laboratories Inc. . FACS analysis was used to quantitate the staining. The effects of antigen density were investigated by immunostaining high Daudi cells and EL 4 CD32B cells and low Ramos antigen expressing cells.

The chimeric variant antibodies were tested in an ADCC or CDC assay using Ramos cells as targets as described supra Section 6.10 and 6.11 respectively .

BIAcore analysis revealed that previously identified mutations which enhanced Fc RIIIA binding and reduced binding to Fc RIIB were unaffected by the glycosylation state of the light chain Table 27 .

The improvements in mutant antibody binding noted in the BIAcore analysis were not observed when cells with high antigen expression were immunostained and analyzed by FACS . Variant antibodies failed to improve binding exhibiting characteristics similar to the wild type antibody. However when the Ramos cell line was tested wild type ch2B6 and ch2B6 variant 31 60 bound at levels significantly above that of the other variants tested . As the immunostaining protocol more closely approximates the in vivo conditions of antigen antibody interaction the differences in the two analyses may suggest that light chain glycosylation is necessary for biologically relevant activity of the antibody.

This suggestion was furthered by the ADCC and CDC assays. Although these Fc mutations resulted in a gain of function for 4D5 antibodies as outlined in Section 6.14 for ch2B6 the ability to effect lysis was dependent on the glycosylation state of the light chain of the antibody .

6.16 Effect of Mutations Identified as Enhancing ADCC Function in ADCC Assay Using Tumor Cells Isolated from RITUXAN Anti CD20 Antibody Treated Patients

Fc mutations which enhance Fc RIIIA and Fc RIIA binding reduce binding to Fc RIIB and enhance ADCC and or complement function Section 6.8 were cloned into the anti CD20 antibody RITUXIN anti CD20 antibody using standard techniques. These chimeric antibodies were expressed by transient transfection into 293H cells and purified over a protein G column. The variant antibodies were tested in an ADCC or CDC assay as described supra Section 6.10 and 6.11 respectively in cells isolated from RITUXAN treated patients.

During the course of phase I and phase II clinical trials of Rituximab lymphoma cells from biopsy specimens obtained from patients with B cell lymphoma prior to receiving the antibody were collected. Participating patients underwent surgical removal of a lymph node near the surface of the body. This was done using a local anesthetic. A portion of the tissue was analyzed by routine histopathology in the pathology lab. A portion of the lymph node was used to make a cell suspension for the in vitro studies.

Additionally pre and post treatment PBMC via leukapheresis in some of the patients were collected to study the effector cells and T cell immune response after Rituximab treatment. Peripheral blood T cells and effector cells were collected via leukapheresis from patients treated with Rituximab. Participating patients underwent leukapheresis before the Rituximab treatment and one month after completion of the treatment to collect the T lymphocytes and effector cells. The collected blood components were mixed with an anti coagulant ACD A as it was drawn to prevent clotting. The effector cells collected via leukapheresis were used to determine if effector cells of different Fc R genotypes mediate ADCC differently.

The results of the ADCC assays for the different Fc Engineered rituximab antibodies in six of the patients are shown in . Tables 28 and 29 provide a ranking of the effectiveness of the antibodies in six patients with 1 being the most effective for that patient and 11 being the least effective for that patient. A normal donor provided PBMC for this experiment. The genotype of the normal donor was heterozygous for the FcRIIIA 158V and FcRIIA 131R alleles. In most patients the Fc engineered rituximab antibodies showed an improvement over rituximab in ADCC activity.

As shown in rituximab has minimal ADCC killing activity as compared to the other engineered rituximab antibodies tested. Patient 1 fits our definition of a non responder i.e. is refractory to rituximab treatment . In contrast in patient 2 wild type rituximab shows some ADCC activity however all tested variants except 59 60 and 52 60 exhibited improved ADCC activity.

Efficacy of Fc engineered rituximab antibodies may be investigated in a mouse xenographic model nu nu mice female approximately 10 weeks old utilizing a B cell lymphoblastic tumor e.g. Ramos cell tumors. Ramos cells ATCC CRL 1596 are maintained in culture using RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum and glutamine at 37 C. and 5 CO. To increase tumorigenicity of the cell line Tumors are first initiated in female nude mice approximately 7 10 weeks old by subcutaneous injection of 1.7 10Ramos cells in a volume of 0.10 ml HBSS using a 1 cc syringe fitted with 25 g needle. All animals are manipulated in a laminar flow hood and all cages bedding food and water are autoclaved. Tumor cells are passaged by excising tumors and passing these through a 40 mesh screen cells are washed twice with 1 HBSS 50 ml by centrifugation 1300 RPM resuspended in 1 HBSS to 10 10cells ml and frozen at 70 C. until used.

The one passaged tumor cells from several frozen lots are thawed pelleted by centrifugation 1300 RPM washed twice with 1 HBSS and resuspended to approximately 2.0 10cells ml in HBSS. Mice in the study groups are injected with 0.10 ml of the cell suspension s.c. using a 1 cc syringe fitted with a 25 g needle injections are made on the animal s left side approximately mid region. Tumors will develop in approximately two weeks.

Study groups are assigned to separate study groups based on the creation of a comparable tumor size distribution in each group average tumor size expressed as a product of length x width of the tumor was approximately 80 mm . 200 mg of the Fc engineered rituximab antibodies is used for treatment. The groups are treated via tail vein injections using a 100 l Hamilton syringe fitted with a 25 g needle.

Fifteen patients having histologically documented relapsed non Hodgkins B cell lymphoma will be treated with Fc engineered rituximab in a clinical trial. Each patient will receive a single dose of antibody in a dose escalating study there will be three patients per dose 10 mg m 50 mg m 100 mg m 250 mg mand 500 mg mTreatment will be by i.v. infusion through an 0.22 micron in line filter with the antibody being diluted in a final volume of 250 cc or a maximal concentration of 1 mg ml of normal saline. Initial rate will be 50 cc hr for the first hour if no toxicity was seen dose rate will be escalated to a maximum of 200 cc hr.

Toxicity as indicated by the clinician will be judged on a range from none to fever to moderate two patients to severe one patient . Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes will be analyzed to determine inter alia the impact of the antibodies on T cells and B cells.
