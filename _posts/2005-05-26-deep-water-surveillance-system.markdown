title: Deep water surveillance system
abstract: An elongated optical fiber is vertically positioned within seawater in a deep-depth targeted zone by vertical suspension thereof from a floating buoy. Electrode sensor arrays are positioned in vertically spaced relation to each other on the optical fiber for generating warning signals in response to detection of hostile conditions. The warning signals are converted into signal data collected and transferred to a transmitter in the floating buoy from which the sensor arrays are suspended within the targeted zone positioned on the optical fiber. Such collected data signals are transmitted through an antenna within the floating buoy to locations above the seawater surface for surveillance purposes.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 11 151 182 filed May 26 2005 Navy Case No. 96 494 entitled UNDERWATER SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to surveillance and collection of data with respect to conditions within deep underwater targeted zones for signal transmission to locations above the seawater.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

Surveillance systems have been employed to detect hostile environments within underwater targeted zones involving use of magnetic and electric field sensing technologies. The underwater conditions to be detected by such surveillance involved corrosion related to electric current and electrically powered equipment on submarines surface ships and other underwater vehicles and ship hull materials. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to maximize detection of such underwater hostile conditions within deepwater targeted surveillance zones.

Pursuant to the present invention underwater surveillance of a deep water targeted zone within a body of seawater involves use of one or more electric field sensors deployed within the seawater by vertical suspension from a floating buoy. When a plurality of the field sensors are utilized they are arranged in vertically spaced relation to each other about a common optical fiber connected at its upper end by a motion isolator to the floating buoy. An electrically conductive metallic cladding covers the optical fiber exposed to the seawater along upper and lower electrode sensing sections thereof separated by an intermediate insulating electronic node section within which the metallic cladding is covered by a water resistant coating within an outer water insulating housing. The upper and lower electrode sensing sections of the sensor array when deployed and powered in response to closing of a water sensing switch feed input surveillance data signals to a wideband amplifier within the housing of the electronic node section from which low and high band frequency outputs are filtered and registered by threshold detectors for signal encoding before transfer to data transmitter circuitry within the floating buoy connected to a radio frequency signal transmitting antenna. Surveillance data derived from the signal data and collected from all of the electrode sensor arrays is transmitted by the antenna as warning signals to locations above the seawater level for evaluation thereat to determine the existence of hostile conditions within the targeted underwater zone so that factual measures may be taken to deal therewith.

Referring now to the drawing in detail illustrates a body of seawater within which underwater surveillance is to be performed by means of a plurality of field sensing arrays each one of which is generally referred to by reference numeral . The seawater has a depth greater than 300 meters much greater than the length of all of the field sensing arrays being utilized which are vertically suspended from a floating data transmitting module buoy projecting above a top seawater level surface . The sensing arrays suspended below the top most one the arrays underlying the buoy as shown in occupy relatively deep underwater target zone. Each of the vertically suspended sensing arrays may have a total length of 22 meters as denoted in and is positioned in vertically spaced relation to each other on one optical fiber suspended from the floating buoy by a motion isolator at the upper end of the optical fiber above the top most one of the sensing arrays .

Each of the sensing arrays includes an intermediate electronic node section located between upper and lower electrode node sections and of 1 meter length spaced apart by 20 meters so as to form a total length of 22 meters as shown in . A metallic cladding covers the optical fiber entirely within each of the arrays . The cladding is exposed to the seawater along the electrode sections and above and below an outer water resistant coating thereon within the electronic node section as shown in . An outer water insulting housing encloses data signal generating and transmitting circuitry within the node section . Optical communication is effected from the circuitry within the housing of the node section through the fiber extending to the floating buoy as hereinafter explained.

An information packet of collected signal data outputs from all of the arrays is retransmitted through their associated circuitries to the data transmitter module circuitry within the floating module buoy as diagrammed in . A microcontroller within the circuitry receives the collected data from the modulators and transmits it to an antenna and a GPS receiver for radio frequency transmission from the floating buoy . Such radio frequency transmission of the collected surveillance data information is adapted to be received within manned or unmanned air or seawater surface vehicles or by higher power signal data repeater facilities for transmission to a satellite. The collected surveillance data so received may then be routed as warning signals to a command center to determine the tactical situation.

It will be apparent from the foregoing description that various underwater seawater conditions within a deep water surveillance zone may be detected such as natural corrosion and cathodic protective conditions surrounding a sea vessel or its electrical machinery. Deep water surveillance coverage is provided by use of the electrode sensing sections and respectively associated with each of the arrays each having relatively small detection ranges. Use of the wideband amplifier within the circuitry having low noise and low operational power characteristics advantageously reduces noise costs and false alarms. The use of the optical fiber with the claddings to form the sensing electrode sections and associated with each of the sensing arrays advantageously accommodates operational interconnection thereof with the low noise wideband amplifier within each of the array node sections and the communication linkage between all of the arrays and common data transmitting facilities within the module floating buoy such as the circuitry for most thorough surveillance of targeted underwater zones.

As an alternative the electrode sections and along the exposed portions of the cladding would be covered by silver silver chloride coatings as shown in . Such coatings improved electrical contact between the seawater and the cladding in order to enhance detection.

Obviously other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
