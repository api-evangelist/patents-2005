Content management systems provide the capability of managing content including typically the ability to search a body of stored content for and retrieve particular content of interest. Additional functionality provided by a content management system may include without limitation tracking revisions versions review approvals distribution life cycle and retention policy information file name file type file creator application used to create owner and any other data and or metadata associated with stored content. In a typical content management system a request from a user to retrieve content such as a particular file version or other stored object results in the content management system obtaining the requested content from a content storage location e.g. a content server and providing the requested content to the user. Because the content management system has limited throughput this middleman role limits the performance of data delivery to and from the content server or other storage location. It would be beneficial to be able to utilize the advantages of a content management system without suffering the performance limitations the content management system can impose.

The invention can be implemented in numerous ways including as a process an apparatus a system a composition of matter a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network wherein program instructions are sent over optical or electronic communication links. In this specification these implementations or any other form that the invention may take may be referred to as techniques. A component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task includes both a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. In general the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention.

Providing direct access to distributed managed content is disclosed. In some embodiments a remote system sends to a content management system a request associated with particular content such as a request to retrieve and or store write particular content. Information required to respond to the request is obtained from a content system. A content locator based at least in part on the information obtained from the content system is provided to the remote system. The content locator enables the remote system to retrieve the requested content directly from a content system or directly write to a content system as applicable without the content first passing through the content management system. In some embodiments the information required to respond to the request includes for one or more of a plurality of content systems associated with the content with which the request is associated e.g. a plurality of content systems at which the content associated with the request is and or can be stored information required to respond to the request with data associated with that content system. In some embodiments the plurality of content systems includes the content system from which the information required to respond to the request was obtained and one or more alternate content systems. In some embodiments a preferred content system is selected and a content locator associated with just the selected content system is provided to the remote system. The selected content system is selected as the best to interact with the remote system based on criteria such as distance from the remote system available bandwidth for the given selected content system speed of access between the remote system and the selected content system or any other relevant metric. In some embodiments a plurality of content locators is provided each content locator usable by the remote system to perform with respect to the content through direct communication with a content system with which the content locator is associated an operation associated with the request. In some embodiments a prioritized list of content locators is provided with a content locator associated with a preferred content system being listed first and other content locators being listed in order based on their relative desirability as a content system to service the request.

Alternate content system is also connected to network . Content in alternate content system is managed by content management system and contains files objects metadata or other data that may or may not also be contained in content system . In some embodiments a copy of at least a portion of the content managed by content management system and or stored on content system is stored on alternate content system e.g. by mirroring content stored on content system and or another content store associated with content management system to alternate content system . In various embodiments content is mirrored to alternate content system periodically as changes to data store on content system occur and or as particular content and or updates are requested from alternate content system . In some embodiments alternate content system is one of a plurality of alternate content systems containing content managed by content management system . In various embodiments a content system is selected from among a plurality of content systems comprising content system alternate content system and or one or more other alternate content systems not shown in to service a particular request. In various embodiments a content system is selected to interact with remote system or determined to be preferred over one or more other content systems based on criteria such as one or more of the following distance from remote system bandwidth available for communication between remote system and the selected content system speed of access between remote system and the selected content system and or any other relevant metric. In some embodiments a locator or a prioritized list of locators e.g. a locator for each of two or more content systems capable of servicing the request usable to read content from or write store content to one or more content systems is provided to remote system by content management system based at least in part on information including for example candidate file s or object s location s distances from remote system of respective content systems bandwidth access to content system s and candidate file s or object s attributes e.g. encryption and or compression characteristics received from content system .

In some embodiments remote system is one of a plurality of hosts able to access content management system via network . In some embodiments content system and or alternate content system are implemented in one or more physical computer systems each of which includes one or more storage devices. In some embodiments content management system does not act as a middleman by obtaining requested content from content system or alternate content system and forwarding the content on to the remote system . Instead for at least some requests e.g. for objects larger than a threshold size the content management system is configured to obtain from the content system and content system is configured to provide data required by the content management system to form a URL or other identifier locator etc. to be provided by the content management system to the remote host to enable the remote host to obtain the requested content directly from content system connection not shown in and or alternate content system as applicable.

In some embodiments remote system spawns client to receive the content locator and or prioritized list of locators and obtain the content from the content system and or a first available one of the content systems associated with the respective locators in the prioritized list using the content locator. Client also handles errors picks up data transfers from where they left off after an interruption and retrieves content from a different e.g. backup secondary etc. content system if the original system is no longer available to transfer content. In addition client takes care of handshaking between the content management system and remote system as well as the content system and the remote system . Client manages the location that data is transferred to and from including the relevant folder locations the file and or object names how to display the folders and any differences required due to operating system conventions e.g. different naming protocols etc. . In some embodiments client handles a digital signature or other type of security that allows verification of the interaction between remote system and the content management system and between the between remote system and the content system. In various embodiments client handles compression or decompression and or encryption or decryption of the transferred content as appropriate. In some embodiments client reverts to the transfer of content through the content management system in the event that it is not possible for file structure access or any other reason to transfer content directly to or from the content system.

In some embodiments web interface communicates via the Internet and or one or more private and or public networks using communication interface . In some embodiments web interface includes a set of web tools and or web development components. In some embodiments web interface comprises a web application built using a web development tool or kit associated with content server interface . In some embodiments content server interface comprises a framework for managing content for web or other applications running on content management system . In some embodiments content server interface comprises classes of content management objects that web interface may be configured to invoke as required e.g. in a manner specified in an API application programming interface or other specification or definition to accomplish content management related tasks such as storing tracking finding retrieving associating metadata with and otherwise managing stored content. In some embodiments content system interface includes an API and or a library that provides an API to the content server. In some embodiments web interface and content server interface comprise software code executed by one or more processors associated with content management system .

Content system interface is connected to a content server or other content system through communication interface . In some embodiments content system interface communicates with the content server using communication interface and communication interface is omitted. In various embodiments content management system is implemented using multiple computer systems one computer system or any other appropriate hardware and software systems.

Accelerated content server is accessed directly from a network through communication interface so that files can be directly read from and written to content store by a content system. In some embodiments direct access of a content system by a remote system through a network improves performance by avoiding indirect data transfers through a content management system. In some embodiments a content management system manages content stored in a distributed e.g. at least partly redundant manner in content system and one or more other content system s e.g. by files or other stored objects are kept in appropriate states e.g. up to date copies of files are kept in the content system and alternate content system s tracking and controlling versions across content systems checking files in out etc. In various embodiments content system is implemented using multiple computer systems one computer system or any other appropriate hardware and software systems including data storage devices such as magnetic hard drives tape drives semiconductor memory devices optical data storage devices or any mass or other storage device.

In some embodiments metadata database contains metadata information about the content in content store and content in one or more alternate content stores. Examples of metadata include when and by whom documents were created modified edited reviewed and approved keywords related to documents version data routing and collaboration data date time the content was created modified etc. and data associating two or more stored objects with each other e.g. to create and manage a virtual document or object. In various embodiments metadata also include information about distances between remote systems and alternate content systems or any other relevant metric that may affect the selection or prioritized listing of alternate content systems that are interacted with by a remote system in response to a content request. In various embodiments keywords in metadata database are entered by the creator editor modifier or approver of the document or by an automatic process or engine that scans the document to extract or identify relevant keywords such as by using natural language or other linguistic technologies to identify key concepts based on the words comprising the document.

In some embodiments content server maintains a file system or other hierarchical organization or view of content in content store and accelerated content server has no file system of its own and instead uses the file system of content server to read write content from to content store . In some embodiments accelerated content server comprises a web server.

In some embodiments content server has information regarding files documents or objects that have been transferred out of content store and or alternate content stores i.e. objects that have been checked out for editing or other use by a user enabling management of requests for content. In some embodiments a content management system associated with the content server keeps track of which objects have been checked out. In some such embodiments a subsequent request to the content management system to retrieve an object that has been checked out and has not yet been checked back in is denied e.g. by sending a reply indicating the content is not currently available is checked out to a user identified in the reply etc.

Accelerated content server is also accessed directly from a network through communication interface so that files can be directly read from and written to alternate content store by a content management system. In some embodiments direct access of alternate content system by a remote system through a network improves performance by avoiding indirect data transfers through a content management system where alternate content system is managed by a content management system so that content in content system and one or more alternate content systems are kept in appropriate states e.g. up to date copies of files are kept in the content system and alternate content system s . In various embodiments alternate content system is implemented using multiple computer systems one computer system or any other appropriate hardware and software systems including data storage devices such as magnetic hard drives tape drives semiconductor memory devices optical data storage devices or any mass or other storage device.

In some embodiments accelerated content server maintains a file system or other hierarchical organization or view of content in alternate content store . In some embodiments alternate content system also includes a content server and accelerated content server has no file system of its own and instead uses the file system of the content server to read write content from to alternate content store . In some embodiments accelerated content server comprises a web server.
