Media gateways and other switching apparatus employed to switch TDM other types of data in a circuit switched network are often designed for specific needs particular known or projected traffic demands of one or more PSTN networks. However it is not altogether uncommon that the traffic demands and or other parameters employed to determine size capability and performance of the switching apparatus can far exceed known and even projected traffic patterns.

Consequently attempts have been made to design media gateways and other switching apparatus which are expandable permitting reconfiguration as needed within a particular application or installation. However such expandable apparatus are invariably blocking apparatus thereby limiting the utility of some percentage of the apparatus interfaces to the connected network s . Moreover the installation maintenance and reconfiguration of these previous attempts at providing expandable switching apparatus have proven to be cost time and labor intensive.

The following is at least a partial list of the acronyms that appear in the present disclosure. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the terms corresponding to each of the acronyms listed below may vary within the art within the embodiments explicitly described herein and within other embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure. Those skilled in the art will also understand that aspects of the present disclosure are not limited to applications pertaining specifically to any one or more of the following acronyms. Acronyms not listed below but otherwise mentioned or discussed herein should be recognized and understood by those skilled in the pertinent art within the context of the present disclosure. In the event that an acronym is employed in the present disclosure in a manner inconsistent with its usage in the art the scope of the present disclosure is intended to include both the ordinary usage in the art and the specific usage herein.

It is to be understood that the following disclosure provides many different embodiments or examples for implementing different features of various embodiments. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are of course merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. In addition the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and or configurations discussed.

Referring to illustrated is a schematic view of at least a portion of one embodiment of an apparatus according to aspects of the present disclosure. The apparatus may include be or be employed with a media gateway and or a softswitch. Although not limited within the scope of the present disclosure the media gateway may include be or be employed with one or more switches and or other switching fabric components IP gateways and or other gateways channel banks and or other devices. The media gateway may convert data from a format protocol and or type required for one network to another format protocol and or type required for another network and or otherwise convert data from a first type of data on a first transmission link to a second type of data on a second transmission link. The media gateway may terminate channels from a circuit switched network and pass streaming media for a packet switched network such as RTP streams in an IP network. Input data for the media gateway may include audio video and or T.120 real time multi point communications among others which the media gateway may handle simultaneously or otherwise. In one embodiment the media gateway may primarily or only serve a PSTN network but may be reconfigurable to also serve other networks.

As employed herein a network may refer to an entire network or to a network portion a network application and or network apparatus. To that end one or more instances of the apparatus or components thereof or other embodiments of the apparatus within the scope of the present disclosure may be singularly or collectively employed to bridge two or more networks including those of PSTNs among others. PSTN networks may employ TDM and or PCM among other non packet formats and or protocols.

The apparatus includes a variable number X of switching apparatus each of which may be a switching device or sub system of a corresponding one of X media gateways. In the illustrated embodiment the number X equals four 4 . However the number X may vary within the scope of the present application such as according to aspects described below. In general the apparatus may be functional regardless of the value of the number X including if the number X equals one 1 although benefits of certain aspects of the present disclosure may become more appreciable for embodiments in which the number X equals two 2 or more.

Each switching apparatus includes a backplane by which a number of PCM streams or other TDM or non packet communications are delivered from a number of network interfaces to an independent switching matrix . Each independent switching matrix may be an N N time slot interchange TSI having N ingress ports and N egress ports where the number N equals two 2 or more. However aspects of the present disclosure may also be applicable to embodiments in which the independent switching matrix has a different number of ingress and egress ports. For example the number of ingress ports may be a multiple of the number of egress ports such as where the number of ingress ports is two 2 times three 3 times or four 4 times the number of egress ports.

The number N may also vary within the scope of the present application such as according to aspects described below. In general the apparatus may be functional regardless of the value of the number N including if the number N equals two 2 although benefits of certain aspects of the present disclosure may become more appreciable for embodiments in which the number N equals two 2 or more. For example the number N may be four 4 eight 8 sixteen 16 thirty two 32 or sixty four 64 among other values. In one embodiment the number N may be equal to a higher power of two 2 such as 128 or 256. The number N may also be equal to a number of DS0s transmissions links or network interfaces corresponding to or integral to each switching apparatus and or may be equal to the maximum number of PCM streams deliverable from the backplane to the independent switching matrix including in non blocking configurations.

The discussion that follows may refer to the number X as the number of switching apparatus in the apparatus and may refer to the number N as the number of DS0s of one of the switching apparatus unless otherwise indicated. However this convention is employed merely for the sake of simplicity clarity and ease of description and should in no way be considered a limitation to the scope of the present disclosure.

Each switching apparatus also includes a distributor which may sometimes be referred to as a fan out. Within each switching apparatus the PCM streams delivered to the independent switching matrix from the backplane are also delivered to the distributor . The distributor is configured to copy each of the PCM streams received at a switching apparatus to one or more of the other switching apparatus . For example as in the embodiment depicted in the distributor transmits each of the PCM streams to each of the other X 1 switching apparatus via a completely meshed arrangement of switching expansion interconnects . However embodiments other than complete meshing are also within the scope of the present disclosure such that one or more of the X switching apparatus may not be connected to one or more of the other X 1 switching apparatus . For example each of the X switching apparatus may only be connected to the one or two nearest ones of the other X 1 switching apparatus e.g. nearest spatially .

One or more of the switching expansion interconnects may each be an intergateway trunk such as a bundle of optical fibers copper wires and or other digital communication mediums. One or more of the switching expansion interconnects may also be or comprise one or more interconnects traces or other electrical conductors located on or integral to a circuit board connected to or otherwise associated with the backplane such as where two or more of the switching apparatus may be interconnected by their connection to the backplane resulting from their installation into a common chassis. One or more of the switching expansion interconnects may also be a jumper or patch cord or other relatively short length wire or fiber possibly having modular or standard connectors for coupling to the backplane and or directly to the switching apparatus .

Each switching apparatus also includes an expansion switching matrix and a collector which may sometimes be referred to as a fan in. Each expansion switching matrix may be or include a TSI and may thus be referred to as an expansion TSI.

Within each switching apparatus the PCM streams distributed by each of the other X 1 switching apparatus if completely meshed are received by the collector and forwarded to the expansion switching matrix . Each expansion switching matrix may be an M N TSI having M ingress ports and N egress ports where the number M equals the product of X 1 and N e.g. in a completely meshed arrangement of all of the switching apparatus . However aspects of the present disclosure may also be applicable to embodiments in which the expansion switching matrix has a different number of ingress ports and or a different number of egress ports. For example the number M of ingress ports may be any multiple of the number of egress ports or may equal the product of X P and N where the number P is some integer or fractional number other than the number one 1 .

Each switching apparatus also includes a mux which may sometimes be referred to as a multiplexer. Within each switching apparatus the mux is configured to perform a per time slot multiplexing of the PCM streams received from the independent switching matrix and the expansion switching matrix . The multiplexed stream from the mux is returned to the backplane such as for delivery to the one or more PSTN or other networks connected to the apparatus .

Aspects of many embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure such as the embodiment shown in may provide an expandable switching apparatus demonstrating a technique for coupling multiple media gateways or other switching apparatus in a non blocking uncomplicated affordable and or reliable manner. Those skilled in the art will understand that the term non blocking may refer to a switching apparatus having N network interfaces DS0s and capable of N 2 connections. Non blocking can also indicate that any communication arriving at one of the N network interfaces can be connected to any other of the N network interfaces regardless of the number of other N network interfaces currently involved in a communications session. However other aspects of the term non blocking may also be applicable within the context of the present disclosure. Nonetheless aspects of some embodiments of the present disclosure may permit the expansion of a media gateway or other switching component of a network such as may be necessary in response to an increased demand on the network.

For example one such network may include the apparatus of as a media gateway or a media gateway portion . However over time the demand on the network may exceed the bandwidth and or other performance metrics of the apparatus . Consequently an additional switching apparatus may be added to the apparatus . The additional switching apparatus may be connected to each of other switching apparatus if a completely meshed arrangement is employed. In this manner a number N of additional network interfaces DS0s may be added to the apparatus and these additional network interfaces can be implemented while maintaining a non blocking configuration.

Referring to illustrated is a schematic view of at least a portion of one of the switching apparatus shown in . As in the switching apparatus shown in includes a backplane from which a number N of PCM streams are delivered to an independent switching matrix and a distributor . The distributor is configured to fan out the N PCM streams to each of X 1 switching apparatus shown in and the apparatus also includes a collector configured to receive N PCM streams from each of the other X 1 switching apparatus which and then switched by an expansion switching matrix to a mux for delivery back to the backplane .

As described above the performance and or capability of the apparatus of may be increased by interconnecting one or more additional instances of the switching apparatus . However the performance and or capability of the apparatus of may alternatively or additionally be increased by altering one of more of the existing instances of the switching apparatus . That is switching apparatus other than the switching apparatus may be added to increase performance and or capability of an existing operating instance of the apparatus or the apparatus such that a first number of data streams may be switched prior to the expansion and a greater number of data streams may be switched after the expansion. As described below the additional switching apparatus which may be employed to expand performance and or capability of an existing switching apparatus may merely comprise adding for example an additional TSI. Nonetheless whether the performance and or capability expansion involves additional instances of the apparatus and or additional instances of a TSI or other switching apparatus the expanded number of switching apparatus and or network interfaces after the expansion can include the switching apparatus and or network interfaces that were operational prior to the expansion.

Moreover this configurable nature of some embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure may similarly be utilized to decrease performance and or capability such as by decreasing the number of switching apparatus that are interconnected within the apparatus or by decreasing the number of TSIs within one or more switching apparatus . The configurable aspects of the apparatus and of are also not necessarily limited to those described below.

The additional PCM streams received by the additional collector are delivered to an additional expansion switching matrix . The switching apparatus also includes an additional mux configured to multiplex the PCM streams switched by the expansion switching matrices and . The mux may then multiplex the output of the mux with the data switched by the independent switching matrix which may then be delivered to the backplane for delivery to the PSTN or other network connected to the switching apparatus or connected to the apparatus comprising the switching apparatus .
