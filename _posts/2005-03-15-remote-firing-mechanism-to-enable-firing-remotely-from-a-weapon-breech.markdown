title: Remote firing mechanism to enable firing remotely from a weapon breech
abstract: A remote firing mechanism enables an operator to fire a weapon remotely, from a position other than from behind the breech, in order to minimize firing hazards to the operator. The remote firing mechanism is secured to a carrier assembly mounted on, or near the breech, for enabling an operator to fire the weapon from the right side of the weapon. The carrier assembly includes a connector secured to a linkage mechanism of the remote firing mechanism. In turn, the linkage mechanism is connected to a lanyard that enables the operator to initiate the firing operation. The linkage mechanism and the lanyard are positioned remotely from the breech.

The present invention relates in general to weapon firing safety. More particularly the present invention relates to remote firing of munitions and an associated remote firing mechanism RFM that enables firing from one side of a weapon.

The safety of the soldiers in the field is high on the priorities of weapons design. Not only are soldiers constantly exposed to enemy fire and a hostile environment during battlefield engagement they are also exposed to the firing hazards of their own weapons and launch equipment. Often times the launch equipment and munitions may be worn out or become unsafe due to intense use operator error improper maintenance or poor weather conditions resulting in an increase of potential hazards to the soldiers. It is therefore an important goal to minimize the potential hazards to soldiers operating weapons in the field despite such real world adverse conditions.

In one conventional design of an artillery gun the recoil buffering mechanism for the artillery gun comprises a breech assembly and a barrel wherein the barrel and breech do not provide any special safety design for the operator standing behind the breech to fire the artillery gun. This configuration leaves the operator fully exposed to the dangers of explosives and hot combustion gases leaking from the gun in case the breech accidentally opens during the gun firing.

More specifically when the breech is in an open position the munition is loaded axially into the firing chamber. To perform this operation the operator positions himself or herself at a distance from the breech. Next the breech is closed in preparation for firing. Since the firing event is accomplished almost instantaneously the operator remains at the distal position behind the breech during the entire firing operation.

A significant pressure rise results from firing the munition. It is necessary for the breech to remain safely closed during the firing in order to impart the maximum forward momentum to the projectile and to prevent any of the explosives and hot combustion gases from leaking past the breech to cause harm to the operator along the leakage path.

However due to wear debris or other unforeseen factors the breech might not be fully closed prior to or during the firing of the weapon resulting in leakage of explosives and hot combustion gases from the barrel to a position distal to the breech where the operator is positioned. This exposure increases the hazard of the operator and could pose substantial danger to operator safety.

In one embodiment of a safety and arming mechanism for a rifled gun the mechanism is controlled by three projectile parameters. The first and second parameters are the axial and angular accelerations of the fired projectile which move a setback ball to arm the mechanism. The third projectile parameter i.e. angular velocity is utilized to lock the setback ball in the armed position. As the projectile continues its flight it only becomes armed when a spin actuated escapement mechanism is moved to a fully armed position. In addition a command arm signal is required to release the arrangement such that the escapement mechanism is in a condition to complete its motion to the fully armed position.

Such weapon arming safety design is implemented in the munition only and not in the launch equipment. It does not explicitly address safety against explosive hazards or firing hazards at the point of firing in case a catastrophic failure occurs as in the case of firing artillery rounds and the breech suddenly becoming loosened from the closed position leaking explosives and hot combustion gases behind the breech.

Another conventional safety and arming device is based on micro electromechanical system MEMS . Two independent mechanical locks are moved out of the way to allow the arming slider to remove a barrier in the explosive train to arm a fuze or close a switch for firing. The mechanical locks respond only to valid launch or deployment conditions. In addition the mechanism does not explicitly address safety against explosive hazards at the point of firing in case a catastrophic failure occurs.

In yet another conventional device a projectile is launched with on board linear acceleration sensors to measure at least two accelerations and the recorded time interval between the two accelerations would need to fall within a pre determined range in order to arm the munition for detonation. This device assures the safety of arming the munition as long as the launched projectile achieves target values in flight parameters. When this goal is not achieved the munition in flight would not be allowed to detonate. However this device deals with the safety to arm the projectile after becoming airborne and not with the safety of the weapon system during the firing process to protect the weapon operators.

In still another embodiment a firearm safety locking mechanism prevents accidental or unauthorized use of the weapon. The safety locking mechanism is placed and operates in the firing chamber or in the barrel of the weapon. One of the goals of this mechanism is to prevent accidental use by an under aged operator. However such mechanism does not address the firing hazard reduction in case the firing chamber fails to hold the hot explosive gases in place inside the weapon.

Although these conventional technologies have proven to be useful the issue of safety at the point of firing has not been addressed and it would be desirable to present additional improvements to further reduce firing hazard. What is needed is an artillery gun equipped with a breech having a mechanism to safeguard against premature firing of munitions before the breech is fully closed. The safety mechanism should prevent explosives and hot combustion gases from the primer and the charge from quickly leaking from the firing chamber past the breech and subjecting to harm any personnel in the path of leakage. The need for such a safety mechanism has heretofore remained unsatisfied.

The present invention satisfies this need and presents a safety mechanism also referred to herein as the mechanism or the present mechanism for safeguard against premature firing of munitions before the breech is fully closed. In the event that explosives and hot combustion gases from the primer and the charge quickly leak from the firing chamber past the breech the mechanism minimizes the firing hazard to any personnel in the path of the leakage.

The present invention reduces the firing hazard of personnel operating in the vicinity of weapons and in particular it reduces the firing hazard of personnel firing munitions from behind the breech of the weapon.

One feature of the present invention is to reduce the firing hazard to the operator when the breech does not remain fully closed during the firing of munitions in an artillery gun with explosives and hot combustion gases leaking from the firing chamber past the breech to behind the weapon.

In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the artillery gun is fitted with a remote firing mechanism RFM and a safety latch assembly that are positioned on the artillery gun .

The remote firing mechanism enables the operator to fire the artillery gun from a position other than behind the breech . The operator s position is preferably on the right of the gun barrel . In the event that the breech does not remain fully closed during the firing explosives and hot combustion gases leaking out past the breech do not cause potential harm to the operator whose position is farther away from the harmful burst of materials.

In this particular exemplary embodiment the remote firing mechanism is disposed so that firing could take place from the right side of the artillery gun . With the operator standing on the right side of the artillery gun the remote firing mechanism and the associated linkage mechanism provide the necessary linkage to actuate a connector on the carrier assembly in order to initiate the firing sequence.

The carrier assembly is secured to the artillery gun and includes a housing . The housing pivots around an axis of rotation X X. The pivot axis X X lies orthogonally to the axis of the gun barrel and is substantially parallel to the ground level on which the artillery gun stands.

The remote firing mechanism comprises a base a shaft a spring a connector a lower link that terminates at rotation points an upper link that terminates in a shoulder and a return point .

The connector is positioned at the proximal end of the base and is tied or coupled to the linkage mechanism which in turn is controlled by an operator via a cable or lanyard . The linkage mechanism is shown as a block and is comprised of a series of linkages and springs and that is connected to the connector by means of a tie . The lanyard is connected to the linkage mechanism for the operator s use.

The forward pivot pin is mounted on the upper surface of base behind the connector . The forward pivot pin provides pivotal support for a longitudinal bar referred to as the upper link on the upper surface of base . The upper link extends beyond the distal end of the base and terminates in a block having a raised upper surface . The upper link is spring biased towards the housing by means of an underlying spring mounted on the shaft that is secured to the housing .

On each side of the upper link a longitudinal lower link comprising two simultaneous side members is attached to the upper link by means of the rear pivot that has its axis of rotation perpendicular to the axis of the gun barrel . The lower link is spring biased to adopt a downward slanting angle towards the distal end of the base .

The safety latch assembly comprises a latch body a left protruding latch hook a support shaft with a biasing torsion spring a straight headless right pin under counterclockwise bias and a left pin that is lockable with a firing mechanism tray s circular rack .

The latch body of the safety latch assembly is mounted onto a tray latch support shaft that is biased counterclockwise by the torsion spring . The torsion spring wraps around the support shaft and has two extensions whose interior angle is defined by a straight headless pin on the right side and another pin on the left side both mounted onto the latch body . The latch body terminates on the left with a latch hook whose hook faces the breech on the distal end of the artillery gun .

The operation of the remote firing mechanism will now be explained in connection with . The operator opens the breech to load the munition or cartridge into the artillery gun s firing chamber closes the breech safely against the firing chamber and takes a position on the right side of the gun barrel. Next the operator pulls on a cable or lanyard . The lanyard is connected to the linkage mechanism which in turn pulls on the connector of the remote firing mechanism in the direction of arrow A . This action results in pulling the upper link upward in the direction of arrow B to compress a spring for releasing the plunger to push the firing pin forward in order to fire the primer on the munition or cartridge in the firing chamber.

In this embodiment the remote firing mechanism and the linkage mechanism enable the operator to fire the weapon remotely that is from a position other than behind the breech. Once the weapon is fired the weapon returns it to its battery position. The breech opens up for loading a new munition or cartridge into the firing chamber. As it will be explained later in more detail in connection with the safety latch assembly rotates counterclockwise to place a latch hook in order to lock a firing mechanism tray and to prevent it from moving forward to launch a plunger into the firing pin for the primer.

The unlocked position of the safety latch assembly corresponds to the breech in a safely closed position against the firing chamber in the artillery gun . The breech drives the circular rack to rotate clockwise so that the left pin of the safety latch assembly locks on a matching gear surface of the linear rack due to the counterclockwise spring bias on the safety latch assembly .

The pin is pushed to rotate clockwise around the tray latch shaft by means of the linear rack to a position further from the circular rack. Correspondingly the latch hook of the safety latch assembly rotates clockwise to a position outside the traveling carriage of the firing mechanism tray freeing the firing mechanism tray to move forward.

The operation of the safety latch assembly allows firing the munition only after the breech is safely closed onto the firing chamber of the artillery gun . The safety latch assembly prevents premature firing of the primer if the breech is not safely closed due for example to malfunction. Its operation is mechanically driven by a series of steps and the operational progression is determined by individual timing of each step. This design lends itself to completely manual semi automatic or automatic firing operation.

In the unlocked position the firing mechanism tray carrying a firing pin to fire the primer slides forward being driven by a plunger assembly that carries the plunger . Upon command to fire the axially aligned plunger launches forward to hit the firing pin driving it into the primer to set off the charge and fire the munition or round in the artillery gun .

The firing mechanism tray and the plunger assembly with a rotating turret onto which the plunger is mounted travel axially towards the gun barrel via a precise recess imbedded in the carrier assembly guided by the linear track .

When the safety latch assembly is in this distal position the spring biased safety latch assembly is free to rotate counterclockwise for the latch tip to engage and lock the firing mechanism tray . The firing pin is spring retracted distally towards the breech and the plunger is retracted. These steps ensure that the primer of the munition is not prematurely fired before the breech is again safely closed against the firing chamber of the gun barrel .

It is to be understood that the specific embodiments of the invention that have been described are merely illustrative of certain applications of the principle of the present invention. Numerous modifications may be made to the remote firing mechanism and safety locking assembly described herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
