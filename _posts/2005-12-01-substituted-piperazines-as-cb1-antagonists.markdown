Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of the invention are also contemplated herein. The term prodrug as employed herein denotes a compound that is a drug precursor which upon administration to a subject undergoes chemical conversion by metabolic or chemical processes to yield a compound of formula I or a salt and or solvate thereof. A discussion of prodrugs is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella 1987 Volume 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series and in 1987 Edward B. Roche ed. American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press both of which are incorporated herein by reference thereto.

 Solvate means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding including hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. Solvate encompasses both solution phase and isolatable solvates. Non limiting examples of suitable solvates include ethanolates methanolates and the like. Hydrate is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is HO.

One or more compounds of the present invention may also exist as or optionally be converted to a solvate. The preparation of solvates is generally known. Thus for example M. Caira et al 93 3 601 611 2004 describe the preparation of the solvates of the antifungal fluconazole in ethyl acetate as well as from water. Similar preparations of solvates hemisolvate hydrates and the like are described by E. C. van Tonder et al 5 1 article 12 2004 and A. L. Bingham et al 603 604 2001 . A typical non limiting process involves dissolving the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired solvent organic or water or mixtures thereof at a higher than ambient temperature and cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals which are then isolated by standard methods. Analytical techniques such as for example 1. R. spectroscopy show the presence of the solvent or water in the crystals as a solvate or hydrate .

The compounds of Formula I form salts that are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of Formula I herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof unless otherwise indicated. The term salt s as employed herein denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and or organic acids as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and or organic bases. In addition when a compound of Formula I contains both a basic moiety such as but not limited to a piperazine and an acidic moiety such as but not limited to a carboxylic acid zwitterions inner salts may be formed and are included within the term salt s as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable i.e. non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred although other salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the Formula I may be formed for example by reacting a compound of Formula I with an amount of acid or base such as an equivalent amount in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization. Acids and bases which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic or acidic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed for example by S. Berge et al 1977 66 1 1 19 P. Gould 1986 33 201 217 Anderson et al 1996 Academic Press New York in Food Drug Administration Washington D.C. on their website and P. Heinrich Stahl Camille G.

Competition binding assays for cannabinoid CBand CBaffinity were performed by incubating commercially purchased membranes prepared from cells expressing each receptor subtype 8 g pro with 0.5 nM H CP55 940 a non selective cannabinoid agonist along with concentrations of drug ranging from 0.0001 3 M in Buffer A 5 mM MgCl 2.5 mM EDTA and 013 BSA . Non specific binding was defined in the presence of 10 M CP55 940.

The functional efficacy of compounds to activate second messengers within the cell was determined utilizing the GTP S binding assay. Guanine nucleotides are phosphorylated within the plasma membrane of the cell following binding and activation by agonists. A radiolabelled derivative of guanine triphosphate GTP is utilized in this assay as it cannot be dephosphorylated and therefore accumulates following agonist binding. The simultaneous presence of an antagonist into this system will shift the agonist concentration curve to the right with increasing concentrations of antagonist producing a greater rightward shift in the dose response curve of the agonist.

Commercially purchased membranes were incubated with 10 mM GDP to allow sufficient substrate for phosphorylation in the presence of agonist. The membranes were then pre incubated with increasing concentrations of test compound for 30 minutes to determine if they were capable of stimulating phosphorylation alone. Increasing concentrations of the non selective cannabinoid agonist WIN55 122 were then added in the presence or absence of each concentration of test compound. The assay was then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. To complete the assay S GTP S was added and the assay incubated for another 30 minutes. Assays were terminated by rapid filtration onto 10 mM sodium phosphate treated GF C filterplates using a Brandel cell harvester. The plates were dried and Microscint scintillation cocktail was added after which the bound radioactivity was quantified using a Topcount scintillation counter.

The stimulation of S GTP S binding as a function of the concentration of the agonist WIN55 122 in the absence and presence of test compound was plotted and the ECdetermined by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. A Schild analysis of the rightward shift in the dose response curve of WIN55 122 in the presence of test compound was determined by plotting the concentration of test compound against the negative log of the dose ratio 1 ECagonist test compound EC50 of agonist alone . A linear regression analysis yields the Kb defined as the X intercept of the linear equation.
