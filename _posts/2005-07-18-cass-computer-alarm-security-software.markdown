title: CASS (computer alarm security software)
abstract: The software configurations of a personal computer allow it to provide portable home security to poor American families and small business owners. When a security breach is detected, a wave file out of the computer speakers serves as a detection alarm to the intruder, while another wave file serves as a notification to the homeowner. The personal computer program would automatically loop through different telephone numbers, as preset. The homeowner has the responsibilities to stop, reset or dispatch the appropriate authorities base on the nature of the notification.

Many security companies require that you buy the basic security system package first. Something that ranges approximately from 450 dollars up to 30000 dollars or so it all depends on what you want to secure and the size of the area that will be covered.

Soon after you owned the security package the security company starts charging you a monthly payment for monitoring. As soon as you stop paying the monthly payment you no longer have security. You end up with multiple boxes holes many sensors dedicated video cameras and wires that run all over your house walls that do nothing. You lost all deposits fees and initial basic package investment. Such unfair system frustrates many American families particularly the poor middle class families and small business owners.

Security companies make use of a variety of security equipment such as dedicated video cameras motion detectors vibration sensors pressure sensors heat sensors warning sirens equipment dedicated Network Interface Devices NID and telecommunication network equipment. Too many dedicated electronic hardware render the security system expensive and completely non portable. If the subscriber needs to move to another house he she has to pay for new installation fees.

According to the National Burglar Fire Alarm Association NBFAA each year there are more than 2 million burglaries in the U.S. Not taking precautions against crimes and burglaries can have painful consequences not only on American families but also our children as well as the future of the American society. The American government cannot protect every American citizen against crimes and burglaries. As a result poor American families who do not own a security system are left alone in the battle against crimes.

Many middle classes and poor American families are well aware of the risks that involve living without the minimum home security system possible. However they cannot afford the cost of home security system on the market today. The minimum security coverage on the market today requires many payments in advance such as packages and installation fees as well as a monthly payment of approximately 75 dollars and up. Poor and middle classes American families accept to run the risk of living many painful moments of crimes against their love ones only because they cannot afford today s high cost of home security.

Security equipment such as motion detectors heat sensors and the like are not perfect. Base on the nature of those electronic sensors they sometimes false triggering. When a motion sensor false triggering the end result is a false alarm notification signal. Security companies do not know how to eliminate false alarms in their security systems therefore when a security breach occurs they rely on their customers for information on the nature of the alarm.

Security companies unfairly charge their customers extra security fees due to false alarms. Very often the customer has nothing to do with that. The position of a motion sensor as well as temperature variations could cause security equipment to false triggering. There are a number of variables that could cause a sensor to false triggering. Most often such parameters are not related to the customer at all. Charging the customer a high fee for false notifications is obviously unfair.

Security companies developed a verification protocol consisting of calling the subscriber s home telephone number to ask questions about the notification signal. They are hopping to find someone to give them a clue on the nature of the security breach. They often provide the customer a security password that they ask for. If the provided password were correct they would cancel the dispatch of security personnel. On the other hand if the code provided were not correct they would dispatch the appropriate security personnel. Desperate with the problem of false alarms security companies keep in their database names and telephone numbers of friends and neighbors of their subscribers.

The average American who is willing to protect his her family is paying too much for basic home security. Package costs as well as the monthly payment for monitoring are not affordable. The invention of Computer Alarm Security System CASS tackles the problem of insecurity in America and may have found a solution to the problem of home base insecurity in America.

Because the problem is due to high costs of security the primary vision is to create an affordable security system for small businesses and poor American families. This predicament was approached at many different angles.

My brother and I the present inventors spent everything we own into researching how to implement an inexpensive security system. Despite all nothing has been found. Fortunately our vision is too strong to allow us to quit. My brother and I the present inventors have decided to transform the personal computer into an effective home security apparatus. The idea is anyone who already owns a computer can afford home security. After many years of researches the dream comes true. My brother and I the present inventors have developed the Computer Alarm Security System CASS . CASS can be the most affordable home security system today.

My brother and I the present inventors dream to see every computer in the U. S comes preloaded with the CASS software and build in motion detector direct from the manufacturer. So computer owners will only have to own a computer to be in possession of an operable home security system that they can use at not extra cost. What a revolution that would be in the area of personal and home security. Because the Computer Alarm Security System CASS is completely portable travelers can carry their laptop computers as a monitoring security apparatus anywhere.

The innovation of the present invention is to use the customer s own personal computer as the center of the security system. This realization transfers control from the security company to the consumer. The owner of the Computer Alarm Security System CASS becomes the owner of his her own security company therefore all unfair fees are eliminated. The evolution of the Computer Alarm Security System CASS will force the majority of security companies to treat their customers fairly.

Using the personal computer as the center of the security system Computer Alarm Security System CASS eliminates unnecessary and expensive hardware equipment. The personal computer comes with all that is needed to provide security therefore if the customer already has a computer he she can install the software and the necessary sensors to create his her own basic security system.

There are a number of hardware security devices on the market that have little similarities with the Computer Alarm Security System. Unfortunately those devices are security boxes therefore the customer has to buy the sensors and the box. They are very static in their functionalities and they are not software upgradeable.

Because the Computer Alarm Security System CASS uses a personal computer as the center of security its functionalities are obviously unlimited. The Computer Alarm Security System CASS could be upgrade with new functionalities in a flash. Armed with Internet technology the customer can download new functionalities from the vendor s web site.

Further objects and advantages will become apparent from a consideration of the detailed description and drawings.

In accordance with the present invention the customer s own personal computer is transformed into an effective security system. Therefore the invention makes it possible for any individual who already owns an operable personal computer to be in possession of a completely portable and software upgradeable security system. The only requirement involves is to have the Computer Alarm Security System Software legally installed.

Soon after the software configurations of the Computer Alarm Security System CASS security is built around the customer s personal computer using the least security equipment sensor . The sensor is connected to the serial port connector of the personal computer via a cable . The cable is designed to transmit RS232 protocol from the sensor to the personal computer . The customer must at least have one sensor connected to the serial port .

When a security breach is detected communication between the sensor and the personal computer is established. A telephone call is placed within the modem output jack through the modem line through the phone jack . The telephone call is directed to one of the telephone numbers that the customer set during the configurations of the Computer Alarm Security System CASS Software. It is very significant to know that the telephone numbers are not hard coded into the Computer Alarm Security System CASS software. The customer can choose any telephone number right out of the top of his her head. In this embodiment we are assuming that the customer set his her telephone number as the number to be called.

After the telephone call is placed on the modem line an alarmed sound is sent to both the right speaker and the left speaker of the personal computer . The sound file creates the alarmed sound effects indicating to the intruder that he she has been detected and he she has to leave the premises immediately.

While the alarmed sound is playing the customer s telephone would ring. If the customer s personal computer were equipped with voice modem as he she answers a voice sound would indicate the nature of the call. However if the customer s personal computer is only equipped with data fax modem a DTMF warning sound would indicate the nature of the call.

The Computer Alarm Security System CASS software is implemented to call one of the configured telephone numbers as many times as the customer desires until an of hook signal is detected. If the customer does not pick up the phone the Computer Alarm Security System CASS software would redirect the call.

After listening to the message the customer has the option to stop the preset number of calls prematurely by entering a security code from his her telephone keypad. Again the security code is not hard code within the Computer Alarm Security System CASS software the security code could be any desired combination of digits started from 0 to 9. The security code can be used to reset the Computer Alarm Security System CASS .

The representation in shows the use of a wireless speaker system . Everything in the Computer Alarm Security System CASS works the same as . The only advantage of the wireless speaker system is that it frees the speaker from the personal computer . This advantage permits the customer to be able to hind the speaker system from the intruder. The alarmed sound file is transmitted from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna to the speaker .

Looking at both the sensor and the speaker are wireless. This semi wireless configuration of the Computer Alarm Security System CASS offers remarkable flexibilities where the personal computer could be remotely operated. At the moment of a security breach the RS232 protocol between the sensor and the personal computer is transmitted via radio frequency from the sensor s transmitting antenna to the sensor s receiving antenna . The alarmed sound file is transmitted from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna to the speaker .

Refer to Jan. 1 1997 not only both the sensor and the speaker are wireless the modem is also wireless. This fully wireless configuration operates the same as however it offers the remarkable flexibilities. This configuration frees the personal computer completely from all wire connections and offers the remarkable flexibility of a mobile home security system.
