title: Artemisinins with improved stability and bioavailability for therapeutic drug development and application
abstract: A stable form of artemisinin wherein an artelinic acid or artesunic acid is complexed with cyclodextrin analogs, preferably, Î²-cyclodextrin. The complexed cyclodextrin artemisinin formulation shields the peroxide portion of the artemisinin backbone from hydrolytic decomposition rendering it stable in solution. Artelinic acid and cyclodextrin are placed into contact with one another to yield a 2:1 molecular species. Artesunic acid and cyclodextrin yield a 1:1 molecular species. The complexed cyclodextrin artemisinin formulation is effective for the treatment of malaria and is stable in solution for long periods of time.

This application is a divisional of Ser. No. 10 376 387 filed Feb. 27 2003 now U.S. Pat. No. 6 951 846 which claims the benefit of priority of provisional application No. 60 362 985 filed Mar. 7 2002.

A novel form of artemisinins that are complexed with cyclodextrin for solving stability problems associated with previous forms of artemisinins.

Artelinic acid is an effective antimalarial agent when in contact with the malarial parasite. However artelinic acid has poor stability in solution and thus has limited bioavailability in vivo. Artemisinins as a class include such analogs as artelinic acid and artesunic acid among many others. Currently no analog of the artemisinin class of compounds exists which can remain stable in solution. Injectable formulations of artemisinin analogs such as artelinic acid and artesunic acid are not FDA approved due to their instability in solution. All artemisinins contain a peroxide bridge susceptible to hydrolytic cleavage. Artemisinins have been found to yield an inferior class of antimalarials due to these severe limitations in chemical stability. Artemisinins are limited to only being packaged as solids for oral dosing as previous patents have claimed. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 326 023 6 307 068 6 306 896 5 834 491 5 677 331 5 637 594 5 486 535 5 278 173 5 270 037 5 219 865 5 021 426 5 011 951.

Application of an antimalarial formulation must be specific to administration in hot humid tropical regions native to the malarial parasite. Thus chemical stability under drastic environmental conditions is essential. Attempts to produce a more stable form of artelinic acid have been accompanied by critical limitations. A soluble sodium salt of artelinic acid has been successfully formulated but eventually degrades over time. This is presumably due to a re formation of the insoluble acid. Numerous attempts at preventing this precipitate have been unsuccessful.

The osmolality of the salt solution is significantly less than the predicted value indicating possible inter molecular complexation that may be responsible for eventual precipitation over time. An amine based buffer of artelinic acid has been successfully formulated but yields a higher pH solution 8.0 that induces significant vein irritation upon injection. Additional localized redness and swelling surrounding the injection site is a notable contraindication to a preferred intravenous formulation. Additionally amine based buffers have been observed to take on a strong yellow hue over time. The mechanism of color formation has not been deduced but implies a modification of the artelinate formulation which is not conducive to pharmaceutical preparations where a defined constant state of purity is essential.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 326 023 6 307 068 6 306 896 5 834 491 5 677 331 5 637 594 5 486 535 5 278 173 5 270 037 5 219 865 5 021 426 5 011 951 are only directed to be packaged as solids for oral dosing.

Therefore there is a need to provide a form of artemisinins that solve the stability problems associated with previous formulations.

It is an object of the present invention to provide a form of artemisinins such as but not limited to artelinic acid and artesunic acid that solves the stability problems associated with previous formulations.

It is another object of the present invention to provide a stable form of artemisinins that is injectable.

It is still another object of the present invention to provide a stable form of artemisinins that does not develop a yellow hue over time.

It is still another object of the invention to promote bioavailability and membrane permeability while decreasing the likelihood of localized inflammation at the route of entry thus increasing its therapeutic activity.

These and other objects of the invention will become apparent upon a reading of the entire disclosure.

The present invention is directed to cyclodextrin complexed with artelinic acid or artesunic acid to form complexed cyclodextrin artemisinin formulations in a 2 1 ratio of cyclodextrin per artelinic acid molecule or in a 1 1 ratio of cyclodextrin per artesunic acid molecule. The formulation is stable in solution bioavailable membrane permeable and does not cause inflammation upon injection.

The present invention is directed to a novel form of artemisinins that remain stable over time in solution. The artemisinins may be but are not limited to artelinic acid and artesunic acid. This novel form of artemisinins uses a unique complexed form of the therapeutic agent with cyclodextrin analogs such as but not limited to alpha beta and gamma cyclodextrin analogs and their derivatives.

The present invention is directed to cyclodextrin complexed with artelinic acid in a 2 1 ratio which is a form of artemisinin that alters the electron cloud surrounding the artemisinin molecule in such a way as to stabilize this agent to promote bioavailability and membrane permeability while decreasing the likelihood of localized inflammation at the route of entry. Thus this form of artemisinin increases its therapeutic activity. Artesunic acid was complexed with cyclodextrin but in a unique 1 1 ratio in such a way as to stabilize the agent yield similar increases in its therapeutic activity.

The stability of the artemisinins is achieved by changing the physiocochemical properties such as but not limited to electron density electrostatic potential and charge transfer mediated complexation.

The complexed cyclodextrin formulation of the artemisinins described deliberately shields the peroxide bridge of the artemisinin backbone from hydrolytic decomposition. Additionally the aromatic benzoic acid portion of the artelinate molecule is also complexed with a second cyclodextrin molecule. This unique 2 1 complexation with cyclodextrin is not intuitively obvious because artelinic acid alone is unstable in aqueous solution. Simply placing cyclodextrin in solution with artelinic acid would not achieve these results as the artelinic acid would not be in contact with the cyclodextrin to form complexation. Futher cyclodextrin is know to form complexes with itself and thus may not be readily available in solution to interact efficiently and effectively with the artelinic acid. The inventors have placed artelinic acid and cyclodextrin into contact with one another and have complexed them in such a manner as to yield a stable 2 1 molecular species. The inventors have also placed artesunic acid and cyclodextrin into contact with one another and have complexed them in such a manner as to yield a stable 1 1 molecular species.

 cyclodextrin was obtained from Sigma Aldrich Corp. St. Louis Mo. Artelinic acid was alkalinized with NaOH to yield the sodium salt. Standardized PBS buffer at a pH of 7.4 was obtained from Invitrogen Corp. Carlsbad Calif.

Mixtures of artelinate 10 M were prepared with increasing concentrations of cyclodextrin 0.0 1.0 4.0 6.0 and 9.0 mM . Absorption spectra were collected on a Beckman DU Series 600 Spectrophotometer.

The spectra collected indicated a clear hypsochromic or blue shift in the absorption maximum at 230 nm with increasing concentrations of cyclodextrin. Hypochromic effects were also notable at 230 nm as well as the broader transitions observed at 275 and 382 nm . This combined observation is consistent with inclusion interactions of the benzoic anion of artelinate with cyclodextrin.

Changes in observed isosbestic points at higher cyclodextrin concentrations indicates a complicated molecular species containing greater than a simple 1 1 molecular species and .

Mixtures of cyclodextrin 2.5 mM and artelinic acid 1.2 mM were prepared in PBS pH 7.4 and incubated at 37 C. for 2 3 hour to promote complexation prior to analysis.

All H NMR data was collected using a Bruker DRX 600 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 600.02 MHz at a temperature of 25 C. Solvent suppression was accomplished by application of the WATERGATE WATER suppression by GrAdient Tailored Excitation pulse sequence developed by Sklenar and co workers. This sequence provides excellent suppression of the water resonance by a combination of rf pulses and a series of gradient pulses. The sequence combines a non selective 90 pulse with a symmetrical echo formed by two short gradient pulses in conjunction with a 180 selective on water pulse train.

The two dimensional WATERGATE TOCSY experiment employed a modified MLEV 17 spin lock sequence for a total mixing time of 80 ms including the 2.5 ms trim pulses at the beginning and the end of the spin lock. The spectrum was collected with a spectral width of 7183.91 Hz 11.972 ppm using 2K data points with 32 scans per 256 tincrements with a 1.5 s recycle delay. The data was processed by multiplication with a 90 shifted sine bell window function in each dimension with one zero fill in the fdimension before transformation to produce matrices consisting of 512 data points in both dimensions.

The two dimensional WATERGATE NOESY spectra were collected with a spectral width of 7183.91 Hz 11.972 ppm using 2K data points with 128 scans per 512 tincrements with a 1.5 s recycle delay. The data was processed by multiplication with a 90 shifted sine bell window function in each dimension with one zero fill in the fdimension before transformation to produce matrices consisting of 512 data points in both dimensions. Two different experiments were conducted with mixing times of 50 and 600 ms.

The two dimensional WATERGATE ROESY spectrum was collected with a spectral width of 7183.91 Hz 11.972 ppm using 2K data points with 256 scans per 512 tincrements with a 1.5 s recycle delay with a spin lock mixing pulse of 400 ms. The data was processed by multiplication with a 90 shifted sine bell window function in each dimension with one zero fill in the fdimension before transformation to produce matrices consisting of 512 data points in both dimensions.

Two dimensional NMR methods were used to determine the degree of capping or complexation of artelinic acid by cyclodextrin. The 2D WATERGATE TOSCY spectrum of artelinic acid clearly indicates that the individual spin spin coupling networks of a mixture of artelinic acid and cyclodextrin can be resolved. In the spin spin coupling network for cyclodextrin is shown at A and the spin spin coupling network for the alkyl ring of artenilate is shown at B. The 2D rotating frame NOE spectrum WATERGATE ROESY of artelinic acid was collected at a mixing time of 400 ms and is shown in . The labeled intermolecular ROE interaction between the aromatic protons of artelinic acid with both the anomeric and ring protons of cyclodextrin proves that this region of artelinic acid is complexed with one molecule of cyclodextrin. In A B and C indicate the intermolecular dipolar ROE coupling between the aromatic protons of artelinate with the glucose ring protons of cyclodextrin. The ROE between the meta protons are more intense than those observed for the ortho protons indicating that meta protons are inserted deeper into the cavity. D and F indicate the dipolar coupling between the ortho protons of artelinate with the two benzyl protons of artelinate. E indicates the dipolar coupling between the meta protons of artelinate with the anomeric protons of cyclodextrin. shows the alkyl region of this same spectrum. The labeled intermolecular ROE s between the alkyl ring protons of artelinic acid with both the anomeric and ring protons of cyclodextrin indicate that this region of artelinic acid is complexed with one molecule of cyclodextrin. These observations are similar to those reported by Nishijo Nishijo J. Nagai M. Yasuda M. Ohno E. Ushiroda Y. 1995 84 1420 1426 and by Redenti Redenti E. Ventura P. Fronza G. Selva A. Rivara S. Plazzi P. V. Mor M. 1999 88 599 607 in similar NMR cyclodextrin complexation studies. In A represents a region that contains the dipolar coupling between the ring protons of cyclodextrin and the alkyl ring proton of artelinate and B represents the region that contains the dipolar coupling of the anomeric protons of cyclodextrin with the alkyl protons of artelinate.

Two 2D WATERGATE NOESY spectra were collected at mixing times of 50 and 600 ms data not shown . The NOESY spectrum collected at 600 ms gave similar intermolecular and intramolecular NOE s to those observed in the ROESY spectrum however the observed intensities were reduced. The NOESY spectrum collected at 50 ms did not exhibit the intermolecular NOE s between artenilate and cyclodextrin. This observation is consistent with what one would expect due to the fact that intermolecular NOE s require a longer mixing time to develop as compared to intramolecular NOE s.

The 2D ROESY and NOESY data clearly indicate that both the alkyl and aromatic regions of artelinic acid are complexed with one individual molecule of cyclodextrin.

In the spectrum of artesunate with an excess of cyclodextrin in PBS is shown. This data clearly indicates that the artesunate is capped by cyclodextrin in a 1 1 ratio. The region that is represented by A contains the intramolecular dipolar coupling the alkyl ring proton of artesunate. The region that is represented by B contains the intermolecular dipolar coupling the alkyl ring proton of artesunate with the ring protons of cyclodextrin. The region that is represented by C contains the intermolecular dipolar coupling the alkyl ring proton of artesunate with the anomeric protons of cyclodextrin. The region that is represented by D contains additional intramolecular dipolar coupling the alkyl ring proton of artesunate. The region that is represented by E contains the intramolecular dipolar coupling of the cyclodextrin.

Table 2 summarizes the chemical shift assignments for cyclodextrin compared with the corresponding complexes with artelinic acid and artesunic acid as derived from . The change in chemical shifts clearly demonstrate that both cyclodextrins of the artelinic acid complex and the cyclodextrin of the artesunic acid complex coordinate at the 3 H end or secondary face of the cyclodextrin. Further the benzoic acid moiety of artelinic acid coordinates deeply into the cyclodextrin pocket yielding significant changes in chemical shift for the 3 H 5 H and 6 H protons. In contrast artesunic acid which only binds to one cyclodextrin at the peroxide bridge produced chemical shift changes of a lower magnitude indicating a more shallow binding interaction. Lastly for the artesunate cyclodextrin complex the changes in chemical shift indicate of 6H

Molecular Electrostatic Potential MEP maps on cyclodextrin and artelinic acid were developed by calculating electrostatic potentials on the van der Waals surface of the molecules using the semi empirical PM3 molecular orbital theory as implemented in the SPARTAN software SPARTAN version 4.0 Wavefunction Inc. 18401 Von Karman Ave. 370 Irvine Calif. 92715 U.S.A. 1995 Wavefintion Inc. . PM3 is a semi empirical quantum chemical theory model based on Thiel s integral formalism underlying MNDO d and is used in conjunction with parameters for both transition and non transition metals reference a W. Thiel and A. Voityuk 81 391 1992 b W. Thiel and A. Voityuk 44 807 1992 .

Molecular electrostatic potential MEP maps and their electrostatic potential energy isopotential profiles were generated and sampled over the entire accessible surface of a molecule corresponding roughly to a van der Waals contact surface . The MEP maps provide a measure of charge distribution from the point of view of an approaching reagent. This is calculated using a test positive charge as the probe. Thus these types of profiles can provide an estimate of electronic distribution surrounding the molecule so as to enable qualitative assessment of any possible interaction with an approaching molecule. However conformation search calculations using the systematic search technique via the single point PM3 method of SPARTAN were used to generate different conformers for each of the molecules. The minimum energy conformer with highest abundance a Boltzman population density greater than 70.0 was chosen for full geometry optimization using the PM3 algorithm. The MEP profiles were generated on the optimized geometry of the molecules. The computations were carried out on a Silicon Graphics Octane workstation.

To further understand the binding affinities between cyclodextrin and artelinic acid the complete optimized structures of both the compounds have been considered and docking calculations using the Docking affinity module in Insight II Accelrys Inc. 9685 Scranton Road San Diego Calif. 92121 3752 were conducted. See Oprea T. I. and Marshall G. R. 1998 Receptor based prediction of binding affinities. Perspectives in Drug Discovery and Design 9 10 11 35 61 and Insight II User Guide San Diego 

Docking affinity module in Insight II allows calculating the nonbonded energy between two molecules using explicit van der Waals energy explicit electrostatic Coulombic energy or both van der Waals and electrostatic energies. The number of atoms included in the calculation can be limited by specifying a monomer or residue based cutoff. Other methods known in the art may be used for example the computation can be done using a pre computed energy grid.

These molecular modeling determinations based on unique and specific physicochemical properties of the artemisinins studied complexed with cyclodextrin produced conceptual models which clearly rationalized the direct physical measurements of the NMR experiments. illustrate the unique electrostatic potential map of cyclodextrin showing the primary binding faces and and secondary binding faces and . Most notable is the unique net positive region of the electron cloud at the primary face.

Lastly directly illustrates the unique physicochemical interaction of the electrostatc potential map of cyclodextrin with that of the artelinic acid tail. This axial view into the primary face of the second cyclodextrin molecule clearly illustrates this unique and selective electrostatic interaction. The negative region of the electrostatic potential map is shown at and the positive region of electrostatic potential map is shown at .

Simple docking calculations do not yield these results as they assume an in vacuo environment. Inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins are mediated by the release of high energy water molecules from the inner core of the cyclodextrin molecule. Therefore direct structural measurements of the complex by techniques such as high resolution multi dimensional NMR rationalized by physicochemical property determinations such as but not limited to molecular electrostratic potential mapping is specifically required to accurately characterize these complexes.

Solutions of hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin and artelinic acid of varied compositions as indicated were measured at room temperature using a Fiske ONE TEN Osmometer Fiske Associates Norwood Mass. USA . The solvent for all experiments was ultra pure distilled deionized water 18 M filtered through a 0.45 m filter. Small sample volumes 15 L were measured in units of mOsmol kg water with an instrument repeatability of 2 mOsmol kg water in the data range studied 0 to 400 mOsmol kg water . The instrument was calibrated routinely with NIST standards of NaCl and a daily NIST reference of NaCl was verified at the start of each set of experiments.

Osmolality is a direct measure of the degree of molecular dissociation of a species in water. illustrates the deviation of measured osmolality in aqueous artelinate solutions versus theoretical calculations which assume complete dissociation. This deviation from ideality also appears to have a significant margin of error as observed by the marked degree of data scatter in the measurments.

Measured deviation in osmolality of the artelinic acid cyclodextrin 1 2 formulation after 28 days at room temperature was 

The stable form of artemisinin the cyclodextrin complexed with artenilate in a 2 1 ratio may be dissolved in saline phosphate buffered saline PBS deionized water or any other suitable aqueous carrier for injection. The pH is preferably about 7.4. Generally 40 milligrams of artelinate complexed with cyclodextrin per milliliter of solution is suitable. A dose of about 4 6 mg of artelinic acid in complex per kilogram of weight for a human is an appropriate dose. An injection of 10 ml of complex in solution or less is appropriate for treatment.

The formulation of the cyclodextrin complexed with artelinate in solution can be prepared and pumped through a filter into an injection vile freeze dried for storage and later rehydrated with sterile water or saline or PBS for injection. The cyclodextrin complexed with artelinate in solution can also be administered orally sublingually or in the form of a suppository.

Cyclodextrins and artemisinins are both non toxic to humans. However large doses of cyclodextrins are not implicated in cases where kidneys are not fully functional.

See U.S. Pat. No. 6 284 772 which is herein incorporated by reference. The in vitro assays were conducted by using a modification of the semiautomated microdilution technique of Desjardins et al. 1979 16 710 718 and Chulay et al. 1983 55 138 146. Two strains of clones from CDC Indochina III W 2 CDC Sierra Leone I D 6 . The W 2 elone is susceptible to mefloquine but resistant to chloroquine sulfadoxine pyrimethamine and quinine. The D 6 clone is resistant to mefloquine but susceptible to chloroquine sulfadoxine pyrimethamine and quinine. These clones were derived by direct visualization and micromanipulation from patient isolates. Test compounds were initially dissolved in DMSO and diluted 400 fold in RPMI 1640 culture mediun supplemented with 25 mM HEPES 32 mM HaHCO and 10 Albumax I GIBCO BRL Grand Island N.Y. . These solutions were subsequently serially diluted 2 fold with a Biomek 1000 Heckman Fullerton Calif. over 11 different concentrations. The parasites were exposed to aerial dilutions of each compound for 48 h and incubated at 37 C. with 5 O 5 CO and 90 Nprior to the addition of H hypoxanthine. After a further incubation of 18 h parasite DNA was harvested from each microtiter wall using Packard Filtermate 196 Harvester Meriden Conn. onto glass filters. Update of H hypoxanthine was measured with a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Concentration response data were analyzed by a nonlinear regression logistic dose response model and the ICvalues 50 inhibitory concentrations for each compound were determined.

The complexed cyclodextrin artemisinins formulation does not precipitate or degrade over time. Formulations of artemisinins and cyclodextrin have been observed to remain completely soluble for up to seven weeks at elevated physiological temperatures 40 degrees C. without any degradation and up to 6 months at room temperature. The complexed cyclodextrin formulation of the artemisinins does not change color over time. Formulations of artemisinins and cyclodextrin have been observed to remain colorless for several weeks at elevated physiological temperatures of 40 degrees C.

Measure 2 moles of cyclodextrin and pre dissolve in buffer deionized water or saline. Sonicate the mixture to completely dissolve the cyclodextrin. Add 1 mole equivalent of artelinic acid and sonicate. Incubate at 40 C. for 2 3 hours. Higher concentrations of artelinic acid require longer incubation times such as overnight to promote complexation.

Measure 1 mole of cyclodextrin and pre dissolve in buffer deionized water or saline. Sonicate the mixture to completely dissolve the cyclodextrin. Add 1 mole equivalent of artesunic acid and sonicate. Incubate at 40 C. for 2 3 hours. Higher concentrations of artesunic acid require longer incubation times to promote complexation.

The use of the complexed cyclodextrin formulation of the artemisinins described provides a shielding effect to protect the body from local toxic effects from the antimalarial agent until the drug is diluted sufficiently into the system.

The process of making the complexed artemisinins of the invention can be performed on a large scale using similar conditions.

Having now fully described the invention it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that many changes and modifications can be made thereto without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as set for the herein.
