title: Analyzing scripts and determining characters in expression recognition
abstract: A mechanism for recognizing and inputting handwritten mathematical expressions into a computer by providing part of a multi-path framework is described. The part of the multi-path framework includes a subscript/superscript analysis and character determination component that is designed to identify subscript and superscript elements. A method for analyzing a handwritten mathematical expression includes receiving a symbols corresponding to handwritten mathematical expression input strokes, identifying subscript and/or superscript structures, and determining a character for each symbol of the set. A graph of vertexes and edges may be created based upon the set of symbols and the graph may be searched to determine optimized candidates.
