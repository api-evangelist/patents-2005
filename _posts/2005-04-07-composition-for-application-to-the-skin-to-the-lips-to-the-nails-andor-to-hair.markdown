This non provisional application claims the benefit of French Application No. 04 50712 filed on Apr. 8 2004 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 564 971 filed on Apr. 26 2004 both of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates to cosmetic compositions for application to the skin including the mucous membranes such as the lips to the nails or to hair such as the eyelashes the eyebrows and head hair.

The preparation of compositions including a coloring agent that can reflect light and or modify the visual perception of the cosmetic composition is known. In association with such a coloring agent it is known to incorporate into the composition pigments of an organic or inorganic nature in the pure form which may have the disadvantage of reducing the transparency of the composition so that the maximum benefit of the optical effects produced by said coloring agent cannot be enjoyed.

There is a need for a cosmetic composition having satisfactory color and including a coloring agent that can produce a specific optical effect that is sufficiently visible.

One aspect of the present disclosure provides a composition for application to the skin to the lips to the nails and or to hair the composition comprising 

The specific optical effect may be a sparkle effect a goniochromatic effect a speckled effect or any other desired optical effect.

A sparkle effect may for example result in highlight points in the composition contrasting with the surrounding color. The highlight points may be due to reflective particles for example.

A speckled effect may result in the composition having speckles of color present therein that are visible to the eye the speckles being due for example to flakes or fibers.

In another aspect of the present disclosure compositions can be obtained that are both colored and have an optical effect that is visible to the naked eye due to the presence of the second coloring agent.

For example the first coloring agent present in the composition may provide color while preserving the transparency or translucence desired in the composition so that the optical effect provided by the second coloring agent remains visible to the naked eye.

The at least one first coloring agent may be present in the composition in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 20 by weight relative to the total composition weight. In one embodiment the at least one first coloring agent may be present in the composition in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 10 by weight relative to the total composition weight.

The composite pigment may be manufactured by any appropriate method for example a mechano chemical method or a method of precipitation in solution with dissolution of an organic coloring substance and a precipitation thereof at the surface of the core.

In one embodiment the composite pigment may be manufactured by a method comprising a mechanical mixing of an organic pigment and the inorganic core. A binder may be added and mixed with the inorganic core before the introduction of the organic coloring substance.

The composite pigment may for example be produced using one of the processes described in European Patent Application Nos. EP 1 184 426 and EP 1 217 046 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In one embodiment the composite pigments are produced by the process described in European Patent Application No. EP 1 184 426.

In an embodiment of the present disclosure the particles comprising the inorganic core are first mixed with the at least one binder.

So that the binder can adhere uniformly to the surface of the inorganic core the particles may be passed initially through a mill to disaggregate them.

The mixing and agitation conditions are selected so that the core can be uniformly coated with binder. The conditions may be controlled so that the linear load ranges from 19.6 N cm newtons centimeter to 19160 N cm. In one embodiment the linear load ranges from 98 N cm to 14170 N cm. In a further embodiment the linear load ranges from 147 N cm to 980 N cm. The treatment time ranges from 5 minutes to 24 hours and in one embodiment ranges from 10 minutes to 20 hours. The rotation rate may range from 2 rpm revolutions per minute to 1000 rpm. In one embodiment the rotation rate ranges from 5 rpm to 1000 rpm and in a further embodiment the rotation rate ranges from 10 rpm to 800 rpm.

After coating the inorganic core with the at least one binder the at least one organic coloring substance is added and mixed with agitation so that it adheres to the layer of binder.

Mixing and agitation whether of the inorganic cores with the at least one binder or of the at least one organic coloring substance with the inorganic cores coated with binder may be carried out using an apparatus which can apply a sharp shearing and or compressive force to the mixture of powders. Examples of apparatus of that type are roller mixers blade mixers and the like. In one embodiment roller mixers are used. A list of suitable apparatus is given in European Patent Application No. EP 1 184 426 A2.

A further method for manufacturing a composite pigment has been described in Japanese Patent JP 3286463 which discloses a solution precipitation process.

The at least one organic coloring substance is dissolved in ethanol and the inorganic cores are then dispersed in said ethanolic solution.

An aqueous alkaline solution of sodium or potassium carbonate is then slowly added to these mixtures and finally an ethanolic calcium chloride solution is slowly added with constant agitation.

The at least one second coloring agent can comprise for example reflective particles pearlescent agents or nacres and or a goniochromatic coloring agents.

The at least one second coloring agent may comprise particles having the form of flakes or it may be in a globular form.

Among substrates that may be use when the at least one second coloring agent has a multilayered structure non limiting mention may be made of substrates comprising at least one material chosen from metals metal oxides and polymers.

The at least one second coloring agent may comprise at least one material chosen from micas synthetic micas talc silicas and aluminas.

The at least one second coloring agent may comprise particles based on glass surface metallized particles or particles comprising a metal chosen from aluminum bronze copper and alloys thereof.

The term reflective particles as used in the context of the present disclosure means particles the size and structure of which in particular the thickness of the layer or layers constituting them and their physical and chemical natures and their surface state allow them to reflect incident light. In one embodiment the reflection may have sufficient intensity to create highlight points on the surface of the composition of the present disclosure when the composition is applied to the surface to be made up which highlight points are visible to the naked eye i.e. they are points of greater brightness that contrast with their environment and appear to shine.

In one embodiment the reflective particles may occlude the visual perception of the curvature of the made up surface by preventing the eye of the observer from obtaining a lock the highlight points being capable of appearing or disappearing in a random manner when the made up surface and the observer are moving.

The reflective particles may also be selected in a manner such that they do not significantly alter the coloring effect generated by the first coloring agent associated therewith or even to optimize that effect in terms of color yield. In one embodiment the reflective particles may have a yellow pink red bronze orangey brown and or copper glint.

The reflective particles used should be compatible with cosmetic use and they should be able to subsist in a physiologically acceptable medium in particular they should not be dissolved therein or in any case they should not dissolve entirely therein.

The solid particles may be in various forms. In one embodiment the particles may be in the form of flakes or they may be globular such as spherical.

Particles with a substantially planar outer surface are also suitable since if their size structure and surface state allow it they readily give rise to an intense specular reflection. This is known as a mirror effect.

For such particles it is essentially the light returned by reflection in one direction making the same angle with the normal to the reflective surface as the angle made by the incident light to that normal which allows the particles to appear as highlight points and not the light diffused in all other directions.

In another embodiment the reflective particles do not substantially alter the color of the cosmetic composition.

In an embodiment where the reflective particles do not substantially alter the color of the cosmetic composition reflective particles which allow a metallic reflection of incident light may be used. Such metallic reflection can occur when the reflective particles whatever their shape can allow reflection onto a layer of a metal for example silver. Such particles appear relatively neutral as regards the color of the composition.

Reflective particles that may be used in the composition of the present disclosure and have a metallic or white glint may for example reflect light in all components of the visible region without significantly absorbing one or more wavelengths. The spectral reflectance of such reflective particles can for example be more than 70 in the range 400 nm nanometers to 700 nm and may be at least 80 or even 90 or 95 .

The light reflected by the reflective particles need not be iridescent such as when the glint is metallic.

Regardless of their form the reflective particles may optionally have a multilayered structure in the case of a multi layered structure for example they may have at least one layer of uniform thickness such as a reflective material.

When the reflective particles do not have a multilayered structure they may for example be composed of metal oxides such as oxides of titanium or iron obtained by synthesis so that they have a substantially planar surface having a surface state which is not matt for example and not diffusing allowing sufficient specular light reflection to obtain highlight points in the cosmetic composition.

When the reflective particles have a multilayered structure they may for example comprise a natural or synthetic substrate such as a synthetic substrate which is at least partially coated with at least one layer of a reflective material such as at least one metal or metallic compound. The substrate may be a single material or a multiple materials organic and or inorganic and solid or hollow.

Regardless of the form of the reflective particles when it is synthetic the substrate may be produced in a form that encourages the formation of a reflective surface after coating such as after depositing a layer of reflective material. As an example the substrate may have a planar surface and the layer of reflective material may have a substantially uniform thickness.

In one embodiment among the substrates that may be used non limiting mention may be made of substrates chosen from glasses ceramics graphite metal oxides aluminas silicas silicates such as aluminosilicates and borosilicates talc mica synthetic mica metals and mixtures thereof.

The layer of metal or of a metallic compound may optionally completely coat the substrate and the metal layer may be at least partially coated with a layer of another material for example a transparent material. In one embodiment the layer of metal or of metallic compound to coat the substrate completely directly or indirectly i.e. with the interposition of at least one intermediate layer which may optionally be metallic.

In one embodiment the metal may be chosen from Ag Au Cu Al Ni Sn Mg Cr Mo Ti Pt Va Rb W Zn Ge Te Se and mixtures thereof. In a further embodiment the metal may be chosen from Ag Au Al Zn Ni Mo Cr Cu and their alloys for example bronzes and brasses .

When the particles comprise substrates coated with silver or gold the metallic layer may be present in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 50 of the total particle weight such as an amount ranging from 1 to 20 for example.

Glass particles coated with a metallic layer have been described in Japanese Patent documents JP A 09188830 JP A 10158450 JP A 10158541 JP A 07258460 and JP A 05017710 the contents of which are incorporated by reference.

These pigments such as those described in Japanese patent JP 2001 11340 are flakes of C GLASS glass comprising 65 to 72 of SiOcoated with a layer of rutile type titanium oxide TiO . Such glass pellets have a mean thickness of 1 micrometer m and a mean size of 80 m giving a mean size mean thickness ratio of 80. They have blue green yellow or silvery glints depending on the thickness of the TiOlayer.

Further mention may be made of particles with dimensions in the range 80 m to 100 m comprising a substrate of synthetic mica fluorophlogopite coated with titanium dioxide representing 12 of the total particle weight sold under the trade name PROMINENCE by NIHON KOKEN.

The reflective particles may also be chosen from particles formed by a stack of at least two layers with different refractive indices.

The at least two layers may be polymeric or metallic in nature and in one embodiment they may include at least one polymeric layer.

Such particles are described in International and United States Patents WO 99 36477 U.S. Pat. No. 6 299 979 and U.S. Pat. No. 6 387 498.

The at least one second coloring agent may comprise at least one gonio chromatic coloring agent so that when the composition is applied to its surface it creates a colored base having color that changes with the angle of observation. A goniochromatic coloring agent in the context of the present disclosure allows a color change also termed a color flop to be observed as a function of the angle of observation which change is greater than that which is encountered with nacres. A single goniochromatic coloring agent may be used for ease of implementation.

The goniochromatic coloring agent may be selected so that it presents a relatively large color change with changing angle of observation.

The goniochromatic coloring agent may thus be selected so that for a variation in the angle of observation in the range 0 to 80 with illumination at 45 the color of the cosmetic composition is observed to vary by an amount E of at least 2 as measured in the 1976 CIE International Commission on Illumination calorimetric space.
