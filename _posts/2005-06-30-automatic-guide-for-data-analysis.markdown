title: Automatic guide for data analysis
abstract: A system for analyzing data is disclosed. In one general aspect it includes a data analysis user interface responsive to user interaction to initiate actions on the data. An action logging interface is operative to create a logged sequence of actions as the user initiates them through the data analysis user interface. And a token-based authoring user interface responsive to user selection commands to select action-tokens corresponding to the actions logged by the action logging interface to create an authored set of actions that has an authored sequence that can be different from the logged sequence.
