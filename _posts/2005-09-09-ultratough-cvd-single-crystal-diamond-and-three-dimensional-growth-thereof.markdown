The present invention claims the benefit of Provisional Application No. 60 608 516 filed on Sep. 10 2004 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with U.S. government support under grant number EAR 0135626 from the National Science Foundation and instrument number DE FC03 03NA00144 from the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to an annealed single crystal CVD diamond having an extremely high toughness. The invention also relates to a process for producing a single crystal CVD diamond in three dimensions on a single crystal diamond substrate using Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition MPCVD within a deposition chamber.

Large scale production of synthetic diamond has long been an objective of both research and industry. Diamond in addition to its gem properties is the hardest known material has the highest known thermal conductivity and is transparent to a wide variety of electromagnetic radiation. Monocrystalline diamond in particular possess a wide range of important properties including a low coefficient of thermal expansion the highest known thermal conductivity chemical inertness wear resistance low friction and optical transparency from the ultra violet UV to the far infrared IR . Therefore it is valuable because of its wide range of applications in a number of industries and research applications in addition to its value as a gemstone.

For at least the last twenty years a process of producing small quantities of diamond by chemical vapor deposition CVD has been available. As reported by B. V. Spitsyn et al. in Vapor Growth of Diamond on Diamond and Other Surfaces Journal of Crystal Growth vol. 52 pp. 219 226 the process involves CVD of diamond on a substrate by using a combination of methane or another simple hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen gas at reduced pressures and temperatures of 800 1200 C. The inclusion of hydrogen gas prevents the formation of graphite as the diamond nucleates and grows. Growth rates of up to 1 m hour have been reported with this technique.

Subsequent work for example that of Kamo et al. as reported in Diamond Synthesis from Gas Phase in Microwave Plasma Journal of Crystal Growth vol. 62 pp. 642 644 demonstrated the use of Microwave Plasma Chemical Vapor Deposition MPCVD to produce diamond at pressures of 1 8 kPa at temperatures of 800 1000 C. with microwave power of 300 700 W at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. A concentration of 1 3 methane gas was used in the process of Kamo et al. Maximum growth rates of 3 m hour have been reported using this MPCVD process. In the above described processes and in a number of other reported processes the growth rates are limited to only a few micrometers per hour.

Methods of improving the growth rates of single crystal chemical vapor deposition SC CVD diamonds have recently been reported and these methods have opened new opportunities for the application of diamond for gems optics and electronics.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 858 078 to Hemley et al. is directed to an apparatus and method for diamond production. The disclosed apparatus and method can lead to the production of diamonds that are light brown to colorless.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 889 171 is directed to annealing single crystal chemical vapor deposition diamonds. Important inventive features include raising the CVD diamond to a set temperature of at least 1500 C. and a pressure of at least 4.0 GPa outside of the diamond stable phase.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 889 170 is directed to diamonds with improved hardness. The application discloses a single crystal diamond with a hardness greater than 120 GPa.

U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 889 169 is directed to diamonds with improved toughness. The application discloses a single crystal diamond with a fracture toughness of 11 20 MPamand a hardness of 50 90 GPa.

The aforementioned disclosures do not disclose single crystal diamonds having a toughness over 20 MPam. Nor do they disclose methods to produce single crystal diamond with growth in three dimensions on a single crystal diamond substrate.

Accordingly the present invention is directed to a single crystal diamond and a method of producing such a diamond that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.

An object of the present invention relates to an ultratough diamond and a method of producing such a diamond in a microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition system. Another object of the present invention relates to a method to produce single crystal diamond with growth in three dimensions on a single crystal diamond substrate.

Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows and in part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objectives and other advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by the structure particularly pointed out in the written description and claims hereof as well as the appended drawings.

To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention as embodied and broadly described an embodiment of the invention comprises a single crystal diamond grown by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition that has a toughness of at least about 30 MPa m.

Another embodiment of the invention relates to a method for growing an ultratough single crystal diamond comprising 

Another embodiment of the invention relates to a process for producing a single crystal CVD diamond in three dimensions on a single crystal diamond substrate comprising 

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.

Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention the results of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

The microwave plasma CVD grown single crystal diamond referred to in this application were grown with the apparatus described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 288 499 filed on Nov. 6 2002 now U.S. Pat. No. 6 858 078 entitled Apparatus and Method for Diamond Production which is hereby incorporated by reference.

One embodiment of the invention includes a single crystal diamond grown by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition that has a toughness of at least about 30 MPa m. In another embodiment the toughness of the single crystal diamond is at least about 35 MPa m. In another embodiment the toughness of the single crystal diamond is at least about 40 MPa m.

The diamonds in these embodiments of the invention were subjected to annealing for example at temperatures of about 2000 C. to about 2700 C. for about 10 minutes using a belt type apparatus. This caused a dramatic increase in the hardness of the diamonds. In another embodiment the hardness is from about 100 to about 160 GPa.

The hardness in the aforementioned embodiments of the invention is determined by the equation of H 1.854 P Din which P is the maximum load used on the indenter to form an indentation into the single crystal diamond and D is the length of the longest crack formed by the indenter in the single crystal diamond and h is the depth of the indentation into the single crystal diamond.

The toughness or fracture toughness Kof the single crystal diamond in the aforementioned embodiments is determined by the equation of K 0.016 0.004 E H P C in which E is the Young s modulus of diamond d is the average length of the indentation cavity in the single crystal diamond and c is the average length of the radial cracks in the single crystal diamond.

In another embodiment the aforementioned method further comprises annealing the single crystal diamond at pressures in excess of about 5 to about 7 GPa and temperatures of from about 2000 C. to about 2700 C. such that the hardness is from about 100 to about 160 GPa. In yet another embodiment the single crystal diamond prior to annealing is substantially colorless.

Another embodiment of the invention includes a process for producing a single crystal CVD diamond in three dimensions on a single crystal diamond substrate comprising 

Microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition MPCVD using type Ib synthetic diamond substrates at gas pressures of about 150 torr atm and temperatures of about 1000 1400 C. transformed the diamond substrate from yellow to green. The color change is achieved by placing the Ib diamond on a substrate holder with only modest thermal conductivity e.g. hBN powder or Mo wires to hold the substrate . The color change appears similar to that reported for natural diamond on HPHT annealing. See I. M. Reinitz et al. 2000 36 128. On the other hand CVD diamond did not undergo obvious color changes and transformed to graphite at temperatures above 1800 C. in the same process. It was therefore of interest to anneal CVD diamond at higher temperature over 2000 C. by High Pressure High Temperature HPHT methods.

Single crystal diamonds were synthesized by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition CVD at 8 20 CH H 0.2 3 N CH 160 220 torr at various temperatures. The diamonds shown in were grown at the following temperatures a 1300 C. b 1250 C. c 1400 C. d 1200 C. e 1050 C. Diamond f is the type Ib diamond substrate 4 4 1.5 mm . All substrates were HPHT synthetic type Ib yellow diamonds with 100 faces on top and on the sides. Morphologies and colors of the as grown CVD diamonds strongly depend on the deposition temperature. The irregular edges with brown darker step flow surfaces are associated with higher temperature about 1300 1400 C. . The smooth colorless CVD diamonds enlarged along three dimensions are observed at lower temperature deposition about 1050 1200 C. . At temperatures over about 1500 C. black layers begin to form. Below about 900 C. black microcrystalline material is deposited.

Notably the top growth surface of the sample has been enlarged by a factor of two relative to the substrate whereas the shape of the sample in remains similar. This observation indicates that colorless CVD diamond with nitrogen added can be enlarged along three directions at deposition temperatures around 1200 C. Such three dimensional enlargement of the structures at around 1200 C. is important for continued growth to produce gem quality diamond with much larger lateral dimensions than the substrates. Under these conditions gem quality CVD diamond can be grown individually and sequentially on the 6 100 faces of the substrate. By this method a one inch cube of single crystal diamond 300 carat is achievable.

Various colorless to brown single crystal CVD diamonds were HPHT annealed aCVD all were all made colorless at temperatures of about 2000 2700 C. and about 5 7 GPa for about 10 minutes using a belt type apparatus. Before HPHT annealing these CVD diamonds exhibited high toughness and after annealing the hardness of these diamonds increased dramatically.

The indentation patterns of various diamonds are shown in . shows the indentation pattern of Natural IIa diamond that has a hardness of approximately 110 GPa. shows the indentation pattern of annealed IIa diamond with a hardness of approximately 140 GPa. shows the indentation pattern of unannealed CVD diamond with a hardness of about 60 GPa. shows the indentation pattern of annealed colorless ultrahard aCVD diamond grown under low nitrogen conditions which has a hardness of about 160 GPa. shows the indentation pattern of ultrahard aCVD diamond grown under high nitrogen conditions which has a hardness of about 160 GPa. shows the indentation pattern of colorless ultratough aCVD diamond grown under high nitrogen conditions with a hardness of from about 100 to about 160 GPa. The circular indentation patterns seen after annealing in the colorless diamonds grown at low nitrogen methane ratio about 0.4 N CH and about 1200 C. are similar to those of annealed natural type IIa diamonds . The annealed dark brown diamonds grown with higher nitrogen about 4 N CH and high temperatures about 1300 C. possess square fracture patterns after annealing the darker CVD crystal cannot be readily indented that is it is superhard. A remarkable fracture pattern was observed for the colorless diamond grown at high nitrogen after annealing . Calculation of the toughness gives a lower limit of about 30 MPa m. As used herein and unless otherwise specified ultratough diamonds means diamonds with a toughness greater than about 30 MPa m.

It is important to note that no grain boundaries were optically observed in aCVD diamonds. The aCVD crystals do not have obvious nitrogen related absorption peaks at 1000 1500 cm even if a small amount of nitrogen is intentionally added to the synthesis gas thus these diamonds may be considered type IIa. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the mechanism of hardness toughness enhancement and color changes in aCVD diamonds differs from annealed natural or HPHT synthetic diamond where nitrogen dominates.

Examination under crossed polarizers shows this CVD diamond has relatively high internal stress in comparison to other diamonds. After HPHT treatment the stress can be reduced but in Ia Ib IIa diamonds the stress can increase after annealing. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that this phenomenon implies the hardness enhancement in annealed IIa may be due to stress induced dislocation although further investigation of this is needed see K Kanda 2003 12 1760 1765 .

Additional information is obtained from measurements of x ray rocking curve including rocking curve maps. The full width at half maximum FWHM of the colorless diamond is 20 arcsec brown CVD is 80 arcsec and aCVD is 150 300 arcsec. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the broadened FWHM in the aCVD crystal is likely associated with the a C H in CVD transforming to denser diamond domains with a fair amount of mosaic spread.

The mechanism of the very high fracture toughness documented here may be associated with the small amount of amorphous carbon or dislocations that exist in these single crystal CVD diamonds. Denser spor sphybridized nanocrystals combined with changes in nitrogen and hydrogen impurities on their grain boundary may occur during HPHT annealing.

The ultratough diamonds of the invention and diamonds produced by the above methods will be sufficiently large tough defect free and translucent so as to be useful as for example windows in high power laser or synchrotron applications as anvils in high pressure apparatuses as cutting instruments as wire dies as components for electronics heat sinks substrates for electronic devices or as gems. Other examples of uses or applications for the above ultratough diamonds and diamonds made by the above methods include the following 

The ultratough diamonds disclosed herein are particularly useful in applications including but not limited to water fluid jet nozzles razors surgical blades microtone hardness indentor graphical tools stichels instruments used in the repair of lithographic pieces missile radomes bearings including those used in ultra high speed machines diamond biomolecule devices microtomes hardness indentors and anvils in high pressure apparatuses.

In one embodiment the present invention is directed to anvils in high pressure apparatuses wherein the anvils comprise ultratough single crystal CVD diamond. Anvils comprising ultratough single crystal CVD diamond can be used at higher pressures than anvils made of other materials such as tungsten carbide. Examples of anvil designs that can comprise single crystal CVD diamonds include Bridgman anvils including but not limited to Bridgman anvils that are relatively large include variable heights and include major angles and Paris Edinburgh toroid anvils including but not limited to those discussed in Khvostantsev L. G. Vereshchagin L. F. and Novikov A. P. Device of toroid type for high pressure generation High Temperatures High Pressures 1977 vol. 9 pp 637 638.

In another embodiment the present invention is directed to an ultratough single crystal CVD diamond that is laser inscribed with identifying marks e.g. name date number and a method of preparing such a diamond. The identifying marks can be laser inscribed onto a diamond substrate prior to starting the CVD process to prepare a single crystal diamond. The mark is transferred to the single crystal diamond through this process.

As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof it should also be understood that the above described embodiments are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description unless otherwise specified but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds of the claims or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.
