title: Analyzing tabular structures in expression recognition
abstract: A mechanism for recognizing and inputting handwritten mathematical expressions into a computer by providing part of a multi-path framework is described. The part of the multi-path framework is tabular structure analysis component that is designed to determine tabular structures, such as ones defined by brackets, within handwritten mathematical expressions. A method for determining tabular structures in a handwritten mathematical expression includes determining whether a symbol representative of input strokes corresponds to a tabular structure associated with a mathematical expression. The tabular structure may be a matrix or multi-line expression. The method includes dividing input strokes into rows and columns and determining the existence of one or more brackets that define a tabular structure.
