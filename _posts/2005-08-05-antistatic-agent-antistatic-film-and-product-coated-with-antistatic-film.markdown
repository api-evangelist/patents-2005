This is an application filed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Section 111 a with claiming the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 60 600 777 filed Aug. 12 2004 under the provision of 35 U.S.C. 111 b pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Section 119 e 1 .

The present invention relates to an antistatic agent. More specifically the present invention relates to an antistatic agent capable of effectively preventing a film thinning phenomenon in chemically amplified resist film used as material in electronic industry an antistatic film using the antistatic agent and a product coated with the antistatic film.

A self doping type electroconductive polymer is usually soluble in water and therefore can be easily formed into an arbitrary shape or formed into a film which characteristic enables easy production of large area film. Moreover such a polymer also exhibits an extremely excellent formability in electric devices which require microscopic processing and therefore has been widely used these days.

On the other hand a chemically amplified resist has been an essential material technically common in lithography using light or charged particle radiation such as electron beam or ion beam. However such a resist is susceptible to use environment and is known as a resist hard to handle. Especially positive chemically amplified resist is even harder to handle and it involves a concern over adverse effects by water soluble coating material.

In a case where the resist is coated with a water soluble coating material there has been a problem that acid generated through exposure to light is neutralized by the coating material when the hydrogen ion concentration hereinafter abbreviated as pH thereof falls in a certain range or that even without exposure process acid supplied from the coating material forms the same situation as in the case where the resist is exposed to light. Thus since a trace amount of acid in the coating material greatly affects sensitivity of the resist the pH value of the coating material solution is important. Such a problem occurs as film thinning phenomenon in a positive type resist while it occurs as formation of hardly soluble layer or insoluble layer in a negative type resist.

As methods for preventing the phenomenons a method where pH decrease is controlled by using a buffer solution containing a weak acid and an amine JP A H11 189746 a method using a composition containing a fluorinated aliphatic sulfonic acid or a fluorinated aliphatic carboxylic acid JP A 2003 29410 and the like have been proposed.

Also a film of a composition containing a water soluble electroconductive polymer a vinyl base polymer emulsion and a nonionic surfactant which has excellent storage stability has been disclosed JP A H11 185523 .

In recent years under circumstances where resists patterned in accordance with miniaturization of the smallest circuit line width in semiconductor devices tend to easily collapse attempts to make aspect ratio of resist pattern appropriate are being made in order to prevent the phenomenon and therefore resist film thickness is with a tendency to be reduced. After a resist pattern has undergone developing process the pattern is transcribed onto a substrate through dry etching process.

In this process the importance of dry etching resistance of resists is growing and since changes in resist form attributable to antistatic films have a great influence on pattern printing the demand for maintaining performances of resists is growing keener and keener.

The object of the present invention is to provide an antistatic agent exhibiting an excellent property of preventing film thinning phenomenon in chemically amplified resists an antistatic film using the antistatic agent and a product coated therewith.

As a result of intensive studies the present inventors have found out that specific biosurfactants are adsorbed to water soluble electroconductive polymer to thereby form a micellar structure and that the giant micellar molecules generated therein can inhibit permeation of the polymer into chemically amplified resist. Based on the findings the inventors have completed the present invention.

The antistatic agent of the present invention is a composition which contains a water soluble electroconductive polymer and a biosurfactant having a hydrophilic site of a molecular weight of 200 to 10 000.

Further the composition of the present invention may be a solution which further contains a solvent. Furthermore the solution may further contain an aromatic sulfonic acid substituted with an alkyl or alkenyl group.

When the antistatic agent of the present invention is applied onto an article and then left standing or dried the solvent contained in the antistatic agent decreases through volatilization or the like making the agent semisolid or solid without fluidity. The agent in such a state having no fluidity is called antistatic material and when the material has a film shape it is called antistatic film .

The term biosurfactant used in the present invention is a collective term for surface active substances produced by living organisms such as microorganisms and is described in detail in Kinouseikaimenkasseizai Functional Surfactants p.p. 122 133 CMC publishing Co. Ltd.

Examples of microorganisms producing biosurfactants used in the present invention include bacteria such as and and particularly preferred among these is

The hydrophilic site the biosurfactant used in the present invention has has a molecular weight of 200 to 10 000 preferably 500 to 5 000. If the molecular weight of the hydrophilic site is less than 200 biosurfactant permeates the resist and film thinning cannot be prevented. On the other hand if the molecular weight exceeds 10 000 adsorption of biosurfactant to water soluble electroconductive polymer is inhibited which is not preferred.

In the present invention it is preferable that the biosurfactant have a polypeptide structure and more preferable that the polypeptide structure be a cyclic structure.

In the present invention the hydrophilic site contained in the biosurfactant is a portion constituting a polypeptide structure consisting of amino acid residues. The polypeptide structure may be a polypeptide structure substituted with an ester of a carboxylic acid a sulfonic acid or a phosphoric acid via a carboxylic acid group a hydroxyl group or a sulfonic acid group.

In the present invention the lipophilic group contained in the biosurfactant consists of lipid represented by fatty acid unsaturated fatty acid hydroxy fatty acid steroid terpenoid or the like.

In the present invention examples of biosurfactant having a polypeptide structure include surfactin iturin plipastatin arthrofactin serrawettin and straight chain surfactin. Among these surfactin having a cyclic polypeptide structure and iturin are preferred. One of these biosurfactants may be used singly or a mixture of two or more of them may be used.

In the present invention the biosurfactant is adsorbed to the later described water soluble electroconductive polymer to form a micellar structure and the water soluble electroconductive polymer forms light scattering particles apparently large. Thus permeation of the water soluble electroconductive polymer into chemically amplified resist is inhibited to thereby control film thinning and fogging of the resist.

In the present invention it is preferable that the light scattering particle contained in the antistatic agent have a particle size of 0.05 to 10 m. Particularly in a case where the agent is applied onto a chemically amplified resist in order to obtain performance as desired when charged particle beam is irradiated the charged particle beam must penetrate through the antistatically treated film to reach the resist. Therefore it is preferable that the particle size distribution of the particles of a particle size of 0.05 to 10 m be 50 to 99.9 .

For the purpose of generating the light scattering particles it is preferable that the addition amount of the biosurfactant be 0.001 to 10 times by mass based on the water soluble electroconductive polymer. In order to generate light scattering particles of large size it is preferable that the addition ratio be 0.1 times by mass or more.

In order for the biosurfactant to be adsorbed to the water soluble electroconductive polymer to cover the surface of the polymer the biosurfactant concentration required depends on the chemical structure of the water soluble electroconductive polymer and cannot be flatly defined however the preferred concentration is usually 0.1 to 10 000 ppm and particularly preferred is a concentration of 1 to 1 000 ppm.

In a case where light scattering particles with a large size may exist without any problem it is preferable that the biosurfactant concentration be in a range of 1 000 to 10 000 ppm.

In the present invention solubility of the biosurfactant in the solvent is greatly influenced by the pH and the solubility can be particularly high in a pH range of from mild acid and neutral to weakly basic so that a desired concentration may be prepared in such a pH region. In the present invention the preferable pH value of the antistatic agent is from 2 to 11 particularly preferably 3 to 7 in consideration for application to a chemically amplified resist.

In a strong acid region of less than pH 2 the biosurfactant separates out failing to be dissolved to achieve a concentration required to exhibit its surface action effect so that little surface action effect can be obtained. On the other hand in a alkali region of more than pH 11 hydrolysis of weak bonding sites such as ester bond contained in the biosurfactant proceeds which is not preferred.

The biosurfactant used in the present invention may be used in combination with other surfactants. By using other surfactants in combination with the biosurfactant not only film thinning phenomenon and changes in resist shape can be inhibited but also coatability onto the resist surface can be improved. Examples of surfactants particularly preferably used in combination with the biosurfactant include an aromatic sulfonic acid substituted with an alkyl group or alkenyl group. Examples of aromatic sulfonic acid include alkyl benzenesulfonic acid alkyl naphthalenesulfonic acid alkyl quinolinesulfonic acid alkyl anthraquinone sulfonic acid and salts thereof. Examples of alkyl group include straight chain or branched octyl nonyl decyl undecyl dodecyl tridecyl tetradecyl pentadecyl hexadecyl and heptadecyl and examples of alkenyl group include octenyl decynyl undecynyl dodecynyl tridecynyl tetradecynyl and pentadecynyl hexadecynyl heptadecynyl and octadecynyl.

In a case where the biosurfactant and the above aromatic sulfonic acid are used in combination the ratio of the biosurfactant concentration aromatic sulfonic acid concentration hereinafter abbreviated as M is preferable within a range of 0.001 to 5. When M exceeds 5 film thinning phenomenon becomes prominent and the combinational use of the surfactants is not effective for a chemically amplified resist in such a case.

In the present invention in addition to the biosurfactant and the aromatic sulfonic acid substituted with an alkyl or alkenyl group other surfactants may by used together.

The surfactant usable in combination is not particularly limited however examples of anionic surfactant include alkyl ether carboxylic acid dialkyl sulfosuccinic acid polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfuric acid ester polyoxyethylene alkylphenylether sulfuric acid ester higher alcohol phosphoric acid ester higher alcohol ethylene oxide adduct phosphoric acid ester and acyl N methyl taurine and in case of acid type salts thereof may also be used.

Further other than above various high molecular weight surfactants and high molecular weight base dispersants phosphatide lecithin and the like fluorine base surfactants and silicone base surfactants can be used.

The molecular weight of the water soluble electroconductive polymer used in the present invention is if expressed in terms of the number of repeating units constituting the main chain polymerization degree usually from 5 to 2000 preferably from 10 to 1000.

Particularly preferable examples of the water soluble electroconductive polymer used in the present invention include polymer of 5 sulfoisothianaphthene 1 3 diyl random copolymer containing 80 mol or more of 5 sulfoisothianaphthene poly 5 sulfoisothianaphthene 1 3 diyl co isothianaphthene 1 3 diyl poly 3 3 thienyl ethanesulfonic acid poly 3 3 thienyl propanesulfonic acid poly 2 3 thienyl oxyethanesulfonic acid random copolymer containing 50 mol or more of 2 sulfo 1 4 iminophenylene poly 2 sulfo 1 4 iminophenylene co 1 4 iminophenylene and lithium salt sodium salt ammonium salt and triethylammonium salt thereof.

The concentration of the water soluble electroconductive polymer in the present invention depends on the antistatic performance of the film as desired. However it is usually from 0.001 to 30 mass preferably from 0.01 to 10 mass .

Further in the antistatic agent of the present invention solvent which is miscible with water and can dissolve water soluble electroconductive polymer without dedoping it may be used. Examples of the solvent include ethers such as 1 4 dioxane and tetrahydrofuran carbonates such as dimethyl carbonate diethyl carbonate ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate nitrites such as acetonitrile and benzonitrile alcohols such as methanol ethanol propanol and isopropanol aprotic solvents such as N N dimethylformamide dimethylsulfoxide and N methyl 2 pyrrolidone inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid and organic acids such as acetic acid. One of these solvents may be used singly or a mixture solvent of two or more of them may be used.

As a preferable example of the composition of the antistatic agent of the present invention a composition where water soluble electroconductive polymer from 0.1 to 20 mass biosurfactant 0.0001 to 1 mass and solvent from 79 to 99.8 mass are contained is mentioned.

As an example of the antistatic agent containing other surfactants a composition of water soluble electroconductive polymer from 0.1 to 20 mass biosurfactant from 0.0001 to 1 mass an aromatic sulfonic acid substituted with an alkyl or alkenyl group from 0.0001 to 0.2 mass and solvent from 78.8 to 99.8 mass is mentioned. If the concentration of the biosurfactant is less than 0.0001 mass little surface active effect is obtained while if it exceeds 1 mass no increase in surface active effect commensurate with the excessive amount of the biosurfactant is obtained.

The antistatic agent of the present invention can be used with whichever of a non chemically amplified resist and a chemically amplified resist.

In a non chemically amplified resist the antistatic agent of the present invention is effective as antistatic treatment agent having an excellent coatability. Examples of non chemically amplified resist include phenol resins such as novolak resin acrylic resins such as polymethylacrylate resin and polyacrylate resin and copolymer types of methylstyrene and chloroacrylic acid.

In a chemically amplified resist more effective prevention of formation of a mixture layer in the contacting interface between the antistatic film and the resist is observed. Examples of chemically amplified resist include photosensitive resins such as phenol resin types acrylic resin types and azide compound types and resins sensitive to electrically charged particles such as polymethacrylate resin types polyvinylphenol types polyhydroxystyrene types and copolymer types of methyl styrene and chloroacrylic acid.

Further additives such as photosensitizing agent azide compound crosslinking agent dissolution inhibitor and acid generator may be added to the resist.

The pH of the antistatic agent of the present invention can be adjusted to an arbitrary pH value within a range of acid to alkaline by controlling the amine addition amount used for neutralizing the Bronsted acid of the water soluble electroconductive polymer contained in the solution.

The antistatic agent of the present invention is applied onto the resist surface to form an antistatic film. As a method for coating the resist surface with the antistatic agent spin coating is preferably employed however other methods for example dipping method spraying method and bar coater method may also be employed. After coating an antistatic film is formed by air drying at room temperature or heating the base substrate having the coated resist film on a hot plate. Also heating treatment in inert gas atmosphere is preferable in light of removal of solvent.

After coating with the antistatic agent in the process for forming an antistatic film on the resist film if the resist contains residue of solvent having a high affinity with water liquid components from the two layers permeate each other. The permeation of liquid components is accompanied by transfer of water soluble electroconductive polymer and therefore a mixture layer is formed in the interface between the resist and the antistatic film. If the acid concentration derived from the electroconductive polymer exceeds the concentration for inducing chemical changes in the resist it leads to film thinning phenomenon in a case where a positive type chemically amplified resist is used.

On the other hand in case of using a negative type chemically amplified resist solvent residue leads to formation of insolubilized layer and further to fogging phenomenon. Through such a chemical reaction in the interface T topping or bowing occurs in the resist. Such a change in the form causes line width changes or adversely affects control of etching depth and form during the process where the pattern is printed onto a substrate such as a silicon wafer.

Examples of product coated with the antistatic film of the present invention include a substrate having the antistatic film and a resist film laminated thereon. Examples of material for the substrate include silicon wafer compound semiconductor wafers such as gallium arsenide wafer and indium phosphorus wafer a quartz substrate and a magnetic material substrate.

Products according to the present invention include substrates which are temporarily involved in production process for semiconductor photomask reticle stencil mask or the like.

Since the antistatic agent of the present invention causes no quality changes such as fogging film thinning and form changes including T topping or bowing when applied onto a chemically amplified resist to form an antistatic film the present invention enables precise pattern formation and also the antistatic effect of the present inventor prevents positioning errors in etching step using charged particle beam.

With respect to resists there is a film thinning amount D specific to each kind of resist and depending on the length of storage time after formation of the resist coating film. The amount D of film thinning which the antistatic film is not responsible for was measured in advance by the following procedures.

In Examples 1 to 8 and Comparative Example 1 a positive chemically amplified resist FEP171 manufactured by FUJIFILM Arch Co.

In the present invention it is preferable that the value obtained by the equation film thinning amount C reference film thinning amount D be less than 10 nm more preferably less than 3 nm.

In order to evaluate coatability of the antistatic agent for the surface of the resist film formed on the silicon wafer the contact angle was measured. The contact angle was measured by forming a liquid drop of the antistatic agent having a diameter of about 30 m at the end of an injection needle and contacting the drop onto the resist film surface to be adsorbed and detecting the contact angle by placing a tangent line to the liquid drop surface 20 seconds after the adsorption.
