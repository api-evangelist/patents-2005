title: Contoured rudder maneuvering of waterjet propelled sea craft
abstract: The stern hull portion of a surface ship or underwater sea craft is provided with a waterjet propulsion unit having an outlet end from which a discharge propelling waterjet emerges underwater and undergoes flow beyond the stern end of the hull between a pair of twin contoured rudders normally positioned for straight forward propulsion of the hull. The contoured rudders pivotally mounted underwater on the hull are angularly displaced by maneuvering control in opposite directions from the normal positions to maneuvering positions with their lower end tips in contact with each other to form a bucket to directionally change flow of the emerging waterjet for steering, deceleration and backing purposes during hull propulsion between low and high speeds. The twin rudders are also angularly displaced by the maneuvering control in the same angular direction for a different directionally regulated change in waterjet flow to effect turning of the hull for propulsion in a reverse direction.

Currently ships or sea vessels that are commercially utilized in the marine industry and U.S. Navy are propelled by waterjets discharged into the air above the seawater surface. Such air discharged jets undergo plumbing into the water to create undesirable impact noise and generate bubble spray or clouds which hinder visibility and splash water onto neighboring sea craft and docking piers being approached. Furthermore maneuvering of waterjet propelled sea craft routinely involve use of rotating steering sleeves or buckets for steering backing vectored deflection of the propulsion jets within air so as to avoid severe drag and broadband noise experienced with underwater propulsion jets. Moreover the bulkiness of the aforementioned rotating sleeves trigger severe undesirable cavitation. It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide for waterjet propulsion and maneuvering of both surface and submerged sea craft by waterjet discharge underwater without the problems and disadvantages associated therewith and the bulkiness of associated operational equipment heretofore experienced with air discharging water jet propulsors.

Pursuant to the present invention a surface or submerged sea craft is propelled by a waterjet unit positioned on the sea craft hull for underwater discharge of a water propulsion jet between a pair of contoured rudders that are pivotally mounted on the hull for angular displacement from parallel spaced positions accommodating straight forward and cavitation free propulsion of the sea craft by emergence of the waterjet between the rudders. Displacement of the rudders to positions in contact with each other at their lower tips to form a closed bucket or to low and high speed turn imposing positions extending angularly in the same direction from the hull centerline is effected for steering and backing of the sea craft under maneuvering control.

Referring now to the drawing in detail and illustrate a surface sea vessel having a hull immersed in seawater and extending vertically above the water surface during normal forward travel. A waterjet propulsion unit is positioned underwater on a bottom portion of the hull closely spaced from its stern end . A pair of twin contoured rudders are also locationally positioned on the bottom of the hull between the stern end and the waterjet propulsion unit .

As shown in and each of the rudders respectively extends vertically downward in spaced adjacency to the stern end from the bottom of the hull for angular adjustment about parallel spaced axes as denoted in under maneuvering control as hereinafter explained. Each of the rudders as shown in has a horizontal dimension of 9.4 feet for example. Lower portions of the rudders extend toward each other at an acute angle from their longer top vertical portions as shown in . The rudders are so configured on opposite lateral sides of an underwater positioned exit jet nozzle of the propulsion unit . Accordingly propulsion jets emerging from the exit nozzle pass between the rudders as shown in .

Referring now to outflow of the emerging propulsion jets from the exit nozzle of the propulsion unit is induced by rotation of an impeller by a motor connected to the impeller by an impeller pump shaft . Primary propulsion of the sea vessel is thereby effected in response to inflow of seawater into an inlet end of the propulsion unit induced by rotation of the impeller . Typically the exit speed of the propulsion jets is about 60 higher than the speed of the sea vessel when the rudders are in straight ahead positions aligned with the outflow exit jets as shown in .

The rudders under maneuvering control diagrammed in are angularly displaced about their axes into closure contact with each other at their lower tips so as to form a bucket as shown in . The main portion of the jet stream is thereby diverted to the lateral sides in a reversed forward flow direction toward the bow end of the hull to impose negative thrust. The remaining smaller portions of the jet stream move upwardly along the top portions of the rudders and are then diverted forwardly toward the bow end of the hull for also producing negative thrust. The total negative thrust produced by the rudders in their bucket closure positions shown in is substantially larger such as 4.79 times greater than the forward propulsion thrust produced during normal forward propelling operation for emergency stopping deceleration or backing purposes.

A tight turn of the sea vessel is effected by the maneuvering control imparting angular displacement to the rudders by 35 in the same direction to positions with the leading edge of only one of the two rudders in the jet stream as shown in . Due to the high jet stream velocity the side turning force thereby imposed on the hull is greatly increased by a significant amount. Such increased side turning capacity of the rudders is accordingly effective to turn the sea vessel even during forward propulsion at low speeds. Furthermore during the straight and level course operation of the rudders as shown in reduced drag and less broadband noise is imposed.

The maneuvering concepts associated with the rudders as hereinbefore described are also applicable to a fully submerged underwater sea vessel hull as shown in having a stern end on its centerline . A waterjet propulsion pump unit associated with the hull is located in forwardly spaced relation to a pair of twin rudders positioned along the centerline . The rudders are contoured similarly to the rudders as hereinbefore described. A curved water inflow inlet on the outer peripheral surface of the hull directs inflow of water into an annular enclosure within the propulsion unit from which a curved outflow exit nozzle extends. Accordingly the outflowing water propulsion jets emerging from the exit nozzle pass between the rudders contoured and subject to maneuvering angular displacement as hereinbefore described with respect to the rudders .

Obviously other modifications and variations of the present invention may be possible in light of the foregoing teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
