The present application claims priority from Japanese application JP2004 123631 filed on 20 Apr. 2004 the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.

The present invention relates generally to digital broadcast receiving devices capable of recording and reproducing broadcast programs.

In recent years television TV broadcasting is promoted to shift from analog to digital schemes in countries around the world. In Japan also communications satellite CS and broadcasting satellite BS broadcast services relying upon digital technologies have already commenced in addition digital terrestrial broadcasting services have also started in selected areas.

A feature of the domestic digital terrestrial broadcast in Japan is that the orthogonal frequency division multiplex OFDM technique is used as its transmission scheme to thereby enable achievement of not only fixed reception but also mobile cellular reception while offering the capability to establish hierarchical transmission up to three graded classes or layers in maximum. With the use of such hierarchized transmission it becomes possible to provide broadcast services with mutual synchronization between mobile reception directed broadcast strong hierarchical layer and fixed reception aimed broadcast weak layer . An example thereof is disclosed for example in ARIB TR14 Version 1.5 OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR DIGITAL TERRESTRIAL TELEVISION BROADCASTING Section 7 Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcast Delivery Handling Rules Oct. 16 2003 .

Techniques for receiving the broadcast that uses such the hierarchical transmission are known one of which is disclosed for example in JP A 2000 165766 page 5 FIG. 1 .

Additionally in the background of cost reduction and storage capacity increase of hard disk drive HDD units there is known a technique for using a digital broadcast receiver with built in HDD to record and reproduce digital broadcast contents directly in the format of MPEG2 TS which stands for moving pictures experts group phase two transport stream. For detail see JP A 2003 9085 page 17 FIG. 1 .

Unfortunately prior known digital broadcast receivers with built in HDDs suffer from problems which follow. Typically the HDD embedded digital broadcast receivers are such that when digital broadcast is being received by a handheld terminal or a mobile movable body such as a land vehicle or the like the reception quality can decrease resulting in occurrence of errors in a received stream although digital terrestrial broadcast is designed to employ specific schemes and techniques that take account of mobile movable body reception such as the OFDM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplizing technology and frequency time interleave techniques. This in turn causes the digital broadcast reception by means of mobile movable bodies to experience an appreciable variation in reception quality due to any possible phasing multi path or carrier to noise C N deterioration or else. Once the reception quality significantly deteriorates error correction becomes impossible resulting in errors taking place in the received stream.

In this way in the case of receiving the broadcast using the hierarchical transmission in the state that the reception quality is greatly reduced it is possible to provide good reception by changing or switching from a weak hierarchical class or layer to a strong layer. An approach to determining the timing for performing such switching operation is disclosed for example in JP A 2000 165766 page 5 FIG. 1 which teaches that the reception quality of an input signal is judged by detection of a with time variation amount of the input signal characteristics at a front end unit such as an electric field strength carrier to noise C N value or bit error rate BER followed by an attempt to switch to an optimal reception hierarchy layer. With this approach it is possible in the case of receiving hierarchically transmitted digital terrestrial broadcast via handheld terminals or mobile movable bodies such as auto cars or else to play back and display video images and audio voice sounds with excellent reception quality.

However the above noted conventional receivers are faced with a problem which follows. When recording a received stream to an HDD and reproducing the same any successful playback and visual display are no longer possible because of the following fact for example in order to record streams of a weak hierarchical layer and of a strong layer simultaneously and then reproduce this stream the timing for switching between hierarchical layers in the state that the reception quality during recording is extremely deteriorated is kept unknown.

This is resulted from the fact that as has been explained above the traditional receivers are merely designed so that the hierarchy switch timing is determined by utilization of the detection result of a with time variation amount of the input signal characteristics at the front end unit. More specifically the input signal characteristics have been detected through measurement of the electric field strength C N value or BER of an input signal at the front end unit. On the contrary the stream to be recorded to HDD is an output of the front end unit practically an MPEG TS stream. By reproducing this stream it is impossible to measure the electric field strength C N value or BER in the way of the prior art. This results in the hierarchy switch timing becoming unknown which leads to the lack of an ability to perform successful playback and display operations.

The present invention has been made in view of such the circumstances and relates to providing a digital broadcast receiving device capable of performing reproduction equivalent in quality to that during recording sessions in the case of receiving digital broadcast by handheld terminals or mobile movable bodies such as land vehicles and recording it to a storage device s and then reproducing the same.

To attain the foregoing object an arrangement is employed which comprises a reception means for receiving and demodulating a digital broadcast signal being transmitted while dividing more than two image signals or audio signals into different hierarchical classes or layers within the same transmission channel an analysis means for analyzing the digital broadcast signal received at the reception means and a record reproduction means for recording in the form of a data stream the image signals or audio signals as received at the reception means and for reproducing the same. The record reproduction means is operable based on information concerning the reception quality that was analyzed at the analysis means and management information correlated with the data stream recorded to the recording means to reproduce an image or audio signal of the image or audio signals being divided into a plurality of hierarchical classes and being included in the recorded data stream wherein the image or audio signal is at either one of the hierarchical layers.

According to this invention in the digital broadcast receiver device it becomes possible to achieve excellent reproduction of recorded television programs.

Other objects features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Currently preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings below. Although this invention is related in particular to a recorder embedded digital broadcast receiving device for use with mobile movable bodies while enabling recording of broadcast programs by handheld terminals or mobile movable bodies such as land vehicles the invention should not exclusively be limited to such equipment for the mobile and in vehicle use and recorder embedded digital broadcast receiver devices and may also be applied to other digital broadcast receiver devices of the stationary type and those with no built in recorders.

In the explanation below the term hierarchical transmission is used to mean certain cases where more than two image and or audio Elementary Streams ES are being transmitted within the same transmission channel while allowing each ES to be sent with a different transmission path coding modulation processing applied thereto.

In the digital broadcast receiver device includes a tuner a transmission path demodulation unit a separation unit for example demultiplexer a reception quality analysis unit a list generation unit a writing unit a recording medium e.g. a hard disk or a memory or an optical disk a readout unit a list analysis unit a selection instruction unit a control unit e.g. central processing unit or CPU and a system bus unit . The digital broadcast receiver also includes a demodulation unit e.g. an MPEG decoder and a user interface unit for example a key board or mouse or remote commander for use as an input device a display device using a cathode ray tube CRT or liquid crystal display LCD or plasma display panel PDP for use as an output device and a speaker device .

The tuner receives a digital broadcast signal via broadcast transmission networks such as satellite or ground or cable links from a digital broadcasting source from a broadcast station not shown and then applies tuning and demodulation processing to the frequency of a channel that was designated via a user operation unit such as a remote commander of the user interface unit and the control unit and thereafter outputs it to the transmission path demodulator unit .

The transmission path demodulator outputs to the separator unit the resultant MPEG2 TS obtained after execution of the digital demodulation and error correction processing with respect to the signal from the tuner which has been applied the tuning and demodulation processing. On the other hand the transmission path demodulator outputs to the reception quality analyzer unit both the hierarchy number information at the time of hierarchical transmission and the information concerning the electric field strength carrier to noise C N value bit error rate BER or error indicator data of a received stream during the digital demodulation and error correction operations.

While the digital broadcast employs for information distribution a transport stream which is standardized by a MPEG system the transport stream is made up of transport packets each having a fixed length of 188 bytes. The transport packet is arranged so that the initial 1 byte is a synchronization byte and the next 1 byte indicates an error indicator error indication . This indicates whether an error is present or absent in the packet. If a non correctable error is found during the error correction processing then the error indicator is set to 1 at the transmission path demodulator if no errors are found then set at 0 . The error indicator information refers to the information of the above noted error indicator.

The reception quality analyzer determines or judges the reception quality based on the hierarchy number information from the transmission path demodulator and the electric field strength C N value BER or error indicator information and then outputs such information to the list generator .

The separator unit separates or splits from the input MPEG2 TS a plurality of transport packets of the channel that was designated via the user operation unit of the user interface such as a remote commander and the control unit and then outputs the separated multiple transport packets to the writing unit while extracting a Packetized Elementary Stream PES or Elementary Stream ES from plural transport packets of the channel that was designated via the user operation unit of the user interface such as the remote commander and the control unit to thereby output it to the demodulator unit .

The demodulator demodulates the PES or ES of a video image and or audio from the separator causing the image and or audio thus demodulated to be output to the user interface unit . The user interface visually displays and or reproduces the demodulated image and or audio at the display device and or the speaker device each of which is an output device.

The list generator prepares a position information list based on the information from the writing unit to be later described and also prepares a reception quality list based on the reception quality information from the reception quality analyzer for output to the writing unit .

The writing unit performs recording processing of the transport packets separated at the separator onto the recording medium and also outputs to the list generator the information used for list preparation at the recording medium . In addition the writing unit records on the recording medium the position information list generated at the list generator along with the reception quality list.

The position information list is the information that indicates what kind of information is recorded on the recording medium at what position thereof. Additionally the information for list preparation is such that in case the writing unit records those transport packets of image data on the record medium by way of example the list makeup information involves position information indicating by means of a transfer byte number of the data from a sequence header being placed at the top at the time of recording startup a position of the sequence header that is a group unit for execution of moving picture compression of video data and or group of pictures GOP or intra I picture. The information also contains time information indicative of a system time clock STC count value at the time of recording each GOP and or I picture.

It is permissible to add packet identifier PID information to the position information list. Whereby it is possible to manage the position of every image data on the recording medium even when recording on the recording medium a transport stream with a plurality of image data multiplexed together for example. Thus it is possible to identify and distinguish any desired image data which in turn makes it possible to effectively perform reproduction such as special playback or else.

The reception quality list is a list which is prepared by use of information indicating a level at which the reception quality is set when recording a received digital broadcast signal on the recording medium time information that is the information for preparation of the above noted list from the writing unit and a hierarchy number at the time of hierarchical transmission.

The readout unit first reads the position information list and the reception quality list out of the recording medium and outputs them to the list analyzer unit .

The list analyzer searches for the record location of a desired transport packet based on the position information list and causes the readout unit to sequentially read desired transport packets out of the recording medium and then controls the read transport packets to be output to the separator unit . By performing the readout processing using the position information list in this way it is possible to conduct a search in units of compressed motion picture groups of the video image data. This makes it possible to perform special reproduction efficiently. In addition it becomes possible to calculate during normal playback and special playback sessions a playback time period and a remaining playback time in the stream. Thus it becomes possible to notify a user of a present playback time and a time assumed to be taken up to the completion of a playback program. On the other hand the list analyzer unit analyzes the reception quality of the data being presently reproduced based on the reception quality list i.e. data being read out of the recording medium and then outputs its resulting reception quality information to the selection instruction unit .

The selection instructor unit controls the separator and or the demodulator based on the reception quality information from the list analyzer . For example the selection instructor controls the separator and or demodulator in such a way as to separate and or demodulate a transport packet that was transferred by a weak hierarchical layer in case the reception quality information from the list analyzer is of the reception quality 0 or a transport packet as sent forth by a strong layer in case the reception quality stays at 1. 

The control unit executes various kinds of processing tasks by controlling an operation of the entirety of the digital broadcast receiver device and also receiving various types of command signals from the user via the remote commander or else of the user interface unit to thereby control based such command signals a block which is connected through the system bus unit .

Here an explanation will be given of the hierarchical transmission with reference to . shows a transmission spectrum of a certain broadcasting scheme for example the digital terrestrial broadcast system known as Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Terrestrial ISDB T of Japan in case its hierarchy number is set at two layers i.e. a stationary reception directed layer plus mobile reception directed layer . A hierarchical layer is assigned to twelve segments while a layer is to one segment. For example the layer B is designed to employ a modulation scheme of what is called the sixty four quadrature amplitude modulation 64 QAM with its internal code encoding ratio of 3 4 wherein a C N value required is high but its transmission capacity also becomes greater thereby enabling successful signal reception at the time of good reception quality. Regarding the hierarchical layer A this uses a modulation scheme of the so called quaternary phase shift keying QPSK technique with its internal code encoding ratio of 1 2 wherein the C N value required is low but the transmission capacity also becomes less thereby enabling signal reception not only in good reception quality events but also in bad reception quality events.

An explanation will next be given of a system routine of the reception quality list preparation processing to be performed by the list generator unit with reference to a flow chart of .

Upon start up of a television program recording session the reception quality analyzer unit acquires from the transmission path demodulator the data indicative of a total hierarchy number of the hierarchical transmission at step S of electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information at step S . Thereafter the reception quality analyzer evaluates the reception quality from the electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information step S . An example is that in case the total hierarchy number is two and indicates the presence of a couple of graded classes or layers consisting of a weak layer and a strong layer the analyzer evaluates the reception quality as 0 when the reception quality is good and the electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information ensure weak layer signal receivability such as in the state that a movable body remains stationary. Alternatively the analyzer evaluates the reception quality as 1 when the movable body begins to move or when it remains stationary while the reception quality decreases due to a change in reception ambient environment resulting in the electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information permitting signal reception of the strong hierarchical layer although indicating that weal layer reception is difficult. Further evaluate the reception quality as 2 when the electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information indicate the lack of any strong layer signal receivability such as inside of a tunnel or the like. Furthermore the reception quality analyzer acquires at step S of the time information indicative of a system time clock STC count number at the time of recording each GOP and or I picture. The list generator prepares a reception quality list based on every information of the total hierarchy number information from reception quality analyzer along with the time information and reception quality information step S . Note that if no hierarchical transmission is done then the total hierarchy number information becomes 1. 

The processing stated above is executed until the program recording is terminated. Upon such termination let the processing be completed at step S in .

Next an explanation will be given of a procedure for the reception quality analysis processing to be performed by the list analyzer unit with reference to a flowchart of .

Prior to startup of this processing the list analyzer obtains from the readout unit the position information list being recorded on the recording medium while program playback gets started based on this list. Upon startup of the broadcast program playback the list analyzer acquires from the readout unit a reception quality list being recorded on the record medium at step S . The list analyzer determines based on the hierarchy number information of such reception quality list whether the reception quality is less than or equal to N 1 where N is the total hierarchy number at step S . In case the reception quality is less than or equal to N 1 use the information within the position information list and the time information and reception quality information within the reception quality list to determine whether it is necessary or not to change the hierarchical layer from a presently reproduced layer and reception quality at a future time point from the present step S . If such the layer switching is necessary then use both the position information within the position information list and the information within the reception quality list to compare a present playback time with a layer switching time and then continue comparing until the switch time comes step S . When the switch time came the selection instruction unit controls the separator and or demodulator and or interface unit for performing hierarchical layer selection and playback plus display step S .

On the other hand in case the reception quality is N this means that no playback is executable in all the hierarchical layers. If this is the case in order to inform the user of the fact that a broadcast signal reception failure occurred during recording perform displaying at the display part of the interface unit step S . Alternatively if it is unnecessary to switch between the hierarchical layers then pass over or skip the steps S S. The processing above will be executed until the program playback is stopped. When stopped terminate the processing step S .

The above noted display for notifying the user of the occurrence of a signal receiving failure during recording at the display unit of the interface unit at the step S may be a visual indication such as shown in for example. In it is a pop up window message by means of an on screen display OSD at the display unit of the interface unit . Displaying the OSD message in this way helps the user avoid feeling uncomfortable.

In the above explanation a plurality of transport packets to be output from the separator unit to the writing unit may be partial or all transport packets of the hierarchical service in case the illustrative device is receiving digital broadcast contents being hierarchically transmitted.

It should be noted that the transport packets to be recorded on the recording medium are not exclusively limited to those separated by the tuner transmission path demodulator and separator and may alternatively be those transport packets which are input from external equipment via an IEEE 1394 interface wireless local area network LAN and the Internet or else which are not depicted herein. In this case also similar operations become possible by making a reception quality list at the time of signal reception.

Turning to there is shown in block diagram form an exemplary configuration of a digital broadcast receiver device with its built in storage output module in accordance with a second embodiment of this invention.

The configuration of this embodiment is similar in configuration to the first embodiment shown in with an insertion unit and a detection unit being added thereto and also with replacement of a reception quality analyzer unit list generation unit list analyzer unit and selection instruction unit . The other parts or components are the same as those shown in both in structure and in operation so their explanations will be eliminated while adding the same reference numerals to the same components. An explanation below will be related only to operations of the added or replaced components i.e. insertion unit detector reception quality analyzer list generator list analyzer and selection instruction unit .

The reception quality analyzer judges the reception quality based on hierarchy number information from the transmission path demodulator along with an electric field strength C N value BER or error indicator information and then outputs such information to the insertion unit .

The separator separates from an input MPEG2 TS broadcast signal a plurality of transport packets of a channel that is designated via a user operation unit of the interface such as a remote commander and a control unit and then outputs the selected plural transport packets toward the insertion unit .

The insertion unit prepares based the reception quality information from the reception quality analyzer a transport packet referred to hereinafter as reception quality packet containing therein a reception quality table and inserts it into a transport packet that was separated at the separator for output to a writing unit .

The writing unit performs processing for recording on a recording medium the transport packet in to which the reception quality packet from the insertion unit was inserted and also outputs to the list generator unit the information for preparation of the list at the recording medium . In addition the writer records on the record medium a position information list that was generated by the list generator . The position information list may be the same as that explained in the embodiment 1 stated supra.

A readout unit first reads the position information list out of the recording medium and then outputs it to the list analyzer unit . The list analyzer searches based on the position information list the record location of a desired transport packet and permits the readout unit to sequentially read desired transport packets out of the recording medium and then controls so that the read transport packets are output to the detector unit .

The detector detects the reception quality packet from those transport packets coming from the readout unit and analyzes the reception quality of the data being presently reproduced i.e. data read out of the recording medium and then outputs the resultant reception quality information to the selection instruction unit . The selection instruction unit controls the separator and or the demodulator based on the reception quality information from the list analyzer .

Additionally the reception quality packet is creatable for example by forming a reception quality table in an adaptation field or a payload of a transport packet and using as its packet identifier PID a known unique value or a certain value e.g. 0xiFFF that is out of use during recording. When using the out of use value during recording for the PID it is required to pre record such the value as a one item of the position information list by way of example. The detector performs detection based on the PID of the reception quality packet.

Next an explanation will be given of the reception quality packet insertion processing to be done by the insertion unit while referring to a flowchart of . Upon startup of the recording of a digital broadcast program the reception quality analyzer acquires from the transmission path demodulator the data indicative of a total hierarchy number of the hierarchical transmission at step S along with an electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information step S . Thereafter the reception quality analyzer evaluates the reception quality from the electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information step S . For instance in case the total hierarchy number is two and indicates the presence of two graded classes or layers consisting of a weak layer and a strong layer the analyzer evaluates the reception quality as 0 when the reception quality is good and the electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information ensures the weak layer signal receivability such as in the state that a movable body remains stationary. Alternatively the analyzer evaluates the reception quality as 1 when the movable body begins to move or when it remains stationary while the reception quality decreases due to a change in signal reception ambient environment resulting in the electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information permitting signal reception of the strong hierarchical layer. Further evaluate the reception quality as 2 when the electric field strength C N value BER and error indicator information indicate that any strong layer signal receivability is lost completely such as the inside of a tunnel or else. The insertion unit prepares a reception quality packet based on a respective one of the reception quality information and the total hierarchy number information from the reception quality analyzer at step S . Note that if no hierarchical transmission is available then the total hierarchy number information becomes 1. Further the inserter judges whether a plurality of separated transport packets coming from the separator include a time period capable of inserting the reception quality packet step S . If such insertable time period is present then insert the reception quality packet step S .

Alternatively if such insertable time period is absent then determine whether a packet insertable time period is present within a certain time e.g. 100 milliseconds at step S . If no such insertable time is still absent even after the elapse of a given length of time and then skip the step S.

The processing above will be executed until the program playback is halted. When halted let the processing be ended at step S .

An explanation will next be given of the reception quality packet detection processing to be performed by the detector with reference to a flowchart of .

Prior to startup of this processing the list analyzer obtains from the readout unit the position information list being recorded on the recording medium while program playback gets started based on this list.

Upon startup of the program playback the detector acquires from the readout unit the reception quality packet from among a plurality of transport packets being recorded on the recording medium at step S . Based on the hierarchy number information of the reception quality packet the detector determines whether the reception quality is less than or equal to N 1 in case the total hierarchy number is N at step S . If the reception quality is less than or equal to N 1 then evaluate whether hierarchy switching is necessary or not from a presently reproduced hierarchical layer and the reception quality of the reception quality packet thus acquired step S . When the hierarchy switching is necessary the selection instruction unit controls the separator and or demodulator and or interface unit in such a way as to perform hierarchy selection playback and or display step S .

On the other hand in case the reception quality is N this means that playback is impossible at every hierarchical layer. Thus perform displaying at the display unit of the interface for notifying the user of the fact that a signal receiving failure occurred during recording at step S .

Alternatively if it is unnecessary to switch between the hierarchical layers then skip the step S. The processing above will be executed until stoppage of the program playback. Upon stoppage finish the processing at step S .

The above noted displaying in order to notify the user of the occurrence of a signal receiving failure during recording at the display unit of the interface unit at the step S is a display as shown in for example. In it is a pop up message window by means of an OSD display at the display unit of the interface . Displaying such message prevents the user from having any uncomfortable feelings.

In the above explanation a plurality of transport packets to be output from the separator to the writing unit may be partial or all transport packets of the hierarchical service in case the illustrative receiver device receives digital broadcast that is being hierarchically transmitted.

It must be noted that the transport packets to be recorded on the recording medium are not exclusively limited to those separated by the tuner transfer path demodulator and separator and may alternatively be transport packets which are input from external equipment via an IEEE 1394 interface wireless LAN the Internet or else which are not depicted herein. In this case also similar operations are achievable by preparing a reception quality list at the time of signal reception.

While the above noted embodiments 1 and 2 have been explained while referring to the flowcharts of so that playback is impossible at every hierarchical layer in case an error is found in the strongest layer no appreciable programs occur as to playback of the strongest hierarchical layer insofar as certain degrees of video audio disturbances are allowed. In this case it is recommendable to notify the user of the occurrence of a signal receiving failure at the display unit of interface and the presence of a risk as to disturbance of reproduced video images and audio sounds. For example a display such as shown in is employable. In it is a message by means of OSD display on the display unit of the interface . Displaying in this way makes it possible to lighten the annoyance with respect to the user even when video images or audio sounds become disordered during playback thereof.

In addition in the reception quality evaluation step in the explanation of the flowchart of or it is preferable in case the reception quality is other than the good condition 0 to notify the user of such fact after completion of the recording. Generally visual exhibition relating to a recorded program list for indicating the program content being recorded on recordable media is well known. More specifically in such the record program list detailed contents of the programs being recorded on the record media are described. Such contents may include but not limited to a recording date and time record start time program length channel recording mode and program title. A practical example which displays the reception quality at the time of recording while letting it be correlated with these information items is shown in . In it is a record program list by means of an OSD display on the display unit of the interface while indicating them in a left side column in the forms of reception quality 0 1 x and 2 xx . For example a program with an indication of December 12 Sun PM 3 30 2 h 30 m 011 TS Winter Grand Sumo Tournament means that the reception quality becomes 2 during recording. Additionally a program of December 10 Fri AM 6 30 1 h 00 m 061 TS News means that the reception quality becomes 1 during recording. Displaying in this way makes it possible to inform the user of the during recording reception quality prior to playback of the program recorded. Thus it is possible to lighten the annoyance with respect to the user even where video images and audio sounds are distorted during playback.

It is noted that although in the embodiments 1 2 the explanation has been made while taking as an example the ISDB T standards implemented hierarchical transmission scheme of Japan the techniques of the invention may be applicable to all of the ISDB S of Japan DVB H in Europe or any hierarchically transmittable digital broadcast standards in United States China and other countries.

Also note that the above explained functions of the transmission path demodulator unit separator unit reception quality analyzer unit list generator unit list analyzer unit selection instruction unit insertion unit control unit and others are realizable by software based processing or alternatively configurable by hardware.

Although the embodiments and modified examples of the present invention have been explained above these are mere examples for explanation of this invention and should not be interpreted to limit the scope of the invention only to these embodiments and modifications. The invention is implementable even in other various types of digital broadcast receiving devices.

It should be further understood by those skilled in the art that although the foregoing description has been made on embodiments of the invention the invention is not limited thereto and various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.
