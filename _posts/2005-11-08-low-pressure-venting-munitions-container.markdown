The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the U.S. Government for U.S. Government purposes.

The invention relates in general to containers and in particular to storage containers for items such as munitions.

When exposed to unplanned stimuli heat fire ballistic fragments etc packaged munitions ammo within confined containers are at high risk of reacting violently. Proper implementation of vents on ammunition containers allow pressure relief thereby helping to maintain a controlled burn compliant with MIL STD 2105C. MIL STD 2105C contains insensitive munitions IM tests and requirements. In conjunction with other IM technologies properly vented ammo containers can comply with MIL STD 2105C requirements.

One prior art method of container venting was to replace a steel container base or sections of the container body with a low melting point plastic matrix composite. This method involved replacing the base and or sections of the container body with welded flanges screws and composite materials. These known methods are labor intensive costly and do not always result in a container that fully complies with IM standards as set forth in MIL STD 2105C.

It is an object of the invention to provide vented containers that allow the contained material to react in a non violent manner when subjected to unplanned stimuli.

It is another object of the invention to provide a container that uses the features of known non vented containers to construct a vent opening.

Still another object of the invention is to provide a vented container wherein the vent opening is formed along a seam of the container.

It is a further object of the invention to provide a vented container wherein the vent openings are sealed sufficiently to pass a three psi leak test.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a vented container wherein the vent openings expand in size as the contained material initiates.

One aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a container having at least one seam the at least one seam having a joined portion and an unjoined portion. The apparatus may further comprise a seal for sealing the unjoined portion of the seam the seal being operative to fail due to internal pressure before the remainder of the container.

In some embodiments the joined portion comprises a weld. The seal may comprise one or more of a fluid adhesive a gasket a patch and an I shaped gasket. A cover may be used to at least partially cover the seal. The seal should be effective for at least a three psi differential.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of making a container comprising rolling sheet metal joining the sheet metal along a seam interrupting the joining for a portion of the seam resuming joining along the seam and sealing the unjoined portion of the seam to form a seal that is operative to fail due to internal pressure before a remainder of the container. In some embodiments the joining step and the resuming step includes welding.

Yet another aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a container having a plurality of panels at least one of the panels having an opening formed therein and a seal for sealing the opening the seal being operative to fail due to internal pressure before a remainder of the container. The seal should be effective for at least a three psi differential. In some embodiments the at least one panel includes a seam the opening being formed in the seam.

Still another aspect of the invention is a method of making a container comprising bending sheet metal joining the sheet metal along a seam interrupting the joining for a portion of the seam resuming joining along the seam and sealing the unjoined portion of the seam to form a seal that is operative to fail due to internal pressure before a remainder of the container. The sealing step may include forming a seal that is effective to at least a three psi differential.

A further aspect of the invention is a method of making a metal container comprising forming an opening in the metal container and sealing the opening with a seal that is operative to fail due to internal pressure before a remainder of the metal container. The sealing step may include forming a seal that is effective to at least a three psi differential.

A still further aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a metal container having a plurality of panels at least one of the panels having an opening formed therein a flange disposed on an interior of the container around the opening and a cover plate disposed on an exterior of the container around the opening the cover plate being fastened to the flange the cover plate being operative to fail due to internal pressure before a remainder of the metal container. The cover plate is effective to seal the container up to at least a three psi differential.

Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a metal container having a lid and a wire attached to the metal container and operable to fix the lid in a closed position the wire being operative to fail due to internal pressure before a remainder of the metal container.

A further aspect of the invention is an apparatus comprising a metal container having a lid a plate attached to the metal container and a wire attached to the plate and operable to fix the lid in a closed position the plate being operative to fail due to internal pressure before a remainder of the metal container.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages thereof will become more apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The present invention was developed for use in containing munitions that comprise energetic materials such as explosives propellants and pyrotechnics. However the invention is equally applicable to non combat or civilian uses where containers for energetic material are used. The invention may be applied to a wide variety of ammunition and munitions containers. The invention uses low cost materials and procedures to reduce the internal container pressure when the container is subjected to unplanned stimuli.

In general the vents of the invention comprise pre opened sections for example unwelded or pre cut sections in the container that are sealed with filler material. An over patch may be added to further protect the container contents from adverse environments. The sealed pre opening allows container venting at low pressure and controls the burning rate of the enclosed energetic materials to avoid violent reactions.

Two examples of methods for making pre opened vent sections are 1 leaving portions of the container seams unjoined the container seams are normally joined along their entire length by for example welding and 2 cutting openings for example slots in the container. The size of the pre opened section depends upon the overall weight length diameter contents and specific system requirements of the container. In embodiments of the invention that use a narrow pre opened seam the length of the seam may vary for example from about 0.001 inches to about 12 inches.

Munitions containers must also comply with MIL STD 1904 specifically the leak test. To pass the leak test the pre opened vent section as well as the rest of the container must be sealed to maintain an internal pressure of 3 psi before and after rough handling. Silicone adhesive sealant and neoprene are the preferred sealing materials although other materials may be used for sealing. In some embodiments a protective cover for the seal such as a metal plate is attached with or without fasteners to the vent section on the external surface of the container. The protective cover helps to mitigate the risks of leakage long term storage and other logistics issues.

One embodiment of a method of making a vented container according to the invention comprises 1. Rolling sheet metal 2. Joining the sheet metal along a seam by for example welding 3. Interrupting the joining for a specified length along the seam 4. Resuming joining along the seam 5. Sealing the unjoined portion of the seam. 6. Completing fabrication of the container using conventional techniques.

As discussed above the opening defined between the unjoined portions must be sealed well enough to pass a 3 psi leak test. Therefore a seal is provided at the unjoined portion . When internal pressure builds up in the container the seal will fail due to the internal pressure before the remainder of the container fails.

Any one of the seals described above may be used in combination with a cover disposed on the exterior surface of the container wherein the cover at least partially covers the seal. The cover is usually made of a harder material than the materials of the seal. The cover may be made of for example a metal or plastic. The function of the cover is to protect the seal from damage. show portions of a container having a cover over the seal. The cover is attached to container using fasteners for example rivets or bolts and nuts. In the fasteners are located adjacent but not in the unjoined portion . Thus as the unjoined portion begins to separate due to internal pressure the cover will not impede expansion of the opening at the unjoined portion because the fasteners are all disposed on one side of the unjoined portion . Similarly in fasteners are disposed directly in the seam of the unjoined portion such that the cover will not impede expansion of the opening at the unjoined portion .

In some embodiments of the invention the container will store a munition shown in or some other device containing an energetic material. In other embodiments the container may store devices that are not classified as munitions such as fuzes pyrotechnic materials commercial explosive devices etc.

The invention is equally applicable to containers other than cylindrical containers. For example shows a generally rectangular container having a top ends and sides . Side includes a seam comprising joined portions and an unjoined portion . In the case of a container such as container it is preferable to locate the unjoined portion in a seam that is located in a surface that has the largest surface area. Thus it is better to have the unjoined portion located in side rather than end . The unjoined portion could be used on surface with a corresponding effect on vent performance. The larger surface area of side results in a surface that is easier to rip open as the opening in the unjoined portion expands. While the seam is shown in a vertical position in it may also be horizontal or angled. The unjoined portion may be sealed by any combination of the seals discussed above with regard to container .

Another embodiment of the invention is shown in . shows the generally rectangular container of but without the seam . Now the container includes an opening formed in the side . As discussed above with regard to seam it is preferable for opening to be in a surface with a large surface area. The opening is not an unjoined portion of a seam but is a cutout in the side . One preferred shape shown in is that of an arc. When using the arc shaped opening the flap of material located inside the arc is especially likely to deform outward and help rip the side of the container . The opening may be sealed by any combination of the seals discussed above with regard to container . Sealed openings like may be added to other areas of the container.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
