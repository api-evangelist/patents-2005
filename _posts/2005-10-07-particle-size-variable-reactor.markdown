This application is a divisional of application Ser. No. 10 103 832 filled Mar. 25 2002 now abandoned.

The present invention relates to a highly biodegradable and less harmful particle size or particle diameter variable reactor that can specifically capture a target and has a particle size flow rate capturing reaction rate and ability to pass through a filter membrane which are adjustable. The inventive particle size variable reactor can be used in various fields.

Devices which can specifically act on and thus selectively capture a particular target alone have been developed and utilized in various fields including medical and industrial fields.

Today however because of recent increasing public interest in environmental pollution a nature friendly device is now demanded which can selectively capture a particular target in an aqueous and or oil phase and produce highly biodegradable and less harmful waste materials including the object captured.

In order to solve the above described problems associated with the prior art an object of the present invention is to provide a highly biodegradable and less harmful particle size or particle diameter variable reactor that can specifically act on and selectively capture an object to be captured which can be preferably used in various fields including medical and industrial fields.

The particle size or particle diameter variable reactor according to the present invention comprises a granular substrate and a capturing unit fixed onto the surface of the granular substrate.

The capturing unit comprises a rod shaped body a configuration variable element and a capturing structured body.

The above described rod shaped body may be any rod shaped material which can suitably be selected depending on a particular purpose including inorganic and organic rod shaped bodies and preferably organic rod shaped bodies.

Examples of biopolymers preferably include fibrous proteins helix polypeptides and nucleic acids DNA RNA etc. . Fibrous proteins include those having an helix structure such as keratin myosin epidermin fibrinogen tropomyosin silk fibroin or the like. A preferable example of polysaccharide is amylose.

Preferable examples of organic rod shaped bodies are those having a helix structure in the molecule since they can stably keep their rod shaped structures and intercalate other substance or substances of interest therein when desirable including helix polypeptides DNAs and amylose among those described above.

The above described helix polypeptides are polypeptides having a certain type of secondary structure in which every 3.6 amino acids form one coil and an imide group NH and a carbonyl group CO at every fourth amino acid in each of the two strands in the helix are bridged by a hydrogen bond which extends substantially parallel to the helix core. In this helix structure repeat subunits each consisting of 7 amino acids are linked one another to form an energy stable structure.

The above described helix polypeptide may be either dextral or sinistral. It should be noted that all of the naturally occurring helix polypeptides are dextral due to its stability.

Any amino acids which are capable of forming an helix structure may be used to form the above described helix polypeptide and can be suitably selected depending on a particular purpose. Preferably amino acids which are likely to form an helix structure may be used including for example aspartic acid Asp glutamic acid Glu arginine Arg lysine Lys histidine His asparagine Asn glutamine Gln serine Ser threonine Thr alanine Ala valine Val leucine Leu isoleucine Ile cysteine Cys methionine Met tyrosine Tyr phenylalanine Phe and tryptophan Trp . Amino acids may be used alone or in combination.

The above described helix polypeptide may be either hydrophilic hydrophobic or amphiphilic depending on the amino acids selected. For hydrophilic helix polypeptides serine Ser threonine Thr aspartic acid Asp glutamic acid Glu arginine Arg lysine Lys asparagine Asn and glutamine Gln may be preferably used. For hydrophobic helix polypeptides phenylalanine Phe tryptophan Trp isoleucine Ile tyrosine Tyr methionine Met leucine Leu and valine Val may be used.

In the above described helix polypeptides carboxyl groups in those amino acids forming the helix which do not contribute to peptide bonds can be esterified to obtain hydrophobic polypeptides while the esterified carboxyl groups can be hydrolyzed to obtain hydrophilic polypeptides.

Amino acids may either be L amino acids D amino acids or derivatives thereof with modified side chains.

The number of bonds the degree of polymerization of the amino acid in the helix polypeptide is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. However 10 to 5000 is preferable.

If the number of bonds the degree of polymerization is less than 10 it may not be possible for the polyamino acid to form a stable helix. If the number of bonds the degree of polymerization exceeds 5000 vertical orientation may be difficult to achieve.

Suitable specific examples of the helix polypeptide are polyglutamic acid derivatives such as poly methyl L glutamate poly ethyl L glutamate poly benzyl L glutamate poly n hexyl L glutamate and the like polyaspartic acid derivatives such as poly benzyl L aspartate and the like polypeptides such as poly L leucine poly L alanine poly L methionine poly L phenylalanine poly L lysine poly methyl L glutamate and the like.

The helix polypeptide may be a commercially available helix polypeptide or may be appropriately synthesized or prepared in accordance with methods disclosed in known publications and the like.

As one example of synthesizing the helix polypeptide the synthesis of block copolypeptide poly L lysine poly methyl L glutamate PLLZ PMLGis as follows. As is shown by the following formula block copolypeptide poly L lysine poly methyl L glutamate PLLZ PMLGcan be synthesized by polymerizing N carbobenzoxy L lysine N carboxy acid anhydride LLZ NCA by using n hexylamine as an initiator and then polymerizing methyl L glutamate N carboxy acid anhydride MLG NCA .

Synthesis of the helix polypeptide is not limited to the above described method and the helix polypeptide can be synthesized by a genetic engineering method. Specifically the helix polypeptide can be manufactured by transforming a host cell by a expression vector in which is integrated a DNA which encodes the object polypeptide and culturing the transformant and the like.

Examples of the expression vector include a plasmid vector a phage vector a plasmid and phage chimeric vector and the like.

Examples of the host cell include prokaryotic microorganisms such as and the like eukaryotic microorganisms such as yeast or the like zooblasts and the like.

The helix polynucleotide may be prepared by removing the helix structural portion from a natural fibrous protein such as keratin myosin epidermin fibrinogen tropomyosin silk fibroin or the like.

The DNA may be a single stranded DNA. However the DNA is preferably a double stranded DNA from the standpoints that the rod shape can be stably maintained other substances can be intercalated into the interior and the like.

A double stranded DNA has a double helix structure in which two polynucleotide chains which are in the form of right wound spirals are formed so as to be positioned around a single central axis in a state in which they extend in respectively opposite directions.

The polynucleotide chains are formed by four types of nucleic acid bases which are adenine A thiamine T guanine G and cytosine C . The nucleic acid bases in the polynucleotide chain exist in the form of projecting inwardly within a plane which is orthogonal to the central axis and form so called Watson Crick base pairs. Thiamine specifically hydrogen bonds with adenine and cytosine specifically hydrogen bonds with guanine. As a result in a double stranded DNA the two polypeptide chains are bonded complementarily.

The DNA can be prepared by known methods such as PCR Polymerase Chain Reaction LCR Ligase Chain Reaction 3SR Self Sustained Sequence Replication SDA Strand Displacement Amplification and the like. Among these the PCR method is preferable.

Further the DNA can be prepared by being directly removed enzymatically from a natural gene by a restriction enzyme. Or the DNA can be prepared by a genetic cloning method or by a chemical synthesis method.

In the case of a genetic cloning method a large amount of the DNA can be prepared by for example integrating a structure in which a normal nucleic acid has been amplified into a vector which is selected from plasmid vectors phage vectors plasmid and phage chimeric vectors and the like and then introducing the vector into an arbitrary host in which propagation is possible and which is selected from prokaryotic microorganisms such as or the like eukaryotic microorganisms such as yeast or the like zooblasts and the like.

Examples of chemical synthesis methods include liquid phase methods or solid phase synthesis methods using an insoluble carrier such as a tolyester method a phosphorous acid method or the like. In the case of a chemical synthesis method the double stranded DNA can be prepared by using a known automatic synthesizing device or the like to prepare a large amount of single stranded DNA and thereafter carrying out annealing.

Amylose is a polysaccharide having a spiral structure in which D glucose which forms starch which is a homopolysaccharide of higher plants for storage is joined in a straight chain by 1 4 bonds.

The molecular weight of the amylose is preferably around several thousand to 150 000 in number average molecular weight.

The amylose may be a commercially available amylose or may be appropriately prepared in accordance with known methods.

The length of the rod shaped body is not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. However from the standpoint of causing light reflection of an incident light as colored interference light which will be described later a length of 810 nm or less is preferable and 10 nm to 810 nm is more preferable. The length of diameter of the rod shaped body is not particularly limited and in the case of helix polypeptides it is approximately 0.8 to 2.0 nm.

The entire rod shaped body may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic. Or the rod shaped body may be amphiphilic such that a portion thereof is hydrophobic or hydrophilic and the other portion thereof exhibits the opposite property of the one portion. When the rod shaped body is amphiphilic it is advantageous in that orientation or dispersion at the boundary face in oil phase aqueous phase mixtures and gaseous phase liquid phase mixtures becomes easy.

In the case of an amphiphilic rod shaped body the numbers of the lipophilic hydrophobic portions and hydrophilic portions are not particularly limited and may be appropriately selected in accordance with the object. Further in this case the portions which are lipophilic hydrophobic and the portions which are hydrophilic may be positioned alternately or either type of portion may be positioned only at one end portion of the rod shaped body.

In the case of the amphiphilic rod shaped body there is no particular limitation for the numbers of the moiety showing hydrophobicity and the moiety showing hydrophilicity but that may be appropriately selected according to the object. In that case the moiety showing hydrophobicity and the moiety showing hydrophilicity may be alternately positioned. Any of the moieties may be positioned only at one end of the rod shaped body.

One example of the above described amphiphilic rod shaped structure is shown in . In this Figure a rod structured element comprises a hydrophobic part at one end and a hydrophilic part at the other end thereof.

Vol. 116 p. 2655 1994 and Japanese Patent Application Laid Open Nos. 5 5837 8 27284 8 334621 and 9 104656.

Irradiation of the azobenzene compound with UV light may cause the transformation of the azobenzene compound from trans to cis isomer in which the distance between the distal ends of its benzene rings is about 5.5 see b below resulting in preferable color change.

A configuration variable element or components may be bonded to one end of the linear chain as shown in to the side chain or chains as shown in or both to one end of the linear chain and to the side chain s as shown in of the above described rod shaped body. Preferably a configuration variable element may be bonded at least to one end of the linear chain of a rod shaped body for better color change.

An exemplary amphiphilic rod shaped body which has a capturing structured body and a configuration variable element bonded thereto is shown in . In this Figure a rod shaped body comprises a hydrophobic part at one end and a hydrophilic part at the other end thereof and has a capturing structured body attached to one end and a configuration variable element azobenzene compound attached to the other end of the rod shaped body . A plurality of capturing structured bodies may be bonded to the side surface of the rod shaped body .

Preferably the above described capturing unit can exhibit color forming so that it can easily be detected and identified.

Color forming may include color formation using colorant e.g. dyes and or pigments which is based on a chemical structure in which electron transition may occur when exposed to light thereby developing color as well as by reflecting an incident light as colored interference light e.g. those found in tropical fish or phosphorus powder on butterfly wing which is based on a physical structure in which a color tone may change corresponding to the thickness of the membrane layer and its refractive index.

Reflection of the incident light as colored interference light is based on the multi layered thin film interference principle the basic principle of color forming exhibited by the scaly powder of the wings of a Morpho butterfly and when an external stimulation such as an electric field a magnetic field heat or light e.g. natural light infrared ray or UV light is applied to a material which exhibits light reflection of the incident light as colored interference light e.g. membrane or layer a portion of the incident light which has a wavelength of a particular range will be reflected corresponding to the thickness of the material which exhibits light reflection of the incident light as colored interference light membrane or layer to be used as well as to its refractive index whereby the surface of the material which exhibits light reflection of the incident light as colored interference light may exhibit color. Its color tone may be suitably regulated as found on the skin of the chameleon depending on the external stimulation to be applied.

Among all a light reflection of the incident light as colored interference light may be preferable for the present invention since it may not require use of dyes or pigments and can thus reduce the volume of liquid waste resulting from manufacturing processes and can economize on energy water and electricity required for dying processes as well as it is human nature friendly without causing dye or pigment induced skin trouble and so on.

The principle of light reflection of the incident light as colored interference light will be described below.

As shown in when a membrane consisting of rod shaped bodies is exposed to light the wavelength of the interference light caused by the membrane may be emphasized by condition 1 below while enfeebled by condition 2 below 

In equations 1 and 2 above means the wavelength of interference light nm means the incident angle of the light directed to the membrane t means the thickness nm of the membrane 1 means the number of layers in the membrane n means the refractive index of the membrane and m means an integer of 1 or more.

The color wavelength may be changed by selecting the thickness of the membrane. This technique can be applied to color imaging technology.

The reflection of incident light as colored interference light may be performed by a single repeat subunit comprising a rod shaped body and a configuration variable element or by a linear chain consisting of two or more of such repeat subunits which are linked to another.

Any granular substrate that has a surface onto which a capturing unit can be fixed may be used. The size of the granules can be suitably selected depending on a particular purpose. Preferably it may have a smaller range of particle size distribution so that it can efficiently capture its target and be post treated easily.

The above described granular substrate may be made of polymer such as polyacrylamide gelatin agar and inorganic metals e.g. silicon . The surface of a granular substrate may be processed when desired so that a capturing unit can easily be fixed to the substrate.

One preferable embodiment of the above described particle size or particle diameter variable reactor comprises a granular substrate and a capturing unit fixed onto the granular substrate in which the capturing unit has a plurality of repeat subunits each comprising a rod shaped body a configuration variable element attached to one end and a capturing structured body fixed to the other end of the rod shaped body.

One preferable example of this embodiment of the above described particle size variable reactor may be a particle size or particle diameter variable reactor which comprises a granular substrate and capturing unit fixed onto the surface of the granular substrate as shown in . In the particle size variable reactor each subunit of capturing unit may comprise a rod shaped body a configuration variable element and a capturing structured body .

When a particle size variable reactor has a configuration variable element that can be structurally transformed by irradiation with light e.g. UV or visible light the particle size of the reactor may be changed by irradiation with light e.g. UV or visible light as shown in .

On the other hand when the reactor shown in is irradiated with visible light configuration variable elements azobenzene compound may be transformed into trans isomer as described above. As a result the tilted rod shaped body may be again stood up and the reactor may thus have an increased particle size see . In this way the particle size of the reactor may be increased by irradiation with visible light.

As described above the particle size of the reactor can be reversibly increased and decreased by selecting irradiation light UV or visible light . By this configuration the flow rate of the reactor or the speed of target capturing capturing reaction rate can be desirably controlled. Therefore a target can be suitably captured regardless of the type of the object to be captured the dispersion degree of the object capturing efficiency and the environment of the dispersion solution into which the object has been dispersed.

Further a filter membrane may be preferably provided which allows the passage of a particle size variable reactor with cis isomer of the configuration variable element azobenzene compound but not with trans isomer. According to this embodiment for example an aqueous phase into which an object to be captured has been dispersed may be separated from an oil phase by providing such a filter membrane therebetween whereby the object dispersed into the aqueous phase can be selectively transported into the oil phase.

In for example when an aqueous phase into which a lipophilic target and particle size variable reactor have been dispersed is separated from an oil phase by providing a filter membrane therebetween in the presence of visible light irradiation the particle size variable reactor may firstly capture the object in the aqueous solution. Since the configuration variable element azobenzene compound is present as trans isomer the particle size variable reactor has such a larger particle size that it cannot pass through the filter membrane . Next UV irradiation may convert the configuration variable element azobenzene compound into cis isomer. As a result the particle size of the particle size variable reactor may be reduced so that it can pass through the filter membrane into the oil phase. Since the object captured by the particle size variable reactor which has migrated into the oil phase is lipophilic it may be released into the oil phase. In this way the object may be selectively transported from the aqueous phase to the oil phase.

In the particle size variable reactor according to the present invention the distance between the surface of the granular substrate and the capturing structured body located on the distal end of the rod shaped body may preferably be 810 nm or less and more preferably 350 nm 810 nm.

The particle size variable reactor according to the present invention can be preferably used in various fields including medical and industrial fields.

Examples of the present invention will be provided below though the present invention is not limited thereto.

Polymerization of N carboxyl glutamate anhydride methylester MG NCA is performed using cyclodextrin having an amino group as an initiator to obtain poly methyl L glutamate PMG CyD polymerization degree 5200 which has cyclodextrin capturing structured body at one end of the molecule. Then azobenzene compound is bonded to the other end e.g. the end to which cyclodextrin is not attached of the molecule of the resulting PMG CyD by any known method to obtain PMG CyD azobenzene compound.

The poly methyl L glutamate has a length of 0.78 m. Next PMG CyD azobenzene compound is allowed to react directly with halogenated alkyl thiol to incorporate a thiol group into PMG CyD azobenzene compound at its azobenzene compound side. The resulting product is fixed onto a granular substrate gold particle having an average particle size or diameter per volume Dof 40 m at room temperature 24 C. to prepare a particle size variable reactor which exhibited light reflection of incident light as colored interference light.

Next a solution of 2 p toluidinylnaphthalene 6 sulfonate TNS SIGMA Corp. which is the object to be captured by PMG CyD and the particle size variable reactor obtained above in water is combined with n hexane to form aqueous oil phases which are partitioned by providing a filter membrane between the two phases under the conditions of visible light irradiation. After two hours these phases are irradiated with UV light. Particle size variable reactor is detected in the oil phase. 2 p toluidinylnaphthalene 6 sulfonate TNS is detected in the resulting particle size variable reactor.

The color that is structurally developed i.e. reflected by the particle size variable reactor when irradiated with UV light is different from that developed i.e. reflected by the reactor when irradiated with visible light.

In the present example the average particle diameter per volume D of the particle size variable reactor is 40.01 m when irradiated with UV light while it is 41.6 m when irradiated with visible light. A filter membrane of 40.08 m mesh diameter is used.

The process described in Preparation of particle size variable reactor in Example 1 was repeated except for using azomethane instead of azobenzene compound to prepare a particle size variable reactor of which poly methyl L glutamate had a length of 0.78 m and analysis and detection were performed as described in Capturing the object irradiation with visible or UV light and others in Example 1 above. The same results as those obtained in Example 1 were obtained.

In the present example the average particle diameter per volume D of the particle size variable reactor was 40.01 m when irradiated with UV light while it was 41.6 m when irradiated with visible light. A filter membrane of 40.08 m mesh was used.

The process described in Preparation of particle size variable reactor in Example 1 above was repeated except for using azoxybenzene instead of azobenzene compound to prepare a particle size variable reactor of which poly methyl L glutamate had a length of 0.78 m and analysis and detection were performed as described in Capturing the object irradiation with visible or UV light and others in Example 1 above. The same results as those obtained in Example 1 were obtained.

In the present example the average particle diameter per volume D of the particle size variable reactor was 40.01 m when irradiated with UV light while it was 41.6 m when irradiated with visible light. A filter membrane of 40.08 m mesh was used.
