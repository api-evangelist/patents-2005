title: Body thermoregulation using skin temperature feedback
abstract: A method and apparatus for cooling a human being utilizes skin temperature feedback to control the amount of cooling. When the measured skin temperature reaches a preset high temperature, the human being is cooled until the measured skin temperature reaches a preset low temperature, and then cooling of the human being stops. In one embodiment, the preset high temperature is about 35 degrees Centigrade and the preset low temperature is about 33 degrees Centigrade. Cooling of the human being resumes whenever the preset high temperature is reached and pauses whenever the preset low temperature is reached to thereby provide intermittent cooling to the human being. The invention is also applicable to heating a human being.

Many occupations e.g. firefighters soldiers astronauts explosive ordnance toxic waste clean up require workers to wear personal protective equipment PPE with characteristic high insulation clo and low moisture permeability i properties. These conditions impose uncompensable heat stress required evaporative cooling exceeds evaporative cooling capacity of environment that results in rapid heat storage and a reduction in work capabilities. Specifically physical and cognitive performance is severely compromised and heat strain becomes overwhelming in a relatively short period.

Present day microclimate cooling MCC systems are designed to remove heat from the skin using ice packet vests cooled air or by circulating cooled liquid in tubes. Each of these methods is effective in reducing heat strain and extending work performance. For most military space and firefighting applications liquid cooled systems have several advantages over other MCC approaches including reduced logistical requirements and sustainable high cooling capacities.

Engineering approaches for developing liquid MCC systems have focused on enhancing MCC efficacy by reducing coolant temperatures or increasing coolant flow. However these engineering approaches increase MCC power battery requirements. Ironically they may also reduce heat transfer potential in certain situations. Skin cooling produces cutaneous vascular constriction that decreases convective heat transfer from the body core to the periphery. Superficial shell insulation skin and subcutaneous fat approaches near maximal values at skin temperatures of 30 C. with the onset of vasoconstriction occurring at skin temperatures of 32 33 C. Thus the heat loss advantage obtained by widening the core to skin temperature gradient with constant cooling is progressively reduced by increased superficial shell insulation as skin temperature drops below 32 C.

A primary object of the present invention is to reduce the amount of power required for body cooling and or heating. This and other objects of the invention are achieved by using skin temperature feedback to control the cooling or heating of the body. In one embodiment the skin temperature is maintained between a high temperature of about 35 degrees Centigrade and a low temperature of about 33 degrees Centigrade.

Further objects features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The inventors were the first to compare the effects of systematic intermittent cooling IC to constant cooling CC of the skin for improving MCC effectiveness during work in protective clothing. They discovered that the heat flux benefits from periodically intermittently applying cooling to warm vasodilated skin offset the potential for vasoconstriction that occurs with continuous skin cooling. The inventors observed that when skin temperature was maintained between about 33 and 35 degrees Centigrade in IC thermoregulatory and cardiovascular strain was similar to CC despite less total cooling time with IC. That is to say this is the temperature range that optimized heat flux by minimizing vasoconstriction without undue cardiovascular strain and with an added potential of reducing MCC power battery requirements as a consequence of reducing the total required cooling time. The inventors hypothesized that the most efficient MCC system would provide automated cooling on demand using an approximate skin temperature range 33 to 35 degrees Centigrade as feedback control for perfusion begin cooling when skin temperature reaches 35 degrees Centigrade and withdrawal stop cooling when skin temperature reaches 33 degrees Centigrade .

An embodiment of a skin temperature feedback MCC system was built and the energy savings hypothesis was tested. CC IC and skin temperature feedback were compared. All three paradigms resulted in similar thermoregulatory and cardiovascular strain as well as perceived thermal comfort. Compared with CC IC and skin temperature feedback reduced power requirements by 25 and 46 respectively. This reduction in power requirement is a very significant advance in the art of human body thermoregulation.

One aspect of the invention is a method of cooling the human being that comprises measuring skin temperature of the human being and when the measured skin temperature reaches a preset high temperature cooling the human being until the measured skin temperature reaches a preset low temperature and then ceasing cooling of the human being otherwise known as skin temperature feedback for microclimate cooling. 

In one embodiment of the cooling method the preset high temperature is about 35 degrees Centigrade and the preset low temperature is about 33 degrees Centigrade. Cooling begins when the sensed skin temperature reaches about 35 degrees Centigrade and continues until the sensed skin temperature falls to about 33 degrees Centigrade. The cycle is repeated as necessary.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of heating a human being that comprises measuring skin temperature of the human being and when the measured skin temperature reaches a preset low temperature heating the human being until the measured skin temperature reaches a preset high temperature and then ceasing heating of the human being otherwise known as skin temperature feedback for microclimate heating. 

In one embodiment of the heating method the preset low temperature is about 33 degrees Centigrade and the preset high temperature is about 35 degrees Centigrade. Heating begins when the sensed skin temperature falls to about 33 degrees Centigrade and continues until the sensed skin temperature reaches about 35 degrees Centigrade. The cycle is repeated as necessary.

Another aspect of the invention is a body cooling apparatus shown schematically in . Body cooling apparatus includes a cooling garment that is fitted on a human being a cooling source cooling connections between the cooling source and the cooling garment at least one device for measuring skin temperature and an electrical connection between the skin temperature measuring device and a control for the cooling source .

Cooling garment may be for example a liquid cooling garment an air cooling garment or a phase change cooling garment. Cooling source may be for example a chilled water source a cold air source or a source of a phase change refrigerant. In one embodiment garment is a liquid cooling garment made of for example cotton or Nomex aramid fabric woven or laminated around small diameter Tygon tubing 2.5 mm I.D. divided into multiple parallel circuits. It should be noted that apparatus may be readily adapted for body heating by exchanging a heat source for the cooling source .

Garment may be styled to cover any portion of the body. For example as shown in there may be a hood section to cover the head a vest section to cover the torso and a pants section to cover the legs. In an embodiment of the garment that includes a hood section a vest section and a pants section the percentage of body surface area covered is about sixty percent. For improved comfort heat transfer tubes may be omitted from the crotch and buttocks areas. Preferably the garment does not cover sensitive wear points such as elbows and the back of the knees.

The device for measuring skin temperature may be for example a skin thermistor. A single thermistor or multiple thermistors placed at different locations on the body may be used. In the case of a single thermistor the skin temperature used to control the cooling source or heating source is measured by the single thermistor. If multiple skin thermistors are used the mean weighted skin temperature may be calculated as 0.30 upper body skin temperature 0.20 lower body skin temperature . See e.g Ramanathan N. L. J. Appl. Physiol. 19 931 933 1964. The upper body skin temperature is the sum of two measurements on the upper body for example the chest and arm or the head and arm or twice a single measurement . The lower body skin temperature is the sum of two measurements on the lower body for example the thigh and calf or twice a single measurement .

By way of example shows three thermistors and . Assume thermistor on the head reads 33 degrees thermistor on the chest reads 35 degrees and thermistor on. the thigh reads 36 degrees. Using the above described relation the mean skin temperature equals 0.30 33 35 0.20 36 36 which equals 34.8. Other methods for calculating mean skin temperature may of course be used.

In one embodiment cooling source is a chilled water source that includes a heat exchanger and a vapor compression refrigerator. Heat generated by the human is captured by the chilled water circulating through liquid cooling garment . The chilled water returns to the chilled water source and rejects the body heat through a heat exchanger to the working fluid of a vapor compression refrigerator. The heat exchanger and vapor compression refrigerator may be carried in a backpack or a belt pack. The refrigerator may be for example battery powered or internal combustion engine powered. The control receives the mean skin temperature and controls the flow of chilled water to the liquid cooling garment. When the mean skin temperature reaches about 35 degrees Centigrade the flow of chilled water is turned on. When the mean skin temperature reaches about 33 degrees Centigrade the flow of chilled water is turned off. This cycle is repeated as long as cooling is desired. The control may be for example a pump in the chilled water lines a bypass valve that bypasses the heat exchanger or other devices for controlling cooling systems.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain preferred embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
