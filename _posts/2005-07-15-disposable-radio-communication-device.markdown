title: Disposable radio communication device
abstract: A disposable radio communication device includes a body defining an enclosed chamber, a power source mounted in the chamber, an on-off switch mounted on the body and accessible from outside the body, a processor mounted in the chamber and powered by the power source, and a transceiver mounted in the chamber and in communication with the processor. A speaker is mounted in the chamber in communication with the processor. A microphone is mounted in the body and is in communication with the processor. The transceiver is adapted to receive sound signals from a remote unit and input the signals to the speaker for broadcast, and the microphone is adapted to receive sound signals from outside the body and input the received sound signals to the processor for transmittal by the transceiver to the remote unit.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefore.

The invention relates to radio communications devices and is directed more particularly to a disposable radio communication device which may be dropped into building rubble or other such areas not readily accessible by rescue personnel to make vocal or other sound signal contact with survivors buried in the rubble.

There have been experiments with disposable microphones which may be dropped into the rubble of collapsed buildings and the like to aid search and rescue teams to hear survivors over the surface noise levels caused by heavy lift cranes air hammers bull dozers and large numbers of rescue workers.

It has become apparent that there is a need for disposable devices of similar nature but which are adapted for two way communication between a survivor trapped in the rubble and a surface rescue worker such that a survivor can be alerted to the fact that he should presently make a sound and can react in a manner to make known his presence.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide a disposable two way radio device which may be dropped into a rubble pile and which by its weight and shape will tend to drop down well into the rubble before coming to rest.

A further object of the invention is to provide such a device adapted to broadcast a voice message or other signal from a rescue worker at the surface to a location in which the device has come to rest and to transmit any voice or other message detected by the device back to the rescue worker.

With the above and other objects in view a feature of the invention is the provision of a disposable radio communication device comprising a body defining an enclosed chamber a power source mounted in the chamber an on off switch mounted on the body and accessible from outside the body a processor mounted in the chamber and powered by the power source and a transceiver mounted in the chamber and in communication with the processor. A speaker is mounted in the body and is provided with a face portion substantially co extensive with an outer surface of the body the speaker being in communication with the processor and a microphone is mounted in the body and in communication with the processor. The transceiver is adapted to receive a voice signal or other sound signal from a remote unit and input the signal to the speaker for broadcast and the microphone is adapted to receive a sound signal from outside the body and input the received signal to the processor for transmittal by the transceiver to the remote unit.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular device embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to is will be seen that a disposable radio communication device illustrative of an embodiment of the invention includes a body preferably of a spherical configuration designed to be rugged enough to with stand impacts and other crushing forces and weighted defining an enclosed chamber .

A processor on off switch is mounted on the body and is accessible from outside of the body to turn on a processor which when turned on is powered by the power source .

A transceiver is in communication with the processor and is provided with an antenna for communications between the transceiver and a remote unit not shown .

A broadcast speaker is mounted on the body and is provided with a face portion which is substantially co extensive with the spherical surface of the body . The speaker is in communication with the processor .

At least once microphone and preferably a plurality of microphones of the type shown in is mounted on the body . The microphones are in communication with the processor .

The transceiver is adapted to receive a voice signal from a remote unit not shown and input the signal to the processor and thence to the speaker for broadcast. The microphones are adapted to receive any voice or other sound message from outside the body and input the received message to the processor for transmittal by the transceiver to the remote unit. The broadcast signal may be from a rescue worker at the remote unit or a recording urging survivors to utter or tap out a sound. The sound signal is typically a voice message but may be a metallic ping or hand clap or any other noise which a survivor is capable of producing.

An orientation sensor is disposed in the chamber and is in communication with the processor for providing to the rescue worker an indication as to the direction from which a voice or other sound signal reaches the body .

In operation the switch is moved by an operator to the on position which starts operation of the processor which draws power from the power source .

The body is dropped into a void in a rubble area. Because of the shape and weight of the body it tends to roll and bounce through openings in the rubble until coming to a stop.

Upon receipt of a voice message from a rescue worker at a remote site the speaker begins broadcasting the message into the surrounding rubble.

The processor continues operation of the speaker the transceiver and the microphones as long as there is power provided by the power source .

In practice a number of the devices are tossed into a rubble pile all in communication with the remote unit.

There is thus provided a disposable radio communication device which may be dropped into a rubble pile and which tends to drop deep into the pile and which sends any sounds emanating from the area surrounding the device to a remote station for alerting rescue workers to the presence of a survivor.

The broadcast message would be of the sort urging any survivor hearing the message to make a voice noise or any other kind of noise the survivor is capable of generating.

Any such response to the broadcast message is picked up by one of the microphones and is routed by the processor to the transceiver which sends the response to the remote unit alerting rescue personnel to the presence of one or more survivor in a given area. The orientation sensor provides an indication as to the attitude of the body whether right side up upside down or the like. The processor and transceiver provide an indication as to which microphone has received the most pronounced signal. The rescue workers knowing roughly the location of the body are thereby enabled to start a search in the likeliest location of a survivor.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
