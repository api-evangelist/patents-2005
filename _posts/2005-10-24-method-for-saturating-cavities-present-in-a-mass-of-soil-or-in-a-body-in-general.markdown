abstract: A method for saturating cavities present in a mass of soil or in a body in general, comprising at least one step for at least partial filling of the cavity by introducing into the cavity a filler material in the solid state or in the fluid state and capable of setting. At least one step of saturating the cavity is then performed by introducing into the cavity a fluid synthetic substance which expands and sets by chemical reaction. The synthetic substance is adapted to generate, as a consequence of its expansion, at least the saturation of the cavity and a compaction and/or loading of the filler material introduced into the cavity in the filling step, creating an optional state of permanent tension on the walls that delimit the cavity, to the point of producing, if necessary, a deformation of the walls.

The present invention relates to a method for saturating cavities present in a mass of soil or in a body in general such as a body of a built structure so as to produce optionally a state of permanent tension on the walls of said cavity such as to generate if necessary a deformation of the walls. More particularly the method according to the present invention allows to generate mutual contact among the elements that constitute the material used to fill a cavity and if necessary allows to apply to the walls of said cavity a state of permanent tension which can optionally produce an expansion of the volume of the saturated cavity. More generally the method according to the invention can be used to produce continuity between different volumes of soil interrupted by natural or man made cavities the most frequent examples relate to large karst cavities tunnels or mines no longer in use underground reservoirs ancient crypts et cetera and to fill cavities above the ground structural gaps reservoirs etc .

Underground or above ground cavities can constitute a problem as regards distribution of the stresses within a mass of soil or more generally within a body. Said cavities in fact constitute a discontinuity which as such does not cooperate in the distribution of the stresses within a volume.

Consider for example a cavity in a mass of soil located at the footing of a tall building. According to the laws of geotechnical engineering in such a situation the load of the building is transferred to the soil unevenly concentrating proximate to the surface that surrounds the cavity. In extreme cases this load concentration can even reach and exceed the ultimate strength of the soil with consequent collapse of the entire volume and accordingly of everything that rests thereon.

In general these methods have the goal of filling the entire volume of the cavity by means of setting liquid substances optionally mixed with inert solid filler material.

In particular European Patent Application no. 0114448 discloses a method for partially or totally filling cavities by pumping a cement based foaming material which contains an inorganic expanded material such as pearlite and vermiculite. This method despite being very expensive does not ensure the complete filling of underground cavities with domed surfaces having an irregular geometry since the expansion of the inorganic material is provided before pouring for filling and therefore the final distribution of the solidified mixture within the cavity follows a geometry which is governed only by the force of gravity.

Japanese Patents no. 09 228371 and no. 11 323904 disclose methods for filling cavities which are based on the separate use of granular solid material optionally with the addition of lubricating foaming agents for filling the easily accessible voids and subsequently of cement mortar or other materials in the fluid state which are poured into the cavity in order to saturate the intergranular voids of the previously deposited solid material and fill the portions of the cavity that have not yet been reached. Even with these methods saturation of the dome of the cavity is not possible since the mortar or other material in the fluid state due to the force of gravity tends to settle on the bottom before solidifying. Moreover the execution cost of this method can be very high since complete saturation of the intergranular voids can entail the use of large quantities of mortar or other material in the fluid state. Finally the considerable weight increase that the filling mixture produces on the ground underneath the filled cavity must not be neglected.

Another cavity filling technique is disclosed in Japanese Patent no. 2002 348849 according to which the filling mixture is injected into the cavity until preset injection pressures are recorded and in any case until said mixture exits from holes provided adjacent to the injection duct. This technique in addition to suffering the disadvantages already noted with reference to the methods described above can entail in the case of underground cavities with fractured walls very high execution costs due to the disproportionate use of mixture with respect to the volume of the cavity to be saturated.

Another method which has the disadvantage of being unable to saturate the volume in the dome is the one disclosed in US Patent Application no. 2002 0015619. This method consists in plugging the underground cavities by using only solid inert material assisted by a lubricating foaming agent which facilitates its arrangement in the void.

Other known types of methods for filling underground cavities use expanding synthetic filler materials. For example the methods disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3 478 520 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 744 700 use expanding synthetic material such as polystyrene which increases in volume if it is placed in contact with heat sources. The methods for applying heat to the expanding synthetic material can be of various kinds. This method which is unquestionably very expensive is difficult to apply both as regards providing if needed a sufficient heat source and as regards distributing uniformly the heat within the cavity allowing even expansion of the expanding synthetic material contained therein.

The aim of the present invention is to provide a method for saturating cavities present in a mass of soil or in a body in general in order to restore its continuity which is capable of solving the problems described above with reference to known types of methods.

Within this aim an object of the invention is to provide a method which allows to generate mutual contact among the elements that constitute the material used to fill a cavity compacting it and allows to apply to the walls of said cavity an optional state of permanent tension which can generate if required an expansion of said walls.

Another object of the invention is to provide a method which can be performed in a short time and with compact equipment.

Another object of the invention is to provide a method which can be performed in absolute safety even in the immediate vicinity of dwellings and with limited space available.

This aim and these and other objects which will become better apparent hereinafter are achieved by a method for saturating cavities present in a mass of soil or in a body in general characterized in that it comprises 

With reference to the figures the method according to the invention substantially comprises at least one step of filling at least partially the cavity by introducing in the cavity a filler material which is constituted by an inert material in the solid state preferably in granules or by a material in the fluid state which can solidify and at least one step of saturating the cavity by introducing in said cavity a fluid synthetic substance which expands and hardens by chemical reaction and is adapted to produce as a consequence of its expansion at least the saturation of the cavity and a compaction and or loading of the filler material introduced in the cavity during the filling step.

The term saturation with reference to the function performed by the synthetic substance is used to intend that the synthetic substance fills the spaces of the cavity that have not been reached by the filler material during the filling step and any macroscopic spaces that are present in the filler material without thereby necessarily affecting also all the minimal spaces such as the intergranular spaces of the material if said material is constituted by inert material in granules.

The quantity of synthetic substance introduced in the cavity during the saturation step and its degree of expansion by chemical reaction are preferably adapted to produce as an effect of the expansion of the synthetic substance a state of permanent tension on the walls which delimit the cavity to the point of optionally producing if required an outward deformation of said walls of the cavity .

More particularly before the filling step the method according to the invention comprises a first preparation step in which first holes for connecting the cavity to the outside are formed in the region of the mass of soil or of the body in general which is comprised between the cavity and a working surface located outside the mass of soil or the body in general.

In the preferred embodiment illustrated in the figures which relates to a particularly advantageous application of the method according to the invention in the filling of an underground cavity the working surface is located above the cavity and the first holes lie substantially vertically or are inclined with respect to a vertical direction.

In any case it may occur that the most convenient working surface does not lie above the cavity but is located laterally or even below it.

The first holes are provided in such a manner that the distance between two contiguous holes ranges preferably from 1 m to 20 m.

The length of the first holes may vary according to the conditions of the soil and according to the operating requirements and must be at least such as to allow to reach from the working surface the surface that delimits the underground cavity .

The filling step is then performed during this step the filler material is introduced in the cavity preferably by means of a pump P through the first holes .

Preferably during this filling step the filler material is introduced in the cavity through first pipes inserted beforehand in the first holes .

The first pipes can be made of steel PVC or other suitable material and are connected at their end which protrudes from the ground to the flexible hose that arrives from the pump.

The filler material can be constituted by a material in the fluid state which solidifies over time or by an inert material in the solid state preferably in granules which is conveyed through the first pipes with the aid of a conveyance fluid such as air water foaming agent or others.

If the filler material is constituted by a material in the fluid state said material can have a density ranging substantially from 20 kg mto 2400 kg m.

The simple compressive strength of the fluid filler material once solidified ranges from 1.50 kg cmto 500 kg cm.

The modulus of deformation of the fluid filler material once solidified ranges from 30 kg cmto 400 000 kg cm.

Merely by way of indication concrete or any other chemical compound can be used as a fluid filler material .

Examples of a suitable chemical compound are the aminaplast duroplasts such as urea melamin aldehyde foam.

If the filler material is constituted by an inert material in the solid state in granules it preferably has a density substantially ranging from 200 kg mto 2000 kg m.

The simple compressive strength of the individual granules or elements which constitute the solid filler material preferably ranges from 5 kg cmto 2000 kg cm.

Merely by way of example sand and or gravel expanded clay or waste of industrial processes can be used as inert materials in granules.

After the filling step and before the saturation step the method according to the invention can comprise a second preparation step during which starting from the working surface second holes are provided which lead into the cavity above the filler material and or into the filler material .

The second holes lie substantially vertically or along a direction which is inclined with respect to a vertical direction in the volume of soil comprised between the working surface and the surface that delimits the underground cavity to be saturated and can also affect the filler material previously introduced in the cavity .

Preferably the distance between two contiguous holes of the second holes ranges substantially from 1 m to 20 m.

During the saturation step the synthetic substance is introduced in the cavity through the second holes but it might be possible to use partially or fully also the first holes for this purpose. Preferably the synthetic substance during the saturation step is injected into the cavity by pumping through second pipes which are inserted before the pumping of the synthetic substance into the second holes and or into the first holes .

If the second pipes have a diameter which is much smaller than the holes or in which they are inserted they are arranged within the holes or by using a plugging bag which is adapted to prevent the reverse flow toward the surface of the synthetic substance and to anchor the pipe in the hole or .

The second pipes can be made of copper steel PVC or other suitable material that is compatible with the materials used and the pumping conditions.

The synthetic substance used in the step of saturation following expansion by chemical reaction preferably has a potential volume increase ranging substantially from 2 to 30 times preferably from 10 to 30 times its initial volume i.e. its volume before expansion. The expression potential expansion is understood to refer to the expansion that the synthetic substance would undergo if its expansion occurred freely in the atmosphere. The actual expansion of the synthetic substance is inversely proportional to the resistance that the filler material and the walls of the cavity oppose to said expansion when the synthetic substance is pumped into the cavity .

The maximum expansion pressure generated by the synthetic substance during expansion is greater than the pressure produced by the weight of the filler material that is present above the outlet of the second pipes in the cavity so as to achieve by way of the expansion of the synthetic substance good compaction and or loading of the filler material against all the walls of the cavity completely filling any voids in the dome and generating a state of tension on the walls with possible outward deformation of said walls . The maximum expansion pressure of the synthetic substance depends on the composition of the synthetic substance and increases with the resistance opposed by the filler material and by the walls of the cavity to this expansion.

The maximum expansion pressure of the synthetic substance in fully confined conditions ranges conveniently from 200 kPa to 20 000 kPa preferably higher than 500 kPa.

The expansion of the synthetic substance produces a compaction and or loading of the filler material further achieving if said filler material is constituted by material in granules mutual contact among the granules that compose it.

The synthetic substance is a substance composed of at least two components which are mixed in an appropriate apparatus and are pumped into the second pipes preferably with a pressure ranging from 5 to 30 bars.

The synthetic substance preferably has a reaction time understood as the time interval between when the components are mixed and when the expansion begins which ranges substantially from 2 to 80 seconds preferably from 2 to 15 seconds.

The reaction time of the synthetic substance is such as to allow said substance to flow correctly through the second pipes without plugging them and at the same time limit considerably the dispersion of said substance before expansion within the small voids that exist between the granules or elements which constitute the filler material . This allows by virtue of the expansion of the synthetic substance to compact the filler material and to push it even into the dome or into the interstices of the cavity and or fill them directly thus filling completely and totally the cavity at the same time allowing a considerable saving of expanding substance which is very expensive and of production times. It must in fact be considered that the total volume of all the small voids that exist among the granules or elements which constitute the filler material if said material is constituted by solid material in granules after the complete filling of a cavity creating an optional state of permanent tension on the walls which delimit the cavity to the point of producing if necessary a deformation of said walls can be even equal to 20 30 of the total volume of said cavity .

Again for this purpose the viscosity of the synthetic substance before the chemical reaction for expansion ranges preferably from 100 mPa s to 700 mPa s at the temperature of 25 C.

Moreover the viscosity of the synthetic substance passes from this value to a value which tends to infinity over a time interval ranging from 5 seconds to 80 seconds starting from the beginning of the chemical reaction for expansion.

Merely by way of example the MDI isocyanate can be constituted by the product URESTYL 10 manufactured by the Dutch company Resina Chemie while the mixture of polyols comprises a polyether polyol and or a polyester polyol a catalyst and water like the product RESINOL AL 1409 manufactured by the same company.

The mixing of these two components produces an expanding polyurethane foam whose density at the end of expansion in the atmosphere i.e. without any confinement is approximately 30 kg mand varies depending on the resistance opposed to the expansion to which it is subjected up to a maximum of 1200 kg min fully confined conditions. Generally the density of the synthetic substance following its injection into the cavity and into the filler material after expansion varies from 50 kg mto 200 kg m.

The synthetic substance once injected and set preferably has a tensile strength substantially ranging from 0.3 MPa to 1.9 MPa and a compressive strength ranging substantially from 0.2 MPa to 2.4 MPa respectively at the densities of 50 kg mand 200 kg m.

Moreover the modulus of elasticity of the synthetic substance after its expansion and setting can be of the same order of magnitude as the modulus of elasticity of the soil that surrounds the cavity and of the filler material so as to ensure complete cooperation both between the two materials contained in the cavity and between the filling of the cavity and the surrounding soil in any state of deformation occurring on site i.e. with a value ranging substantially from 10 MPa to 50 MPa respectively at the densities of 50 kg mand 200 kg m.

The result of the method according to the invention can be assessed by installing at the intrados of the cavity at the selected points pressure measurement units which detect the increase in the state of tension between the filler material and the walls of the cavity during the execution of the saturation step.

In particular the pressure measurement units can be lowered into the cavity before performing the saturation step through the first holes used to introduce the filler material during the filling step.

The volume of the cavity to be saturated can be viewed beforehand by means of a television camera optionally of the infrared type and measured with a laser measuring instrument such as a laser rangefinder. Both instruments optionally arranged on a rigid rod are lowered temporarily into the cavity through the first holes and rotated inside the cavity so as to travel along the main directions .

In practice it has been found that the method according to the invention fully achieves the intended aim since it is capable of ensuring the complete filling of cavities and the optional tensioning of the walls that delimit said cavities eliminating the previous effect of structural discontinuity caused by the presence of the cavities.

Moreover the method according to the invention can be performed with distinctly lower costs and shorter times than required by known types of methods and can be performed with compact equipment and even in the immediate vicinity of dwellings and if limited space is available.

One particular advantage of the method according to the invention is that it requires the use of very small amounts of expanding synthetic substance since the synthetic substance by virtue of its viscosity before expansion of its expansion time and of its great increase in viscosity from when it begins to expand disperses very little among the interstices of the filler material that is used in the filling step and in any cracks in the walls that delimit the cavity to be saturated despite being able to achieve excellent compaction and or loading of the filler material and the optional tensioning of the walls that delimit the cavity.

Although the method according to the invention has been conceived particularly for saturating underground cavities it can in any case be used also to saturate cavities above ground such as for example structural gaps reservoirs et cetera or for bodies in general such as built bodies including underground garages storage basements etc.

The method thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations all of which are within the scope of the appended claims all the details may further be replaced with other technically equivalent elements.
