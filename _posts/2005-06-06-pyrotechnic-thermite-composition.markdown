This invention relates in general to thermite formulations more particularly to thermite formulations for use in cutting torch applications and most particularly to thermite formulations used in cutting torch applications with improved material perforation capability.

Thermite is a formulation consisting of metals and metal oxides that cause an exothermic reaction. Original thermite formulations contained a stoichiometric mix of black iron oxide and aluminum. This formulation produces reaction products of aluminum oxide and molten iron. The molten iron has been used for welding melting destroying metallic objects and as a thermal source for heat conductive material.

Many variants of the original thermite formulations have been developed for specific uses. Several thermite formulations have been created for use in thermite torches. Thermite torches direct the reaction products from a thermite reaction to a specific point to deliver large amounts of energy to a precise region of an object.

Thermite torch formulations have been developed and modified to enhance certain characteristics related to thermite reactions to improve their use. Such characteristics include gas production temperature stability heat transfer shelf life and material perforation. Of these characteristics for thermite torch applications material perforation capability is paramount. For example U.S. Pat. No. 4 963 203 discloses a thermite formulation that is stable at high and low temperatures U.S. Pat. No. 6 627 013 discloses a thermite formulation that increases heat transfer by employing a heat transfer agent of CuO U.S. Pat. No. 4 432 816 discloses a thermite formulation that has increased shelf life by adding a fluorocarbon binder and U.S. Pat. No. 3 695 951 discloses a thermite formulation that provides good material perforation capability using nickel aluminum ferric oxide and powdered tetrafluoroethylene.

While these thermite formulations provide reasonable reaction products for thermite torch applications the only above referenced formulation that provides sufficient material perforation capability for certain applications is the latter. However the reaction products of that thermite formulation use starting materials and produce reaction products that are toxic.

Therefore it is desired to provide a thermite formulation that provides excellent material perforation capability and uses starting materials and produces reaction products that have low toxicity.

The invention proposed herein comprises an improved thermite formulation for use in thermite torch applications. The formulation has excellent material perforation capability and uses low toxicity starting materials and produces low toxicity reaction products.

Accordingly it is an object of this invention to provide a thermite formulation having excellent material perforation capability that may be used in thermite torch applications.

It is a further object of this invention to provide a thermite formulation that employs low toxicity starting materials and low toxicity reaction products.

It is yet a further object of this invention to provide a thermite formulation that employs starting materials having a low cost.

This invention meets these and other objectives related to improved thermite formulations by providing a thermite formulation for use in thermite torch applications comprising from about 3 percent by weight to about 35 percent by weight Mg Al alloy from about 30 percent by weight to about 70 percent by weight CuO and from about 15 percent by weight to about 35 percent by weight MoO. Additionally the formulation may also employ a binder material.

The invention as embodied herein comprises an improved thermite formulation for use in cutting torch applications. The thermite formulation has improved material perforation characteristics over previous thermite formulations and the starting materials and reaction products of the formulation have low toxicity.

In general the thermite formulation of the present invention comprises a fuel of magnesium aluminum alloy magnalium and a combination of oxidizers comprising CuO and MoO. Preferably a small amount of binder material is added to the formulation.

In one embodiment the formulation includes from about 3 percent by weight to about 35 percent by weight magnalium from about 30 percent by weight to about 70 percent by weight CuO and from about 15 percent by weight to about 35 percent by weight MoO. About three percent of a binder material is preferably added to the formulation. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention the thermite formulation contains about 39.8 percent by weight CuO about 33 percent by weight MoO about 24.2 percent by weight magnalium and about 3 percent by weight of a binder material.

Numerous tests of thermite formulations using a number of different fuels oxidizers and binders were conducted to develop the improved thermite formulation described herein. The testing devices and set up are described below.

Experimental torches were constructed of NEMA Grade C phenolic. This material exhibits excellent heat resistance strength and is easily machined. The torches consisted of a lower nozzle body and an upper composition holding body. The nozzle body included a 82 degree converging nozzle and a 0.070 throat. The composition holding body consisted of a 0.5 diameter cavity 1.5 long. Pyrotechnic formulations were pressed inside this cavity.

The torch body was contained in a mild steel housing held together with four grade 8 diameter flange head bolts. A worst case pressure scenario was assumed and the test fixture was designed accordingly. Each bolt was rated for 150 000 psi. Wing nuts were originally used for rapid assembly and disassembly but hex head nuts were substituted after a test fixture exploded.

Replaceable target blocks were integrated into the steel housing. Target material consisted of 1.5 diameter by 1.5 long cylinders of 6061 T6 aluminum and 1020 steel. Aluminum targets were used for most experiments to help differentiate small differences in performance.

Tooling for pressing pyrotechnic compositions into torch bodies was constructed of half hard brass. This tooling was replaced by stronger 303 stainless steel tooling.

The formulation ratio percentages of ingredients were determined by calculating the oxygen balance of each chemical reaction. 10 grams of candidate formulations were weighed out and placed into an antistatic container and thoroughly mixed for 30 seconds from behind a 1 thick Lexan shield. After the formulation was thoroughly mixed it was placed into the top half of the torch body. The composition was then hydraulically compacted with 1 000 pounds of ram force. After pressing the torch body was weighed and the mass of pyrotechnic composition was recorded.

A two inch length of thermalite was inserted into the throat of the nozzle body and the converging section of the nozzle was filled with a slurry of acetone fluorel magnesium and titanium. A Bickford style safety fuse was used to ignite the thermalite and provide a safe delay. Upon drying the bottom and top halves of the torch were fitted together and loaded into a steel housing.

Over 250 different formulations were tested including formulations from a literature review. Material perforation performance was determined based on the mass of target material removed. In some cases very deep penetrations were made into the target but the channels formed were very narrow resulting in little target mass being removed. The formulation described herein performed significantly better than any other formulation tested. A formulation containing 39.8 percent by weight CuO 33 percent by weight MoO3 24.2 percent by weight magnalium and 3 percent by weight polytetrafluoroethylene binder had a ratio of 1.61 of mass of metal removed by the mass of the formulation used. All of these ingredients are inexpensive have a low toxicity and are readily available. The next best performing formulation which is similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 963 203 had a ratio of only 0.86 and a formulation similar to that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 627 013 had a ratio of only 0.60.

Apparent from these results is that the mechanism for torch penetration is a combination of thermal mechanical and chemical actions. Compositions that produced the highest heats of reaction did not necessarily produce the best penetration. In addition mixtures that generated high density reaction products or highest melting point products similarly did not produce the best penetration. No single chemical or physical property can adequately explain or predict the performance of a pyrotechnic torch composition. Furthermore intergranular corrosion of target materials by torch reaction products may influence relative performance. Product density hardness melting point and ductility coupled with reaction enthalpy all couple to determine performance.

The physical state of the reaction products was important to the performance of the torch system and is determined by the heat output of the mixture and the melting and boiling points of the products. It is desirable to produce gas as well as liquid products with the thermite charge in a torch system.

While CuO has been employed in prior thermite formulations MoO while mentioned as an oxidizer candidate has never been employed in practice to applicants knowledge. The results of the tests discussed herein however have found that MoOperformed better in thermite torch formulations than other oxidizers due to a unique combination of physical properties that include the proper boiling points density of reaction products and heat of reaction that assist in giving a thermite formulation employing MoOsuperior cutting capability. Since the results showed that the best cut was obtained using CuO and MoO a combination of these oxidizers was selected for use in the present invention.

There were only three fuels that performed effectively with these metal oxides magnesium aluminum and magnalium. All other metals exhibited poor results. However one surprising result was that magnalium performed better than aluminum magnesium or a mechanical mixture of the component metals. This is most likely due to the fact that magnalium has a lower heat of reaction than the unalloyed mixture of these compounds. Therefore magnalium was selected as the preferred fuel of the present formulation.

A series of formulations containing the same components in the same ratios but with different particle sizes was also tested. Nanometer sized particle formulations were prepared by ultrasonically blending nanometer sized oxidizer particles with nanometer sized fuel particles under a hydrocarbon solvent hexane . The nano mixtures were much lower in density than mixtures of micron sized fuel and oxidizer particles. The nano mixtures exhibited higher sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and burned much faster than coarser mixtures. However nano mixtures yielded low target penetration because the low density of the composition cavity and the high burn rates typically cracked the torch. An additional disadvantage of nanometer sized fuels is their lower active metal content due to their larger relative mass of metal oxide.

Formulations employing flake fuel particles also performed poorly compared to the same formulations employing atomized fuel particles. Atomized fuel particles have a higher bulk density than flake fuel particles and atomized fuel particles are not coated with stearic acid as is flake material. The stearic acid coating decreases the burn rate of metal fuel particles and dilutes the very energetic metallic fuel with a less energetic organic fuel. The combination of lower density and lower caloric output explains the poor performance of flake fuel particle mixtures.

Therefore it is preferred that atomized particles be used for the thermite formulation of the present invention in a size ranging from diameters of about 1 micron to about 70 microns with almost preferable size being a diameter of about 30 microns.

While many known binder materials may be employed in the present inventions by those skilled in the art the preferred binder material will be those that can also act as an oxidizer such as polytetrafluoroethylene.

What is described are specific examples of many possible variations on the same invention and are not intended in a limiting sense. The claimed invention can be practiced using other variations not specifically described above.
