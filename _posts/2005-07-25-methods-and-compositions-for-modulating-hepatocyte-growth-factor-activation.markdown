This application is a non provisional application filed under 37 CFR 1.53 b 1 claiming priority under 35 USC 119 e to provisional application No. 60 591 339 filed Jul. 26 2004 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention relates generally to the fields of molecular biology and growth factor regulation. More specifically the invention concerns modulators of the HGF c met signaling pathway and uses of said modulators.

Hepsin also known as TMRPRSS1 is a cell surface expressed chymotrypsin like serine protease and a member of the family of type II transmembrane serine proteases TTSP which also include matriptase also known as MT SP1 and enteropeptidase 1 . The human hepsin gene located on chromosome 19 at q11 13.2 2 encodes a 417 amino acid polypeptide 3 comprised of a short N terminal cytoplasmic tail a transmembrane region and an extracellular domain Arg45 Leu417 composed of the scavenger receptor cysteine rich SRCR and protease domains. Hepsin zymogen is activated autocatalytically by cleavage at Arg162 Ile163 4 forming a heterodimeric enzyme with the protease domain disulfide linked Cys153 Cys277 to the SRCR domain. In addition to the covalent Cys Cys bond the recently determined crystal structure of hepsin revealed that SRCR and protease domains share an extensive interface region each domain burying about 1200 5 . Because this interface region is located near membrane proximal residues of the SRCR domain the hepsin protease domain and active site may be positioned close to the cell surface 5 . This is fundamentally different from other cell surface assembled serine proteases such as coagulation factors VIIa FVIIa IXa and Xa whose active sites are located far above 60 80 the membrane surface 6 8 .

The physiological function of hepsin has been elusive. Except for coagulation factor VII no macromolecular substrates are known and physiologically relevant inhibitors have not been identified. A role of hepsin in blood coagulation was suggested by Kazama et al. 1995 9 demonstrating that hepsin transfected cells can activate coagulation factor VII. However hepsin deficient mice were viable and showed no blood coagulation disorders 10 11 casting doubt on the importance of hepsin in normal hemostasis. However it is possible that hepsin may contribute to fibrin formation in pathologic situations such as renal cell carcinoma 12 where the primary initiator of blood coagulation tissue factor 13 14 is absent. Furthermore other studies have suggested a functional link between hepsin and cellular growth. Depending on the tumor cell line and experimental conditions used hepsin has been reported to have growth promoting 15 or growth suppressing activity 16 . Additional information regarding hepsin can be found in inter alia PCT Pub. No. WO2004 009803 U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 482 630 6 423 543 5 981 830 U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2004 0009911 A1 U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2004 0001801 A1 U.S. Pat Appl. Pub. No. 2003 0223973 A1 U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2003 0175736 A1 U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2003 0013097 A1 also WO02 059373 U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2003 0049645 also WO02 064839 and U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2004 0132156.

Recent gene expression experiments identified hepsin as one of the most highly upregulated genes in prostate cancer 17 22 . In situ staining showed hepsin expression on epithelial cells of the prostate secretory glands 19 . The expression of hepsin correlated with the neoplastic transformation 19 being highest in tumors of patients with advanced disease and lowest in benign hyperplasia 18 22 . In contrast one study found that low expression of hepsin protein correlated with high Gleason scores and large tumors 20 . It is not clear whether this apparent contradiction is related to the methods used i.e. immunohistochemistry 20 vs. RNA quantification 18 22 . Furthermore hepsin is also strongly upregulated in ovarian cancer 23 and in renal cell carcinoma where it is mainly associated with the epithelial cell type 12 .

At the epithelial cell surface hepsin is ideally situated to interact with components of the extracellular matrix and other membrane associated proteins. Chymotrypsin like serine proteases including the TTSP matriptase synonym MT SP1 24 25 which is structurally related to hepsin are known to activate fibrinolytic enzymes matrix metalloproteases and latent forms of growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor HGF . HGF promotes cell proliferation migration angiogenesis survival and morphogenesis by activating the receptor tyrosine kinase Met reviewed in 26 27 . In addition to its importance in normal physiology the HGF Met pathway has been implicated in invasive tumor growth and tumor metastasis 26 . HGF has high similarity to the serine protease plasminogen and is composed of a chain containing an N domain and four Kringle domains and a chain with homology to chymotrypsin like proteases. It is secreted into the extracellular matrix as an inactive single chain precursor pro HGF and requires activation cleavage at Arg494 Val495 to form the biologically competent disulfide linked heterodimer 28 31 . This step is mediated by pro HGF converting serine proteases such as hepatocyte growth factor activator HGFA 32 matriptase 33 34 urokinase type plasminogen activator u PA 35 factor XIIa 36 factor XIa and plasma kallikrein 34 . HGFA and matriptase are inhibited by cell surface expressed Kunitz type inhibitors such as the two hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor splice variants HAI 1 37 38 and HAI 1B 34 and by HAI 2 39 . HAI 2 also known as placental bikunin 40 also potently inhibits factor XIa and plasma kallikrein 41 whereas HAI 1B has little or no inhibitory activity 34 . Therefore the biological availability of the pro HGF pool in the extracellular matrix is regulated by the activities of pro HGF convertases and their inhibitors.

The expression profile of hepsin in cancer tissues as described above coupled with its potential role in acting as a regulator of other growth factors the dysregulation of which might underlie carcinogenesis suggests that modulation of hepsin s interaction with its substrate could prove to be an efficacious therapeutic approach. In this regard there is a clear need to identify hepsin s physiological substrate and or its physiological modulator s . The invention fulfills this need and provides other benefits.

All references cited herein including patent applications and publications are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

As described herein a physiological substrate for hepsin a cell surface protein highly overexpressed in multiple cancers is hepatocyte growth factor which itself is known to play an important role in many aspects of cancer development. Hepsin is shown herein to cleave pro HGF with an activity comparable to the potent physiological pro HGF convertase HGFA hepatocyte growth factor activator . The two chain activated HGF generated by hepsin exhibits normal biological activities including induction of Met tyrosine phosphorylation stimulation of cell proliferation and stimulation of cell migration. In addition two Kunitz domain inhibitors HAI 1B and HAI 2 are identified herein as physiological regulators of hepsin enzymatic activity. The invention provides methods and compositions based at least in part on these findings which are described in greater detail below. It is shown that hepsin and its interaction with HGF and or its physiological inhibitors can be a unique and advantageous target for greater fine tuning in designing prophylatic and or therapeutic approaches against pathological conditions associated with abnormal or unwanted signaling of the HGF Met also referred to as c met pathway. Thus the invention provides methods compositions kits and articles of manufacture for identifying and for using substances that are capable of modulating the HGF c met pathway through modulation of physiological interacting molecules involved in the regulation of HGF activation.

Accordingly in one aspect the invention provides a method of screening for or identifying a candidate inhibitor i.e. antagonist substance that inhibits hepsin activation of HGF said method comprising a contacting a candidate substance with a first sample comprising hepsin and a pro HGF substrate and b comparing amount of pro HGF substrate activation in the sample with amount of pro HGF substrate activation in a reference sample comprising similar amounts of hepsin and pro HGF substrate as the first sample but that has not been contacted with said candidate substance whereby a decrease in amount of pro HGF substrate activation in the first sample compared to the reference sample indicates that the candidate substance is capable of inhibiting hepsin activation of single chain HGF pro HGF . In one embodiment hepsin in a sample is in an effective amount for activating said pro HGF. A pro HGF substrate suitable for use in these methods can be in a number of forms so long as it mimics the characteristic of the hepsin cleavage site on pro HGF. Examples of pro HGF substrate include but are not limited to full length single chain HGF comprising a wild type form of the R494 V495 peptide linkage and any fragment of HGF that comprises this peptide linkage. Such fragment can be any length for example at least about 5 7 10 15 20 25 amino acids in length or between about 4 and 25 5 and 20 7 and 15 amino acids in length. Generally and preferably a pro HGF substrate comprises a R494 V495 peptide bond capable of being cleaved by wild type hepsin. In one embodiment the pro HGF substrate comprises a cleavage site of human HGF that fits the consensus cleavage site of proteases i.e. basic residue at position Pand two hydrophobic amino acid residues in positions P and P PR494 P V495 P V496 .

In another aspect the invention provides a method of screening for a substance that blocks pro HGF activation by hepsin said method comprising screening for a substance that binds preferably but not necessarily specifically hepsin or pro HGF and blocks specific interaction e.g. binding between hepsin and pro HGF. In some embodiments the substance competes with hepsin for binding to HGF. In some embodiments the substance competes with pro HGF for binding to hepsin. In one embodiment the substance comprises consists or consists essentially of an amino acid sequence having at least about 60 70 80 90 95 99 sequence similarity or identity with respect to pro HGF e.g. human e.g. a fragment of human HGF comprising amino acid residues 494 Arg peptide linked to 495 Val . In some embodiments wherein the substance comprises consists or consists essentially of such an amino acid sequence the fragment is mutated or devoid of at least a portion of HGF beta chain such that said fragment has reduced c met activating activity compared to wild type HGF.

As would be evident to one skilled in the art screening assays consistent with those described above can also comprise a first step of screening based on a hepsin HGF complex formation readout to obtain a first set of candidate modulatory substance followed by a second step of screening based on ability of the first set of candidate modulatory substance to modulate activation of HGF and or conversion of HGF into a form that is capable of activating the HGF c met pathway. Suitable readouts can be any that would be evident to one skilled in the art based on a knowledge of enzyme substrate complex formation and or biological activities associated with the HGF c met signaling pathway. Enzyme substrate complex formation can be measured using for example routine biochemical assays e.g. gel electrophoresis chromatography NMR etc. . HGF c met biological activities include but are not limited to C met phosphorylation phosphorylation of cellular molecules that are substrates of C met kinase cellular growth proliferation survival etc. angiogenesis cell migration cell morphogenesis etc.

In one aspect the invention provides HGF c met antagonists that disrupt the HGF c met signaling pathway. For example the invention provides a molecule that inhibits hepsin cleavage of pro HGF e.g. cleavage at the R494 V495 position . The molecule can exert its inhibitory function in any number of ways including but not limited to binding to either hepsin or pro HGF such that hepsin cleavage of pro HGF is inhibited binding to hepsin pro HGF complex such that cleavage of pro HGF is inhibited and or binding to pro HGF or hepsin singly or in complex such that effects of HGF cleavage by hepsin is inhibited e.g. inhibition of release of HGF subsequent to cleavage by hepsin . In one embodiment an antagonist molecule of the invention does not inhibit HGF binding to c met. For example in one embodiment an antagonist molecule of the invention is not an antibody or fragment thereof having similar inhibitory and or binding ability as the antibody produced by hybridoma cell line deposited under American Type Culture Collection Accession Number ATCC HB 11894 hybridoma 1A3.3.13 or HB 11895 hybridoma 5D5.11.6 . In one embodiment an antagonist molecule of the invention inhibits biological activities associated with HGF c met activation.

In one aspect an antagonist of the invention is derived from the discovery described herein that hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors HAI 1 HAI 1B HAI 2 are potent inhibitors of hepsin activation of pro HGF. In one embodiment the invention provides an antagonist of pro HGF activation by hepsin said antagonist comprising at least a portion including all of human HAI 1 HAI 1B or HAI 2. In one embodiment said portion comprises a Kunitz domain KD sequence capable of inhibiting pro HGF activation by hepsin. In one embodiment said Kunitz domain sequence is Kunitz domain 1 KD1 of HAI 1 or HAI 1B. In one embodiment an antagonist of the invention comprises a variant KD1 sequence having at least about 70 75 80 85 90 95 97 98 99 sequence identity with wild type KD1 of human HAI 1 wherein said variant sequence has at least comparable ability as wild type KD1 in inhibiting hepsin cleavage of human pro HGF. In one embodiment an antagonist of the invention comprises a variant KD1 sequence having between about 70 and 99 about 75 and 98 about 80 and 97 85 and 95 sequence identity with wild type KD1 of human HAI 1 wherein said sequence has at least comparable ability as wild type KD1 in inhibiting hepsin cleavage of human pro HGF.

In one embodiment an antagonist of the invention comprises a variant HAI 2 Kunitz domain sequence having at least about 70 75 80 85 90 95 97 98 99 sequence identity with the corresponding Kunitz domain s of wild type human HAI 2 wherein said variant sequence has at least comparable ability as wild type HAI 2 in inhibiting hepsin cleavage of human pro HGF. In one embodiment an antagonist of the invention comprises a variant HAI 2 Kunitz domain sequence having between about 70 and 99 about 75 and 98 about 80 and 97 85 and 95 sequence identity with the corresponding Kunitz domain s of wild type human HAI 2 wherein said sequence has at least comparable ability as wild type HAI 2 in inhibiting hepsin cleavage of human pro HGF.

In some embodiments an antagonist of the invention is or comprises a small molecule peptide antibody antibody fragment aptamer or a combination thereof. Antagonists as described herein can be routinely obtained using techniques known in the art including those described in greater detail below based on the discovery of the interaction of hepsin hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors and pro HGF as described herein. For example in some embodiments an antagonist of the invention competes with hepsin for binding to HGF but does not have ability to cleave pro HGF at the hepsin cleavage site. In some embodiments an antagonist of the invention competes with pro HGF for binding to hepsin. For example in one embodiment said antagonist comprises consists or consists essentially of an amino acid sequence having at least about 60 70 80 90 95 98 99 sequence similarity or identity with respect to pro HGF e.g. human and is capable of substantially binding hepsin but lacks a hepsin cleavage site e.g. a Psite comprising the wild type human HGF R494 V495 peptide link and or lacks ability to activate c met e.g. wherein the HGF chain is mutated is devoid of HGF chain or portion thereof etc. . In one embodiment an antagonist of the invention comprises consists or consists essentially of an HGF fragment capable of binding hepsin wherein said fragment is devoid of at least a portion of HGF chain such that said fragment has reduced c met activating activity compared to wild type HGF.

Thus the invention provides an HGF mutant capable of substantially binding hepsin but has decreased HGF c met modulatory activity compared to wild type HGF e.g. an antagonist of HGF c met activity or an HGF variant exhibiting a reduction but not an absence of HGF biological activity e.g. cell growth stimulatory activity . In one embodiment an antagonist of the invention is capable of inhibiting the biological activity of wild type in vivo HGF such biological activity includes but is not limited to stimulation of cell proliferation enhancement of cell survival promotion of angiogenesis induction promotion of cell migration .

For example an enhancer molecule of the invention may comprise consist or consist essentially of a fragment or variant thereof of HAI 1 HAI 1B and or HAI 2 wherein said fragment is capable of binding to hepsin but does not substantially inhibit hepsin cleavage of pro HGF. In one embodiment said molecule is capable of competitively inhibiting binding of wild type HAI 1 HAI 1B and or HAI 2 to hepsin. In one embodiment an enhancer molecule of the invention is an antibody that interferes with formation of a complex comprising hepsin and HAI 1 HAI 1B and or HAI 2.

Optionally hepsin variant polypeptides will have no more than one conservative amino acid substitution as compared to a native hepsin polypeptide sequence alternatively no more than 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 conservative amino acid substitution as compared to the native hepsin polypeptide sequence.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to a peptide or polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein however amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 828 146.

The term vector as used herein is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply recombinant vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.

 Polynucleotide or nucleic acid as used interchangeably herein refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length and include DNA and RNA. The nucleotides can be deoxyribonucleotides ribonucleotides modified nucleotides or bases and or their analogs or any substrate that can be incorporated into a polymer by DNA or RNA polymerase or by a synthetic reaction. A polynucleotide may comprise modified nucleotides such as methylated nucleotides and their analogs. If present modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include for example caps substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog internucleotide modifications such as for example those with uncharged linkages e.g. methyl phosphonates phosphotriesters phosphoamidates carbamates etc. and with charged linkages e.g. phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates etc. those containing pendant moieties such as for example proteins e.g. nucleases toxins antibodies signal peptides ply L lysine etc. those with intercalators e.g. acridine psoralen etc. those containing chelators e.g. metals radioactive metals boron oxidative metals etc. those containing alkylators those with modified linkages e.g. alpha anomeric nucleic acids etc. as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide s . Further any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced for example by phosphonate groups phosphate groups protected by standard protecting groups or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or may be conjugated to solid or semi solid supports. The 5 and 3 terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art including for example 2 O methyl 2 O allyl 2 fluoro or 2 azido ribose carbocyclic sugar analogs .alpha. anomeric sugars epimeric sugars such as arabinose xyloses or lyxoses pyranose sugars furanose sugars sedoheptuloses acyclic analogs and abasic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside. One or more phosphodiester linkages may be replaced by alternative linking groups. These alternative linking groups include but are not limited to embodiments wherein phosphate is replaced by P O S thioate P S S dithioate O NR.sub.2 amidate P O R P O OR CO or CH.sub.2 formacetal in which each R or R is independently H or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl 1 20 C. optionally containing an ether O linkage aryl alkenyl cycloalkyl cycloalkenyl or araldyl. Not all linkages in a polynucleotide need be identical. The preceding description applies to all polynucleotides referred to herein including RNA and DNA.

An antibody can be human humanized and or affinity matured.

 Antibody fragments comprise only a portion of an intact antibody wherein the portion preferably retains at least one preferably most or all of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. In one embodiment an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment an antibody fragment for example one that comprises the Fc region retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody such as FcRn binding antibody half life modulation ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For e.g. such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.

The term monoclonal antibody as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific being directed against a single antigen. Furthermore in contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations that typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants epitopes each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen.

The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include chimeric antibodies in which a portion of the heavy and or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 .

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues.

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al 226 889 896 1992 .

An effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.

A therapeutically effective amount of a substance molecule of the invention agonist or antagonist may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily since a prophylactic dose is used in subjects prior to or at an earlier stage of disease the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

Also included in this definition are anti hormonal agents that act to regulate reduce block or inhibit the effects of hormones that can promote the growth of cancer and are often in the form of systemic or whole body treatment. They may be hormones themselves. Examples include anti estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators SERMs including for example tamoxifen including NOLVADEX tamoxifen raloxifene EVISTA droloxifene 4 hydroxytamoxifen trioxifene keoxifene LY117018 onapristone and toremifene FARESTON anti progesterones estrogen receptor down regulators ERDs estrogen receptor antagonists such as fulvestrant FASLODEX agents that function to suppress or shut down the ovaries for example leutinizing hormone releasing hormone LHRH agonists such as leuprolide acetate LUPRON and ELIGARD goserelin acetate buserelin acetate and tripterelin other anti androgens such as flutamide nilutamide and bicalutamide and aromatase inhibitors that inhibit the enzyme aromatase which regulates estrogen production in the adrenal glands such as for example 4 5 inmidazoles aminoglutethimide megestrol acetate MEGASE exemestane AROMASIN formestanie fadrozole vorozole RIVISOR letrozole FEMARA and anastrozole ARIMIDEX . In addition such definition of chemotherapeutic agents includes bisphosphonates such as clodronate for example BONEFOS or OSTAC etidronate DIDROCAL NE 58095 zoledronic acid zoledronate ZOMETA alendronate FOSAMAX pamidronate AREDIA tiludronate SKELID or risedronate ACTONEL as well as troxacitabine a 1 3 dioxolane nucleoside cytosine analog antisense oligonucleotides particularly those that inhibit expression of genes in signaling pathways implicated in abherant cell proliferation such as for example PKC alpha Raf H Ras and epidermal growth factor receptor EGF R vaccines such as THERATOPE vaccine and gene therapy vaccines for example ALLOVECTIN vaccine LEUVECTIN vaccine and VAXID vaccine topoisomerase 1 inhibitor e.g. LURTOTECAN rmRH e.g. ABARELIX lapatinib ditosylate an ErbB 2 and EGFR dual tyrosine kinase small molecule inhibitor also known as GW572016 COX 2 inhibitors such as celecoxib CELEBREX 4 5 4 methylphenyl 3 trifluoromethyl 1H pyrazol 1 yl benzenesulfonamide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of any of the above.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell whose growth is dependent upon HGF c met activation either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of HGF c met dependent cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C. Further information can be found in Mendelsohn and Israel eds. Chapter 1 entitled Cell cycle regulation oncogenes and antineoplastic drugs by Murakami et al. WB Saunders Philadelphia 1995 especially p. 13. The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel TAXOTERE Rhone Poulenc Rorer derived from the European yew is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb . Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.

 Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic. The full chemical name of doxorubicin is 8S cis 10 3 amino 2 3 6 trideoxy L lyxo hexapyranosyl oxy 7 8 9 10 tetrahydro 6 8 11 trihydroxy 8 hydroxyacetyl 1 methoxy 5 12 naphthacenedione.

In one embodiment the present invention provides antibodies which may find use herein as therapeutic and or diagnostic agents. Exemplary antibodies include polyclonal monoclonal humanized bispecific and heteroconjugate antibodies.

Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen especially when synthetic peptides are used to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized. For example the antigen can be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH serum albumin bovine thyroglobulin or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent e.g. maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester conjugation through cysteine residues N hydroxysuccinimide through lysine residues glutaraldehyde succinic anhydride SOCl or RN C NR where R and Rare different alkyl groups.

Animals are immunized against the antigen immunogenic conjugates or derivatives by combining e.g. 100 g or 5 g of the protein or conjugate for rabbits or mice respectively with 3 volumes of Freund s complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with to 1 10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund s complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.

Monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized as described above to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. After immunization lymphocytes are isolated and then fused with a myeloma cell line using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium which medium preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells also referred to as fusion partner . For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the selective culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred fusion partner myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a selective medium that selects against the unfused parental cells. Preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 and derivatives e.g. X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Manassas Va. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 and Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis described in Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

Once hybridoma cells that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity are identified the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp.59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal e.g by i.p. injection of the cells into mice.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional antibody purification procedures such as for example affinity chromatography e.g. using protein A or protein G Sepharose or ion exchange chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis etc.

DNA encoding the monoclonal antibodies is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of murine antibodies . The hybridoma cells serve as a preferred source of such DNA. Once isolated the DNA may be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce antibody protein to obtain the synthesis of monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of DNA encoding the antibody include Skerra et al. 5 256 262 1993 and Pl ckthun 130 151 188 1992 .

In a further embodiment monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments can be isolated from antibody phage libraries generated using the techniques described in McCafferty et al. 348 552 554 1990 . Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 and Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 describe the isolation of murine and human antibodies respectively using phage libraries. Subsequent publications describe the production of high affinity nM range human antibodies by chain shuffling Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 as well as combinatorial infection and in vivo recombination as a strategy for constructing very large phage libraries Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . Thus these techniques are viable alternatives to traditional monoclonal antibody hybridoma techniques for isolation of monoclonal antibodies.

The DNA that encodes the antibody may be modified to produce chimeric or fusion antibody polypeptides for example by substituting human heavy chain and light chain constant domain Cand C sequences for the homologous murine sequences U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 1984 or by fusing the immunoglobulin coding sequence with all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide heterologous polypeptide . The non immunoglobulin polypeptide sequences can substitute for the constant domains of an antibody or they are substituted for the variable domains of one antigen combining site of an antibody to create a chimeric bivalent antibody comprising one antigen combining site having specificity for an antigen and another antigen combining site having specificity for a different antigen.

The antibodies of the invention may further comprise humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric immunoglobulins immunoglobulin chains or fragments thereof such as Fv Fab Fab F ab or other antigen binding subsequences of antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. Humanized antibodies include human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a complementary determining region CDR of the recipient are replaced by residues from a CDR of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat or rabbit having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances Fv framework residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Humanized antibodies may also comprise residues which are found neither in the recipient antibody nor in the imported CDR or framework sequences. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the CDR regions correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody optimally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 329 1988 and Presta 2 593 596 1992 .

Methods for humanizing non human antibodies are well known in the art. Generally a humanized antibody has one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. 332 323 327 1988 Verhoeyen et al. 239 1534 1536 1988 by substituting rodent CDRs or CDR sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some CDR residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity and HAMA response human anti mouse antibody when the antibody is intended for human therapeutic use. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human V domain sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is identified and the human framework region FR within it accepted for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 151 2296 1993 Chothia et al. 196 901 1987 . Another method uses a particular framework region derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 89 4285 1992 Presta et al. 151 2623 1993 .

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high binding affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to a preferred method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Various forms of a humanized antibody are contemplated. For example the humanized antibody may be an antibody fragment such as a Fab which is optionally conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent s in order to generate an immunoconjugate. Alternatively the humanized antibody may be an intact antibody such as an intact IgG1 antibody.

As an alternative to humanization human antibodies can be generated. For example it is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region JH gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array into such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 258 1993 Bruggemann et al. 7 33 1993 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 545 806 5 569 825 5 591 669 all of GenPharm 5 545 807 and WO 97 17852.

Alternatively phage display technology McCafferty et al. 348 552 553 1990 can be used to produce human antibodies and antibody fragments in vitro from immunoglobulin variable V domain gene repertoires from unimmunized donors. According to this technique antibody V domain genes are cloned in frame into either a major or minor coat protein gene of a filamentous bacteriophage such as M13 or fd and displayed as functional antibody fragments on the surface of the phage particle. Because the filamentous particle contains a single stranded DNA copy of the phage genome selections based on the functional properties of the antibody also result in selection of the gene encoding the antibody exhibiting those properties. Thus the phage mimics some of the properties of the B cell. Phage display can be performed in a variety of formats reviewed in e.g. Johnson Kevin S. and Chiswell David J. 3 564 571 1993 . Several sources of V gene segments can be used for phage display. Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 isolated a diverse array of anti oxazolone antibodies from a small random combinatorial library of V genes derived from the spleens of immunized mice. A repertoire of V genes from unimmunized human donors can be constructed and antibodies to a diverse array of antigens including self antigens can be isolated essentially following the techniques described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or Griffith et al. 12 725 734 1993 . See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 565 332 and 5 573 905.

As discussed above human antibodies may also be generated by in vitro activated B cells see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 567 610 and 5 229 275 .

In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv . See WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458. Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870 for example. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

Bispecific antibodies are antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different epitopes. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of hepsin HGF and or hepsin HGF complex as described herein. Other such antibodies may combine a binding site on these entities with a binding site for another polypeptide. Alternatively an antibody arm may be combined with an arm which binds to a triggering molecule on a leukocyte such as a T cell receptor molecule e.g. CD3 or Fc receptors for IgG Fc R such as Fc RI CD64 Fc RII CD32 and Fc RIII CD16 so as to focus and localize cellular defense mechanisms to the hepsin and or HGF expressing and or binding cell. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express and or bind hepsin HGF and or hepsin HGF complex. These antibodies possess a polypeptide binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

WO 96 16673 describes a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RIII antibody and U.S. Pat. No. 5 837 234 discloses a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti Fc RI antibody. A bispecific anti ErbB2 Fc antibody is shown in WO98 02463. U.S. Pat. No. 5 821 337 teaches a bispecific anti ErbB2 anti CD3 antibody.

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditional production of full length bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two chains have different specificities Millstein et al. 305 537 539 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. Purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 3659 1991 .

According to a different approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. Preferably the fusion is with an Ig heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge C2 and C3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region C1 containing the site necessary for light chain bonding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host cell. This provides for greater flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yield of the desired bispecific antibody. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains into a single expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios have no significant affect on the yield of the desired chain combination.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 731 168 the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HWV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the ErbB2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets. Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a Vconnected to a Vby a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the Vand Vdomains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary Vand Vdomains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

Heteroconjugate antibodies are also within the scope of the present invention. Heteroconjugate antibodies are composed of two covalently joined antibodies. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 200373 EP 03089 . It is contemplated that the antibodies may be prepared in vitro using known methods in synthetic protein chemistry including those involving crosslinking agents. For example immunotoxins may be constructed using a disulfide exchange reaction or by forming a thioether bond. Examples of suitable reagents for this purpose include iminothiolate and methyl4 mercaptobutyrimidate and those disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980.

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fc region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises or consists of three to about eight but preferably four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain and preferably two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 VD2 X2 Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two and preferably four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

It may be desirable to modify the antibody of the invention with respect to effector function e.g. so as to enhance antigen dependent cell mediated cyotoxicity ADCC and or complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC of the antibody. This may be achieved by introducing one or more amino acid substitutions in an Fc region of the antibody. Alternatively or additionally cysteine residue s may be introduced in the Fc region thereby allowing interchain disulfide bond formation in this region. The homodimeric antibody thus generated may have improved internalization capability and or increased complement mediated cell killing and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC . See Caron et al. 176 1191 1195 1992 and Shopes B. 148 2918 2922 1992 . Homodimeric antibodies with enhanced anti tumor activity may also be prepared using heterobifunctional cross linkers as described in Wolff et al. 53 2560 2565 1993 . Alternatively an antibody can be engineered which has dual Fc regions and may thereby have enhanced complement lysis and ADCC capabilities. See Stevenson et al. 3 219 230 1989 . To increase the serum half life of the antibody one may incorporate a salvage receptor binding epitope into the antibody especially an antibody fragment as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 739 277 for example. As used herein the term salvage receptor binding epitope refers to an epitope of the Fc region of an IgG molecule e.g. IgG IgG IgG or IgG that is responsible for increasing the in vivo serum half life of the IgG molecule.

The invention also pertains to immunoconjugates or antibody drug conjugates ADC comprising an antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

Drg Del. Rev. 26 151 172 U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278 theoretically allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. 1986 Lancet pp. Mar. 15 1986 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications A. Pinchera et al. ed.s pp. 475 506 . Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 1986 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21 183 87 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al 2000 Bioorganic Med. Chem. Letters 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al 2002 Bioconjugate Chem. 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 and calicheamicin Lode et al 1998 Cancer Res. 58 2928 Hinman et al 1993 Cancer Res. 53 3336 3342 . The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of such immunoconjugates have been described above. Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCI active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids a trichothecene and CC1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In one embodiment an antibody full length or fragments of the invention is conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub Maytenus serrata U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference.

In an attempt to improve their therapeutic index maytansine and maytansinoids have been conjugated to antibodies specifically binding to tumor cell antigens. Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansonoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 10HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 and Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 . The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

Another imrnunoconjugate of interest comprises an antibody conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof which can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S momordica charantia inhibitor curcin crotin sapaonaria officinalis inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tcor I or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging mri such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcor I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

The compounds of the invention expressly contemplate but are not limited to ADC prepared with cross linker reagents BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA SIAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo SIAB sulfo SMCC and sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. U.S.A . See pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

In the antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Ab L D I

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol.

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic subsituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either glactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 Bioconjugate Chem. 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters halofornates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the patient followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

The antibodies disclosed herein may also be formulated as immunoliposomes. A liposome is a small vesicle composed of various types of lipids phospholipids and or surfactant which is useful for delivery of a drug to a mammal. The components of the liposome are commonly arranged in a bilayer formation similar to the lipid arrangement of biological membranes. Liposomes containing the antibody are prepared by methods known in the art such as described in Epstein et al. 82 3688 1985 Hwang et al. 77 4030 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 485 045 and 4 544 545 and WO97 38731 published Oct. 23 1997. Liposomes with enhanced circulation time are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 013 556.

Particularly useful liposomes can be generated by the reverse phase evaporation method with a lipid composition comprising phosphatidylcholine cholesterol and PEG derivatized phosphatidylethanolamine PEG PE . Liposomes are extruded through filters of defined pore size to yield liposomes with the desired diameter. Fab fragments of the antibody of the present invention can be conjugated to the liposomes as described in Martin et al. 257 286 288 1982 via a disulfide interchange reaction. A chemotherapeutic agent is optionally contained within the liposome. See Gabizon et al. 81 19 1484 1989 .

Binding oligopeptides of the invention are oligopeptides that bind preferably specifically to hepsin HGF and or hepsin HGF complex as described herein. Binding oligopeptides may be chemically synthesized using known oligopeptide synthesis methodology or may be prepared and purified using recombinant technology. Binding oligopeptides are usually at least about 5 amino acids in length alternatively at least about 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 or 100 amino acids in length or more wherein such oligopeptides that are capable of binding preferably specifically to a polypeptide as described herein. Binding oligopeptides may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard it is noted that techniques for screening oligopeptide libraries for oligopeptides that are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 556 762 5 750 373 4 708 871 4 833 092 5 223 409 5 403 484 5 571 689 5 663 143 PCT Publication Nos. WO 84 03506 and WO84 03564 Geysen et al. 81 3998 4002 1984 Geysen et al. 82 178 182 1985 Geysen et al. in Synthetic Peptides as Antigens 130 149 1986 Geysen et al. 102 259 274 1987 Schoofs et al. 140 611 616 1988 Cwirla S.

In this regard bacteriophage phage display is one well known technique which allows one to screen large oligopeptide libraries to identify member s of those libraries which are capable of specifically binding to a polypeptide target. Phage display is a technique by which variant polypeptides are displayed as fusion proteins to the coat protein on the surface of bacteriophage particles Scott J. K. and Smith G. P. 1990 249 386 . The utility of phage display lies in the fact that large libraries of selectively randomized protein variants or randomly cloned cDNAs can be rapidly and efficiently sorted for those sequences that bind to a target molecule with high affinity. Display of peptide Cwirla S. E. et al. 1990 87 6378 or protein Lowman H. B. et al. 1991 30 10832 Clackson T. et al. 1991 352 624 Marks J. D. et al. 1991 222 581 Kang A.S. et al. 1991 88 8363 libraries on phage have been used for screening millions of polypeptides or oligopeptides for ones with specific binding properties Smith G. P. 1991 2 668 . Sorting phage libraries of random mutants requires a strategy for constructing and propagating a large number of variants a procedure for affinity purification using the target receptor and a means of evaluating the results of binding enrichments.

Although most phage display methods have used filamentous phage lambdoid phage display systems WO 95 34683 U.S. Pat.

Many other improvements and variations of the basic phage display concept have now been developed. These improvements enhance the ability of display systems to screen peptide libraries for binding to selected target molecules and to display functional proteins with the potential of screening these proteins for desired properties. Combinatorial reaction devices for phage display reactions have been developed WO 98 14277 and phage display libraries have been used to analyze and control bimolecular interactions WO 98 20169 WO 98 20159 and properties of constrained helical peptides WO 98 20036 . WO 97 35196 describes a method of isolating an affinity ligand in which a phage display library is contacted with one solution in which the ligand will bind to a target molecule and a second solution in which the affinity ligand will not bind to the target molecule to selectively isolate binding ligands. WO 97 46251 describes a method of biopanning a random phage display library with an affinity purified antibody and then isolating binding phage followed by a micropanning process using microplate wells to isolate high affinity binding phage. The use of protein A as an affinity tag has also been reported Li et al. 1998 Mol Biotech. 9 187 . WO 97 47314 describes the use of substrate subtraction libraries to distinguish enzyme specificities using a combinatorial library which may be a phage display library. A method for selecting enzymes suitable for use in detergents using phage display is described in WO 97 09446. Additional methods of selecting specific binding proteins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 498 538 5 432 018 and WO 98 15833.

Methods of generating peptide libraries and screening these libraries are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 723 286 5 432 018 5 580 717 5 427 908 5 498 530 5 770 434 5 734 018 5 698 426 5 763 192 and 5 723 323.

Binding small molecules are preferably organic molecules other than oligopeptides or antibodies as defined herein that bind preferably specifically to hepsin HGF and or hepsin HGF complex as described herein. Binding organic small molecules may be identified and chemically synthesized using known methodology see e.g. PCT Publication Nos. WO00 00823 and WO00 39585 . Binding organic small molecules are usually less than about 2000 daltons in size alternatively less than about 1500 750 500 250 or 200 daltons in size wherein such organic small molecules that are capable of binding preferably specifically to a polypeptide as described herein may be identified without undue experimentation using well known techniques. In this regard it is noted that techniques for screening organic small molecule libraries for molecules that are capable of binding to a polypeptide target are well known in the art see e.g. PCT Publication Nos. WO00 00823 and WO00 39585 . Binding organic small molecules may be for example aldehydes ketones oximes hydrazones semicarbazones carbazides primary amines secondary amines tertiary amines N substituted hydrazines hydrazides alcohols ethers thiols thioethers disulfides carboxylic acids esters amides ureas carbamates carbonates ketals thioketals acetals thioacetals aryl halides aryl sulfonates alkyl halides alkyl sulfonates aromatic compounds heterocyclic compounds anilines alkenes alkynes diols amino alcohols oxazolidines oxazolines thiazolidines thiazolines enamines sulfonamides epoxides aziridines isocyanates sulfonyl chlorides diazo compounds acid chlorides or the like.

D. Screening for Antibodies Binding Oligopeptides and Binding Small Molecules with the Desired Properties

Techniques for generating antibodies oligopeptides and small molecules of the invention have been described above. One may further select antibodies oligopeptides or other small molecules with certain biological characteristics as desired.

The growth inhibitory effects of an antibody oligopeptide or other small molecule of the invention may be assessed by methods known in the art e.g. using cells which express hepsin and or pro HGF either endogenously or following transfection with the respective gene s . For example appropriate tumor cell lines and hepsin and or HGF polypeptide transfected cells may be treated with a monoclonal antibody oligopeptide or other small molecule of the invention at various concentrations for a few days e.g. 2 7 days and stained with crystal violet or MTT or analyzed by some other colorimetric assay. Another method of measuring proliferation would be by comparing H thymidine uptake by the cells treated in the presence or absence an antibody binding oligopeptide or binding small molecule of the invention. After treatment the cells are harvested and the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the DNA quantitated in a scintillation counter. Appropriate positive controls include treatment of a selected cell line with a growth inhibitory antibody known to inhibit growth of that cell line. Growth inhibition of tumor cells in vivo can be determined in various ways known in the art. The tumor cell may be one that overexpresses a hepsin and or pro HGF polypeptide. The antibody binding oligopeptide or binding organic small molecule will inhibit cell proliferation of a hepsin and or HGF expressing tumor cell in vitro or in vivo by about 25 100 compared to the untreated tumor cell more preferably by about 30 100 and even more preferably by about 50 100 or 70 100 in one embodiment at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml. Growth inhibition can be measured at an antibody concentration of about 0.5 to 30 g ml or about 0.5 nM to 200 nM in cell culture where the growth inhibition is determined 1 10 days after exposure of the tumor cells to the antibody. The antibody is growth inhibitory in vivo if administration of the antibody at about 1 g kg to about 100 mg kg body weight results in reduction in tumor size or reduction of tumor cell proliferation within about 5 days to 3 months from the first administration of the antibody preferably within about 5 to 30 days.

To select for an antibody binding oligopeptide or binding organic small molecule which induces cell death loss of membrane integrity as indicated by e.g. propidium iodide PI trypan blue or 7AAD uptake may be assessed relative to control. A PI uptake assay can be performed in the absence of complement and immune effector cells. Hepsin and or pro HGF polypeptide expressing tumor cells are incubated with medium alone or medium containing the appropriate antibody e.g at about 10 g ml binding oligopeptide or binding organic small molecule. The cells are incubated for a 3 day time period. Following each treatment cells are washed and aliquoted into 35 mm strainer capped 12 75 tubes 1 ml per tube 3 tubes per treatment group for removal of cell clumps. Tubes then receive PI 10 g ml . Samples may be analyzed using a FACSCAN flow cytometer and FACSCONVERT CellQuest software Becton Dickinson . Those antibodies binding oligopeptides or binding organic small molecules that induce statistically significant levels of cell death as determined by PI uptake may be selected as cell death inducing antibodies binding oligopeptides or binding organic small molecules.

To screen for antibodies oligopeptides or other organic small molecules which bind to an epitope on a polypeptide bound by an antibody of interest a routine cross blocking assay such as that described in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Ed Harlow and David Lane 1988 can be performed. This assay can be used to determine if a test antibody oligopeptide or other organic small molecule binds the same site or epitope as a known antibody. Alternatively or additionally epitope mapping can be performed by methods known in the art. For example the antibody sequence can be mutagenized such as by alanine scanning to identify contact residues. The mutant antibody is initially tested for binding with polyclonal antibody to ensure proper folding. In a different method peptides corresponding to different regions of a polypeptide can be used in competition assays with the test antibodies or with a test antibody and an antibody with a characterized or known epitope.

The antibodies of the present invention may also be used in ADEPT by conjugating the antibody to a prodrug activating enzyme which converts a prodrug e.g. a peptidyl chemotherapeutic agent see WO81 01145 to an active anti cancer drug. See for example WO 88 07378 and U.S. Pat. No. 4 975 278.

The enzyme component of the immunoconjugate useful for ADEPT includes any enzyme capable of acting on a prodrug in such a way so as to covert it into its more active cytotoxic form.

Enzymes that are useful in the method of this invention include but are not limited to alkaline phosphatase useful for converting phosphate containing prodrugs into free drugs arylsulfatase useful for converting sulfate containing prodrugs into free drugs cytosine deaminase useful for converting non toxic 5 fluorocytosine into the anti cancer drug 5 fluorouracil proteases such as serratia protease thermolysin subtilisin carboxypeptidases and cathepsins such as cathepsins B and L that are useful for converting peptide containing prodrugs into free drugs D alanylcarboxypeptidases useful for converting prodrugs that contain D amino acid substituents carbohydrate cleaving enzymes such as galactosidase and neuraminidase useful for converting glycosylated prodrugs into free drugs lactamase useful for converting drugs derivatized with lactams into free drugs and penicillin amidases such as penicillin V amidase or penicillin G amidase useful for converting drugs derivatized at their amine nitrogens with phenoxyacetyl or phenylacetyl groups respectively into free drugs. Alternatively antibodies with enzymatic activity also known in the art as abzymes can be used to convert the prodrugs of the invention into free active drugs see e.g. Massey 328 457 458 1987 . Antibody abzyme conjugates can be prepared as described herein for delivery of the abzyme to a tumor cell population.

The enzymes of this invention can be covalently bound to the antibodies by techniques well known in the art such as the use of the heterobifunctional crosslinking reagents discussed above. Alternatively fusion proteins comprising at least the antigen binding region of an antibody of the invention linked to at least a functionally active portion of an enzyme of the invention can be constructed using recombinant DNA techniques well known in the art see e.g. Neuberger et al. 312 604 608 1984 .

In addition to the antibodies described herein it is contemplated that antibody variants can be prepared. Antibody variants can be prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the encoding DNA and or by synthesis of the desired antibody. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that amino acid changes may alter post translational processes of the antibody such as changing the number or position of glycosylation sites or altering the membrane anchoring characteristics.

Variations in the antibodies described herein can be made for example using any of the techniques and guidelines for conservative and non conservative mutations set forth for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 5 364 934. Variations may be a substitution deletion or insertion of one or more codons encoding the antibody that results in a change in the amino acid sequence as compared with the native sequence antibody or polypeptide. Optionally the variation is by substitution of at least one amino acid with any other amino acid in one or more of the domains of the antibody. Guidance in determining which amino acid residue may be inserted substituted or deleted without adversely affecting the desired activity may be found by comparing the sequence of the antibody with that of homologous known protein molecules and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology. Amino acid substitutions can be the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and or chemical properties such as the replacement of a leucine with a serine i.e. conservative amino acid replacements. Insertions or deletions may optionally be in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The variation allowed may be determined by systematically making insertions deletions or substitutions of amino acids in the sequence and testing the resulting variants for activity exhibited by the parent sequence.

Antibody and polypeptide fragments are provided herein. Such fragments may be truncated at the N terminus or C terminus or may lack internal residues for example when compared with a full length native antibody or protein. Certain fragments lack amino acid residues that are not essential for a desired biological activity of the antibody or polypeptide.

Antibody and polypeptide fragments may be prepared by any of a number of conventional techniques. Desired peptide fragments may be chemically synthesized. An alternative approach involves generating antibody or polypeptide fragments by enzymatic digestion e.g. by treating the protein with an enzyme known to cleave proteins at sites defined by particular amino acid residues or by digesting the DNA with suitable restriction enzymes and isolating the desired fragment. Yet another suitable technique involves isolating and amplifying a DNA fragment encoding a desired antibody or polypeptide fragment by polymerase chain reaction PCR . Oligonucleotides that define the desired termini of the DNA fragment are employed at the 5 and 3 primers in the PCR. Preferably antibody and polypeptide fragments share at least one biological and or immunological activity with the native antibody or polypeptide disclosed herein.

In particular embodiments conservative substitutions of interest are shown in the table below under the heading of preferred substitutions. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in this table or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes are introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in function or immunological identity of the antibody or polypeptide are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Amino acids may be grouped according to similarities in the properties of their side chains in A. L. Lehninger in Biochemistry second ed. pp. 73 75 Worth Publishers New York 1975 

Alternatively naturally occurring residues may be divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class. Such substituted residues also may be introduced into the conservative substitution sites or more preferably into the remaining non conserved sites.

The variations can be made using methods known in the art such as oligonucleotide mediated site directed mutagenesis alanine scanning and PCR mutagenesis. Site directed mutagenesis Carter et al. 13 4331 1986 Zoller et al. 10 6487 1987 cassette mutagenesis Wells et al. 34 315 1985 restriction selection mutagenesis Wells et al. 317 415 1986 or other known techniques can be performed on the cloned DNA to produce the antibody or polypeptide variant DNA.

Scanning amino acid analysis can also be employed to identify one or more amino acids along a contiguous sequence. Among the preferred scanning amino acids are relatively small neutral amino acids. Such amino acids include alanine glycine serine and cysteine. Alanine is typically a preferred scanning amino acid among this group because it eliminates the side chain beyond the beta carbon and is less likely to alter the main chain conformation of the variant Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . Alanine is also typically preferred because it is the most common amino acid. Further it is frequently found in both buried and exposed positions Creighton W.H. Freeman Co. N.Y. Chothia 150 1 1976 . If alanine substitution does not yield adequate amounts of variant an isoteric amino acid can be used.

Any cysteine residue not involved in maintaining the proper conformation of the antibody or polypeptide also may be substituted generally with serine to improve the oxidative stability of the molecule and prevent aberrant crosslinking. Conversely cysteine bond s may be added to the antibody or polypeptide to improve its stability particularly where the antibody is an antibody fragment such as an Fv fragment .

A particularly preferred type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino substitutions at each site. The antibody variants thus generated are displayed in a monovalent fashion from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen polypeptide. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

Covalent modifications of antibodies and polypeptides are included within the scope of this invention. One type of covalent modification includes reacting targeted amino acid residues of an antibody or polypeptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or the N or C terminal residues of the antibody or polypeptide. Derivatization with bifunctional agents is useful for instance for crosslinking antibody or polypeptide to a water insoluble support matrix or surface for use in the method for purifying antibodies and vice versa. Commonly used crosslinking agents include e.g. 1 1 bis diazoacetyl 2 phenylethane glutaraldehyde N hydroxysuccinimide esters for example esters with 4 azidosalicylic acid homobifunctional imidoesters including disuccinimidyl esters such as 3 3 dithiobis succinimidylpropionate bifunctional maleimides such as bis N maleimido 1 8 octane and agents such as methyl 3 p azidophenyl dithio propioimnidate.

Other modifications include deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues to the corresponding glutamyl and aspartyl residues respectively hydroxylation of proline and lysine phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups of seryl or threonyl residues methylation of the amino groups of lysine arginine and histidine side chains T. E. Creighton W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco pp. 79 86 1983 acetylation of the N terminal amine and amidation of any C terminal carboxyl group.

Another type of covalent modification of the antibody or polypeptide included within the scope of this invention comprises altering the native glycosylation pattern of the antibody or polypeptide. Altering the native glycosylation pattern is intended for purposes herein to mean deleting one or more carbohydrate moieties found in native sequence antibody or polypeptide either by removing the underlying glycosylation site or by deleting the glycosylation by chemical and or enzymatic means and or adding one or more glycosylation sites that are not present in the native sequence antibody or polypeptide. In addition the phrase includes qualitative changes in the glycosylation of the native proteins involving a change in the nature and proportions of the various carbohydrate moieties present.

Glycosylation of antibodies and other polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody or polypeptide is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody or polypeptide for 0 linked glycosylation sites . The antibody or polypeptide amino acid sequence may optionally be altered through changes at the DNA level particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the antibody or polypeptide at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids.

Another means of increasing the number of carbohydrate moieties on the antibody or polypeptide is by chemical or enzymatic coupling of glycosides to the polypeptide. Such methods are described in the art e.g. in WO 87 05330 published 11 Sep. 1987 and in Aplin and Wriston pp. 259 306 1981 .

Removal of carbohydrate moieties present on the antibody or polypeptide may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically or by mutational substitution of codons encoding for amino acid residues that serve as targets for glycosylation. Chemical deglycosylation techniques are known in the art and described for instance by Hakimuddin et al. 259 52 1987 and by Edge et al. 118 131 1981 . Enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo and exo glycosidases as described by Thotakura et al. 138 350 1987 .

Another type of covalent modification of antibody or polypeptide comprises linking the antibody or polypeptide to one of a variety of nonproteinaceous polymers e.g. polyethylene glycol PEG polypropylene glycol or polyoxyalkylenes in the manner set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 640 835 4 496 689 4 301 144 4 670 417 4 791 192 or 4 179 337. The antibody or polypeptide also may be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Oslo A. Ed. 1980 .

The antibody or polypeptide of the present invention may also be modified in a way to form chimeric molecules comprising an antibody or polypeptide fused to another heterologous polypeptide or amino acid sequence.

In one embodiment such a chimeric molecule comprises a fusion of the antibody or polypeptide with a tag polypeptide which provides an epitope to which an anti tag antibody can selectively bind. The epitope tag is generally placed at the amino or carboxyl terminus of the antibody or polypeptide. The presence of such epitope tagged forms of the antibody or polypeptide can be detected using an antibody against the tag polypeptide. Also provision of the epitope tag enables the antibody or polypeptide to be readily purified by affinity purification using an anti tag antibody or another type of affinity matrix that binds to the epitope tag. Various tag polypeptides and their respective antibodies are well known in the art. Examples include poly histidine poly his or poly histidine glycine poly his gly tags the flu HA tag polypeptide and its antibody 12CA5 Field et al. 8 2159 2165 1988 the c myc tag and the 8F9 3C7 6E10 G4 B7 and 9E10 antibodies thereto Evan et al. 5 3610 3616 1985 and the Herpes Simplex virus glycoprotein D gD tag and its antibody Paborsky et al. 3 6 547 553 1990 . Other tag polypeptides include the Flag peptide Hopp et al. 6 1204 1210 1988 the KT3 epitope peptide Martin et al. 255 192 194 1992 an tubulin epitope peptide Skinner et al. 266 15163 15166 1991 and the T7 gene 10 protein peptide tag Lutz Freyermuth et al. 87 6393 6397 1990 .

In an alternative embodiment the chimeric molecule may comprise a fusion of the antibody or polypeptide with an immunoglobulin or a particular region of an immunoglobulin. For a bivalent form of the chimeric molecule also referred to as an immunoadhesin such a fusion could be to the Fc region of an IgG molecule. The Ig fusions preferably include the substitution of a soluble transmembrane domain deleted or inactivated form of an antibody or polypeptide in place of at least one variable region within an Ig molecule. In a particularly preferred embodiment the immunoglobulin fusion includes the hinge CHand CH or the hinge CH CHand CHregions of an IgGI molecule. For the production of immunoglobulin fusions see also US Pat. No. 5 428 130 issued Jun. 27 1995.

The description below relates primarily to production of antibodies and polypeptides by culturing cells transformed or transfected with a vector containing antibody and polypeptide encoding nucleic acid. It is of course contemplated that alternative methods which are well known in the art may be employed to prepare antibodies and polypeptides. For instance the appropriate amino acid sequence or portions thereof may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid phase techniques see e.g. Stewart et al. W.H. Freeman Co. San Francisco Calif. 1969 Merrifield 85 2149 2154 1963 . In vitro protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be accomplished for instance using an Applied Biosystems Peptide Synthesizer Foster City Calif. using manufacturer s instructions. Various portions of the antibody or polypeptide may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical or enzymatic methods to produce the desired antibody or polypeptide.

DNA encoding antibody or polypeptide may be obtained from a cDNA library prepared from tissue believed to possess the antibody or polypeptide mRNA and to express it at a detectable level. Accordingly human antibody or polypeptide DNA can be conveniently obtained from a cDNA library prepared from human tissue. The antibody or polypeptide encoding gene may also be obtained from a genomic library or by known synthetic procedures e.g. automated nucleic acid synthesis .

Libraries can be screened with probes such as oligonucleotides of at least about 20 80 bases designed to identify the gene of interest or the protein encoded by it. Screening the cDNA or genomic library with the selected probe may be conducted using standard procedures such as described in Sambrook et al. New York Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1989 . An alternative means to isolate the gene encoding antibody or polypeptide is to use PCR methodology Sambrook et al. supra Dieffenbach et al. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1995 .

Techniques for screening a cDNA library are well known in the art. The oligonucleotide sequences selected as probes should be of sufficient length and sufficiently unambiguous that false positives are minimized. The oligonucleotide is preferably labeled such that it can be detected upon hybridization to DNA in the library being screened. Methods of labeling are well known in the art and include the use of radiolabels like P labeled ATP biotinylation or enzyme labeling. Hybridization conditions including moderate stringency and high stringency are provided in Sambrook et al. supra.

Sequences identified in such library screening methods can be compared and aligned to other known sequences deposited and available in public databases such as GenBank or other private sequence databases. Sequence identity at either the amino acid or nucleotide level within defined regions of the molecule or across the full length sequence can be determined using methods known in the art and as described herein.

Nucleic acid having protein coding sequence may be obtained by screening selected cDNA or genomic libraries using the deduced amino acid sequence disclosed herein for the first time and if necessary using conventional primer extension procedures as described in Sambrook et al. supra to detect precursors and processing intermediates of mRNA that may not have been reverse transcribed into cDNA.

Host cells are. transfected or transformed with expression or cloning vectors described herein for antibody or polypeptide production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences. The culture conditions such as media temperature pH and the like can be selected by the skilled artisan without undue experimentation. In general principles protocols and practical techniques for maximizing the productivity of cell cultures can be found in M. Butler ed. IRL Press 1991 and Sambrook et al. supra.

Methods of eukaryotic cell transfection and prokaryotic cell transformation are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan for example CaCl CaPO liposome mediated and electroporation. Depending on the host cell used transformation is performed using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride as described in Sambrook et al. supra or electroporation is generally used for prokaryotes. Infection with is used for transformation of certain plant cells as described by Shaw et al. 23 315 1983 and WO 89 05859 published 29 Jun. 1989. For mammalian cells without such cell walls the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Graham and van der Eb 52 456 457 1978 can be employed. General aspects of mammalian cell host system transfections have been described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 399 216. Transformations into yeast are typically carried out according to the method of Van Solingen et al. 130 946 1977 and Hsiao et al. 76 3829 1979 . However other methods for introducing DNA into cells such as by nuclear microinjection electroporation bacterial protoplast fusion with intact cells or polycations e.g. polybrene polyornithine may also be used. For various techniques for transforming mammalian cells see Keown et al. 185 527 537 1990 and Mansour et al. 336 348 352 1988 .

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include prokaryote yeast or higher eukaryote cells. Suitable prokaryotes include but are not limited to eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms for example Enterobacteriaceae such as Various strains are publicly available such as K12 strain MM294 ATCC 31 446 X1776 ATCC 31 537 strain W3110 ATCC 27 325 and K5 772 ATCC 53 635 . Other suitable prokaryotic host cells include Enterobacteriaceae such as e.g. e.g. e.g. and as well as such as and e.g. 41P disclosed in DD 266 710 published 12 Apr. 1989 such as and These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Strain W3110 is one particularly preferred host or parent host because it is a common host strain for recombinant DNA product fermentations. Preferably the host cell secretes minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes. For example strain W3110 may be modified to effect a genetic mutation in the genes encoding proteins endogenous to the host with examples of such hosts including W3110 strain 1A2 which has the complete genotype tonA W3110 strain 9E4 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 W3110 strain 27C7 ATCC 55 244 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 argF lac 169 degP ompT kanW3110 strain 37D6 which has the complete genotype tonA ptr3 phoA E15 argF lac 169 degP ompT rbs7 ilvG kanW3110 strain 40B4 which is strain 37D6 with a non kanamycin resistant degP deletion mutation and an strain having mutant periplasmic protease disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 783 issued 7 Aug. 1990. Alternatively in vitro methods of cloning e.g. PCR or other nucleic acid polymerase reactions are suitable.

Full length antibody antibody fragments and antibody fusion proteins can be produced in bacteria in particular when glycosylation and Fc effector function are not needed such as when the therapeutic antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a toxin and the immunoconjugate by itself shows effectiveness in tumor cell destruction. Full length antibodies have greater half life in circulation. Production in is faster and more cost efficient. For expression of antibody fragments and polypeptides in bacteria see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237 Carter et. al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 789 199 Joly et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5 840 523 Simmons et al. which describes translation initiation regio TIR and signal sequences for optimizing expression and secretion these patents incorporated herein by reference. After expression the antibody is isolated from the cell paste in a soluble fraction and can be purified through e.g. a protein A or G column depending on the isotype. Final purification can be carried out similar to the process for purifying antibody expressed e.g in CHO cells.

In addition to prokaryotes eukaryotic microbes such as filamentous fungi or yeast are suitable cloning or expression hosts for antibody or polypeptide encoding vectors. is a commonly used lower eukaryotic host microorganism. Others include Beach and Nurse 290 140 1981 EP 139 383 published 2 May 1985 U.S. Pat. No. 4 943 529 Fleer et al. 9 968 975 1991 such as e.g. MW98 8C CBS683 CBS4574 Louvencourt et al. 154 2 737 742 1983 ATCC 12 424 ATCC 16 045 ATCC 24 178 ATCC 56 500 ATCC 36 906 Van den Berg et al. 8 135 1990 and EP 402 226 EP 183 070 Sreekrishna et al. 28 265 278 1988 EP 244 234 Case et al. 76 5259 5263 1979 such as EP 394 538 published 31 Oct. 1990 and filamentous fungi such as e.g. WO 91 00357 published 10 Jan. 1991 and hosts such as Ballance et al. 112 284 289 1983 Tilburn et al. 26 205 221 1983 Yelton et al. 81 1470 1474 1984 and Kelly and Hynes 4 475 479 1985 . Methylotropic yeasts are suitable herein and include but are not limited to yeast capable of growth on methanol selected from the genera consisting of and A list of specific species that are exemplary of this class of yeasts may be found in C. Anthony 269 1982 .

Suitable host cells for the expression of glycosylated antibody or polypeptide are derived from multicellular organisms. Examples of invertebrate cells include insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 as well as plant cells such as cell cultures of cotton corn potato soybean petunia tomato and tobacco. Numerous baculoviral strains and variants and corresponding permissive insect host cells from hosts such as caterpillar mosquito mosquito fruitfly and have been identified. A variety of viral strains for transfection are publicly available e.g. the L 1 variant of NPV and the Bm 5 strain of NPV and such viruses may be used as the virus herein according to the present invention particularly for transfection of cells.

However interest has been greatest in vertebrate cells and propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al. 36 59 1977 baby hamster kidney cells BHK ATCC CCL 10 Chinese hamster ovary cells DHFR CHO Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 mouse sertoli cells TM4 Mather 23 243 251 1980 monkey kidney cells CV1 ATCC CCL 70 African green monkey kidney cells VERO 76 ATCC CRL 1587 human cervical carcinoma cells HELA ATCC CCL 2 canine kidney cells MDCK ATCC CCL 34 buffalo rat liver cells BRL 3A ATCC CRL 1442 human lung cells W138 ATCC CCL 75 human liver cells Hep G2 HB 8065 mouse mammary tumor MMT 060562 ATCC CCL51 TRI cells Mather et al. 383 44 68 1982 MRC 5 cells FS4 cells and a human hepatoma line Hep G2 .

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for antibody or polypeptide production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The nucleic acid e.g. cDNA or genomic DNA encoding antibody or polypeptide may be inserted into a replicable vector for cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. Various vectors are publicly available. The vector may for example be in the form of a plasmid cosmid viral particle or phage. The appropriate nucleic acid sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general DNA is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site s using techniques known in the art. Vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence. Construction of suitable vectors containing one or more of these components employs standard ligation techniques which are known to the skilled artisan.

The polypeptide may be produced recombinantly not only directly but also as a fusion polypeptide with a heterologous polypeptide which may be a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the antibody or polypeptide encoding DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence may be a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase lpp or heat stable enterotoxin II leaders. For yeast secretion the signal sequence may be e.g. the yeast invertase leader alpha factor leader including and factor leaders the latter described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 010 182 or acid phosphatase leader the glucoamylase leader EP 362 179 published 4 Apr. 1990 or the signal described in WO 90 13646 published 15 Nov. 1990. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences may be used to direct secretion of the protein such as signal sequences from secreted polypeptides of the same or related species as well as viral secretory leaders.

Both expression and cloning vectors contain a nucleic acid sequence that enables the vector to replicate in one or more selected host cells. Such sequences are well known for a variety of bacteria yeast and viruses. The origin of replication from the plasmid pBR322 is suitable for most Gram negative bacteria the 2 plasmid origin is suitable for yeast and various viral origins SV40 polyoma adenovirus VSV or BPV are useful for cloning vectors in mammalian cells.

Expression and cloning vectors will typically contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media e.g. the gene encoding D alanine racemase for

An example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody or polypeptide encoding nucleic acid such as DHFR or thymidine kinase. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity prepared and propagated as described by Urlaub et al. 77 4216 1980 . A suitable selection gene for use in yeast is the trp1 gene present in the yeast plasmid YRp7 Stinchcomb et al. 282 39 1979 Kingsman et al. 7 141 1979 Tschemper et al. 10 157 1980 . The trp1 gene provides a selection marker for a mutant strain of yeast lacking the ability to grow in tryptophan for example ATCC No. 44076 or PEP4 1 Jones 85 12 1977 .

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter operably linked to the antibody or polypeptide encoding nucleic acid sequence to direct mRNA synthesis. Promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the lactamase and lactose promoter systems Chang et al. 275 615 1978 Goeddel et al. 281 544 1979 alkaline phosphatase a tryptophan trp promoter system Goeddel 8 4057 1980 EP 36 776 and hybrid promoters such as the tac promoter deBoer et al. 80 21 25 1983 . Promoters for use in bacterial systems also will contain a Shine Dalgarno S.D. sequence operably linked to the DNA encoding antibody or polypeptide.

Examples of suitable promoting sequences for use with yeast hosts include the promoters for 3 phosphoglycerate kinase Hitzeman et al. 255 2073 1980 or other glycolytic enzymes Hess et al. 7 149 1968 Holland 17 4900 1978 such as enolase glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase hexokinase pyruvate decarboxylase phosphofructokinase glucose 6 phosphate isomerase 3 phosphoglycerate mutase pyruvate kinase triosephosphate isomerase phosphoglucose isomerase and glucokinase.

Other yeast promoters which are inducible promoters having the additional advantage of transcription controlled by growth conditions are the promoter regions for alcohol dehydrogenase 2 isocytochrome C acid phosphatase degradative enzymes associated with nitrogen metabolism metallothionein glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase and enzymes responsible for maltose and galactose utilization. Suitable vectors and promoters for use in yeast expression are further described in EP 73 657.

Antibody or polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus UK 2 211 504 published 5 Jul. 1989 adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter and from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

Transcription of a DNA encoding the antibody or polypeptide by higher eukaryotes may be increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis acting elements of DNA usually about from 10 to 300 bp that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the antibody or polypeptide coding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells yeast fungi insect plant animal human or nucleated cells from other multicellular organisms will also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding antibody or polypeptide.

Still other methods vectors and host cells suitable for adaptation to the synthesis of antibody or polypeptide in recombinant vertebrate cell culture are described in Gething et al. 293 620 625 1981 Mantei et al. 281 40 46 1979 EP 117 060 and EP 117 058.

The host cells used to produce the antibody or polypeptide of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. Re. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

Gene amplification and or expression may be measured in a sample directly for example by conventional Southern blotting Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA Thomas 77 5201 5205 1980 dot blotting DNA analysis or in situ hybridization using an appropriately labeled probe based on the sequences provided herein. Alternatively antibodies may be employed that can recognize specific duplexes including DNA duplexes RNA duplexes and DNA RNA hybrid duplexes or DNA protein duplexes. The antibodies in turn may be labeled and the assay may be carried out where the duplex is bound to a surface so that upon the formation of duplex on the surface the presence of antibody bound to the duplex can be detected.

Gene expression alternatively may be measured by immunological methods such as immunohistochemical staining of cells or tissue sections and assay of cell culture or body fluids to quantitate directly the expression of gene product. Antibodies useful for immunohistochemical staining and or assay of sample fluids may be either monoclonal or polyclonal and may be prepared in any mammal. Conveniently the antibodies may be prepared against a native sequence polypeptide or against a synthetic peptide based on the DNA sequence provided herein or against exogenous sequence fused to polypeptide DNA and encoding a specific antibody epitope.

Forms of antibody and polypeptide may be recovered from culture medium or from host cell lysates. If membrane bound it can be released from the membrane using a suitable detergent solution e.g. Triton X 100 or by enzymatic cleavage. Cells employed in expression of antibody and polypeptide can be disrupted by various physical or chemical means such as freeze thaw cycling sonication mechanical disruption or cell lysing agents.

It may be desired to purify antibody and polypeptide from recombinant cell proteins or polypeptides. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures by fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75 protein A Sepharose columns to remove contaminants such as IgG and metal chelating columns to bind epitope tagged forms of the antibody and polypeptide. Various methods of protein purification may be employed and such methods are known in the art and described for example in Deutscher 182 1990 Scopes Springer Verlag New York 1982 . The purification step s selected will depend for example on the nature of the production process used and the particular antibody or polypeptide produced.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly in the periplasmic space or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Carter et al. 10 163 167 1992 describe a procedure for isolating antibodies which are secreted to the periplasmic space of Briefly cell paste is thawed in the presence of sodium acetate pH 3.5 EDTA and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride PMSF over about 30 min. Cell debris can be removed by centrifugation. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a C3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

Therapeutic formulations of the antibodies binding oligopeptides binding organic or inorganic small molecules and or polypeptides used in accordance with the present invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody polypeptide oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule having the desired degree of purity with optional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 in the form of lyophilized formulations or aqueous solutions. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as acetate Tris phosphate citrate and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA tonicifiers such as trehalose and sodium chloride sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol surfactant such as polysorbate salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG . The formulation may comprise the antibody at a concentration of between 5 200 mg ml preferably between 10 100 mg ml.

The formulations herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. For example in addition to an antibody binding oligopeptide or binding organic or inorganic small molecule it may be desirable to include in the one formulation an additional antibody e.g. a second antibody which binds a different epitope on the same polypeptide or an antibody to some other target such as a growth factor that affects the growth of the particular cancer. Alternatively or additionally the composition may further comprise a chemotherapeutic agent cytotoxic agent cytokine growth inhibitory agent anti hormonal agent and or cardioprotectant. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsules prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules and poly methylmethacylate microcapsules respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 16th edition Osol A. Ed. 1980 .

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semi permeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the antibody which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsules. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid.

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

To determine polypeptide hepsin and or HGF expression in the cancer various detection assays are available. In one embodiment polypeptide overexpression may be analyzed by immunohistochemistry IHC . Parrafin embedded tissue sections from a tumor biopsy may be subjected to the IHC assay and accorded a polypeptide staining intensity criteria as follows 

Score 1 a faint barely perceptible membrane staining is detected in more than 10 of the tumor cells. The cells are only stained in part of their membrane.

Score 2 a weak to moderate complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Score 3 a moderate to strong complete membrane staining is observed in more than 10 of the tumor cells.

Those tumors with 0 or 1 scores for polypeptide expression may be characterized as not overexpressing the polypeptide whereas those tumors with 2 or 3 scores may be characterized as overexpressing the polypeptide.

Alternatively or additionally FISH assays such as the INFORM sold by Ventana Ariz. or PATHVISION Vysis Ill. may be carried out on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue to determine the extent if any of polypeptide overexpression in the tumor.

Polypeptide overexpression or amplification may be evaluated using an in vivo detection assay e.g. by administering a molecule such as an antibody oligopeptide or organic small molecule which binds the molecule to be detected and is tagged with a detectable label e.g. a radioactive isotope or a fluorescent label and externally scanning the patient for localization of the label.

As described above the antibodies oligopeptides and organic small molecules of the invention have various non therapeutic applications. The antibodies oligopeptides and organic inorganic small molecules of the present invention can be useful for staging of polypeptide expressing cancers e.g. in radioimaging . The antibodies oligopeptides and organic small molecules are also useful for purification or immunoprecipitation of polypeptide from cells for detection and quantitation of polypeptide in vitro e.g. in an ELISA or a Western blot to kill and eliminate polypeptide expressing cells from a population of mixed cells as a step in the purification of other cells.

Currently depending on the stage of the cancer cancer treatment involves one or a combination of the following therapies surgery to remove the cancerous tissue radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Antibody oligopeptide or organic small molecule therapy may be especially desirable in elderly patients who do not tolerate the toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy well and in metastatic disease where radiation therapy has limited usefulness. The tumor targeting antibodies oligopeptides and organic inorganic small molecules of the invention are useful to alleviate polypeptide expressing cancers upon initial diagnosis of the disease or during relapse. For therapeutic applications the antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule can be used alone or in combination therapy with e.g. hormones antiangiogens or radiolabelled compounds or with surgery cryotherapy and or radiotherapy. Antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule treatment can be administered in conjunction with other forms of conventional therapy either consecutively with pre or post conventional therapy. Chemotherapeutic drugs such as TAXOTERE docetaxel TAXOL palictaxel estramustine and mitoxantrone are used in treating cancer in particular in good risk patients. In the present method of the invention for treating or alleviating cancer the cancer patient can be administered antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule in conjunction with treatment with the one or more of the preceding chemotherapeutic agents. In particular combination therapy with palictaxel and modified derivatives see e.g. EP0600517 is contemplated. The antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule will be administered with a therapeutically effective dose of the chemotherapeutic agent. In another embodiment the antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule is administered in conjunction with chemotherapy to enhance the activity and efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent e.g. paclitaxel. The Physicians Desk Reference PDR discloses dosages of these agents that have been used in treatment of various cancers. The dosing regimen and dosages of these aforementioned chemotherapeutic drugs that are therapeutically effective will depend on the particular cancer being treated the extent of the disease and other factors familiar to the physician of skill in the art and can be determined by the physician.

In one particular embodiment a conjugate comprising an antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule conjugated with a cytotoxic agent is administered to the patient. Preferably the immunoconjugate bound to the protein is internalized by the cell resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the cancer cell to which it binds. In a preferred embodiment the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with the nucleic acid in the cancer cell. Examples of such cytotoxic agents are described above and include maytansinoids calicheamicins ribonucleases and DNA endonucleases.

The antibodies oligopeptides organic inorganic small molecules or toxin conjugates thereof are administered to a human patient in accord with known methods such as intravenous administration e.g. as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by intramuscular intraperitoneal intracerobrospinal subcutaneous intra articular intrasynovial intrathecal oral topical or inhalation routes. Intravenous or subcutaneous administration of the antibody oligopeptide or organic small molecule is preferred.

Other therapeutic regimens may be combined with the administration of the antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule. The combined administration includes co administration using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation and consecutive administration in either order wherein preferably there is a time period while both or all active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. Preferably such combined therapy results in a synergistic therapeutic effect.

It may also be desirable to combine administration of the antibody or antibodies oligopeptides or organic inorganic small molecules with administration of an antibody directed against another tumor antigen associated with the particular cancer.

In another embodiment the therapeutic treatment methods of the present invention involves the combined administration of an antibody or antibodies oligopeptides or organic inorganic small molecules and one or more chemotherapeutic agents or growth inhibitory agents including co administration of cocktails of different chemotherapeutic agents. Chemotherapeutic agents include estramustine phosphate prednimustine cisplatin 5 fluorouracil melphalan cyclophosphamide hydroxyurea and hydroxyureataxanes such as paclitaxel and doxetaxel and or anthracycline antibiotics. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapeutic agents may be used according to manufacturers instructions or as determined empirically by the skilled practitioner. Preparation and dosing schedules for such chemotherapy are also described in Chemotherapy Service Ed. M. C. Perry Williams Wilkins Baltimore Md. 1992 .

The antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule may be combined with an anti hormonal compound e.g. an anti estrogen compound such as tamoxifen an anti progesterone such as onapristone see EP 616 812 or an anti androgen such as flutamide in dosages known for such molecules. Where the cancer to be treated is androgen independent cancer the patient may previously have been subjected to anti androgen therapy and after the cancer becomes androgen independent the antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule and optionally other agents as described herein may be administered to the patient.

Sometimes it may be beneficial to also co administer a cardioprotectant to prevent or reduce myocardial dysfunction associated with the therapy or one or more cytokines to the patient. In addition to the above therapeutic regimes the patient may be subjected to surgical removal of cancer cells and or radiation therapy before simultaneously with or post antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule therapy. Suitable dosages for any of the above co administered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the agent and antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the dosage and mode of administration will be chosen by the physician according to known criteria. The appropriate dosage of antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule will depend on the type of disease to be treated as defined above the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the patient s clinical history and response to the antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Preferably the antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule is administered by intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injections. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to about 50 mg kg body weight e.g. about 0.1 15 mg kg dose of antibody can be an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. A dosing regimen can comprise administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. A typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. The progress of this therapy can be readily monitored by conventional methods and assays and based on criteria known to the physician or other persons of skill in the art.

Aside from administration of the antibody protein to the patient the present application contemplates administration of the antibody by gene therapy. Such administration of nucleic acid encoding the antibody is encompassed by the expression administering a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody . See for example WO96 07321 published Mar. 14 1996 concerning the use of gene therapy to generate intracellular antibodies.

There are two major approaches to getting the nucleic acid optionally contained in a vector into the patient s cells in vivo and ex vivo. For in vivo delivery the nucleic acid is injected directly into the patient usually at the site where the antibody is required. For ex vivo treatment the patient s cells are removed the nucleic acid is introduced into these isolated cells and the modified cells are administered to the patient either directly or for example encapsulated within porous membranes which are implanted into the patient see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 892 538 and 5 283 187 . There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes electroporation microinjection cell fusion DEAE dextran the calcium phosphate precipitation method etc. A commonly used vector for ex vivo delivery of the gene is a retroviral vector.

The currently preferred in vivo nucleic acid transfer techniques include transfection with viral vectors such as adenovirus Herpes simplex I virus or adeno associated virus and lipid based systems useful lipids for lipid mediated transfer of the gene are DOTMA DOPE and DC Chol for example . For review of the currently known gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 . See also WO 93 25673 and the references cited therein.

The antibodies of the invention can be in the different forms encompassed by the definition of antibody herein. Thus the antibodies include full length or intact antibody antibody fragments native sequence antibody or amino acid variants humanized chimeric or fusion antibodies immunoconjugates and functional fragments thereof. In fusion antibodies an antibody sequence is fused to a heterologous polypeptide sequence. The antibodies can be modified in the Fc region to provide desired effector functions. As discussed in more detail in the sections herein with the appropriate Fc regions the naked antibody bound on the cell surface can induce cytotoxicity e.g. via antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC or by recruiting complement in complement dependent cytotoxicity or some other mechanism. Alternatively where it is desirable to eliminate or reduce effector function so as to minimize side effects or therapeutic complications certain other Fc regions may be used.

In one embodiment the antibody competes for binding or bind substantially to the same epitope as the antibodies of the invention. Antibodies having the biological characteristics of the present antibodies of the invention are also contemplated specifically including the in vivo tumor targeting and any cell proliferation inhibition or cytotoxic characteristics.

The present antibodies oligopeptides and organic inorganic small molecules are useful for treating a hepsin and or HGF expressing cancer or alleviating one or more symptoms of the cancer in a mammal. Methods of the invention encompass usage of antagonists in the treatment and or alleviation of symptoms of metastatic tumors associated with these cancers. The antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule antagonist is able to bind to at least a portion of the cancer cells that express the polypeptide s hepsin and or HGF in the mammal. In one embodiment the antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule is effective to destroy or kill polypeptide expressing and or responsive tumor cells or inhibit the growth of such tumor cells in vitro or in vivo upon binding to the polypeptide. Such an antibody includes a naked antibody not conjugated to any agent . Naked antibodies that have cytotoxic or cell growth inhibition properties can be further harnessed with a cytotoxic agent to render them even more potent in tumor cell destruction. Cytotoxic properties can be conferred to an antibody by e.g. conjugating the antibody with a cytotoxic agent to form an immunoconjugate as described herein. In some embodiments the cytotoxic agent or a growth inhibitory agent is a small molecule. In some embodiments toxins such as calicheamicin or a maytansinoid and analogs or derivatives thereof are used.

Also provided are methods of inhibiting the growth of and killing a polypeptide hepsin and or HGF expressing and or responsive cell.

The invention also provides kits and articles of manufacture comprising at least one antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule. Kits containing antibodies oligopeptides or organic inorganic small molecules find use e.g. for cell killing assays for purification or immunoprecipitation of polypeptide from cells. For example for isolation and purification of a polypeptide the kit can contain an antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule coupled to beads e.g. sepharose beads . Kits can be provided which contain the antibodies oligopeptides or organic inorganic small molecules for detection and quantitation of a polypeptide in vitro e.g. in an ELISA or a Western blot.

Suitable containers include for example bottles vials syringes etc. The containers may be formed from a variety of materials such as glass or plastic. The container holds a composition which is effective for treating the cancer condition and may have a sterile access port for example the container may be an intravenous solution bag or a vial having a stopper pierceable by a hypodermic injection needle . At least one active agent in the composition is an antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule of the invention. The label or package insert indicates that the composition is used for treating cancer. The label or package insert will further comprise instructions for administering the antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule composition to the cancer patient. Additionally the article of manufacture may further comprise a second container comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer such as bacteriostatic water for injection BWFI phosphate buffered saline Ringer s solution and dextrose solution. It may further include other materials desirable from a commercial and user standpoint including other buffers diluents filters needles and syringes.

Kits are also provided that are useful for various purposes e.g. for polypeptide expressing or cell killing assays for purification or immunoprecipitation of a polypeptide from cells. For isolation and purification of a polypeptide the kit can contain an antibody oligopeptide or organic inorganic small molecule coupled to beads e.g. sepharose beads . Kits can be provided which contain the antibodies oligopeptides or organic inorganic small molecules for detection and quantitation of a polypeptide in vitro e.g. in an ELISA or a Western blot.

Additional containers may be included that contain e.g. diluents and buffers control antibodies. The label or package insert may provide a description of the composition as well as instructions for the intended in vitro or detection use.

Nucleotide sequences or their complement encoding polypeptides of the invention have various applications in the art of molecular biology as well as uses for therapy etc. Polypeptide encoding nucleic acid will also be useful for the preparation of polypeptides by the recombinant techniques described herein wherein those polypeptides may find use for example in the preparation of antibodies as described herein.

A full length native sequence polypeptide gene or portions thereof may be used as hybridization probes for a cDNA library to isolate other cDNAs for instance those encoding naturally occurring variants of a polypeptide or a polypeptide from other species which have a desired sequence identity to a native polypeptide sequence disclosed herein. Optionally the length of the probes will be about 20 to about 50 bases. The hybridization probes may be derived from at least partially novel regions of the full length native nucleotide sequence wherein those regions may be determined without undue experimentation or from genomic sequences including promoters enhancer elements and introns of native sequence polypeptide. By way of example a screening method will comprise isolating the coding region of the polypeptide gene using the known DNA sequence to synthesize a selected probe of about 40 bases. Hybridization probes may be labeled by a variety of labels including radionucleotides such as P or S or enzymatic labels such as alkaline phosphatase coupled to the probe via avidinfbiotin coupling systems. Labeled probes having a sequence complementary to that of the polypeptide gene of the present invention can be used to screen libraries of human cDNA genomic DNA or mRNA to determine which members of such libraries the probe hybridizes to. Hybridization techniques are described in further detail in the Examples below. Any EST sequences disclosed in the present application may similarly be employed as probes using the methods disclosed herein.

Other useful fragments of the polypeptide encoding nucleic acids include antisense or sense oligonucleotides comprising a singe stranded nucleic acid sequence either RNA or DNA capable of binding to target a polypeptide mRNA sense or a polypeptide DNA antisense sequence. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides according to the present invention comprise a fragment of the coding region of a DNA encoding hepsin pro HGF or binding fragments as described herein. Such a fragment generally comprises at least about 14 nucleotides preferably from about 14 to 30 nucleotides. The ability to derive an antisense or a sense oligonucleotide based upon a cDNA sequence encoding a given protein is described in for example Stein and Cohen 48 2659 1988 and van der Krol et al. 6 958 1988 .

Binding of antisense or sense oligonucleotides to target nucleic acid sequences results in the formation of duplexes that block transcription or translation of the target sequence by one of several means including enhanced degradation of the duplexes premature termination of transcription or translation or by other means. Such methods are encompassed by the present invention. The antisense oligonucleotides thus may be used to block expression of a protein wherein the protein may play a role in the induction of cancer in mammals. Antisense or sense oligonucleotides further comprise oligonucleotides having modified sugar phosphodiester backbones or other sugar linkages such as those described in WO 91 06629 and wherein such sugar linkages are resistant to endogenous nucleases. Such oligonucleotides with resistant sugar linkages are stable in vivo i.e. capable of resisting enzymatic degradation but retain sequence specificity to be able to bind to target nucleotide sequences.

Preferred intragenic sites for antisense binding include the region incorporating the translation initiation start codon 5 AUG 5 ATG or termination stop codon 5 UAA 5 UAG and 5 UGA 5 TAA 5 TAG and 5 TGA of the open reading frame ORF of the gene. These regions refer to a portion of the mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction i.e. 5 or 3 from a translation initiation or termination codon. Other preferred regions for antisense binding include introns exons intron exon junctions the open reading frame ORF or coding region which is the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon the 5 cap of an mRNA which comprises an N7 methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5 most residue of the mRNA via a 5 5 triphosphate linkage and includes 5 cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the cap the 5 untranslated region 5 UTR the portion of an mRNA in the 5 direction from the translation initiation codon and thus including nucleotides between the 5 cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene and the 3 untranslated region 3 UTR the portion of an mRNA in the 3 direction from the translation termination codon and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3 end of an mRNA or corresponding nucleotides on the gene.

Specific examples of preferred antisense compounds useful for inhibiting expression of a polypeptide include oligonucleotides containing modified backbones or non natural intemucleoside linkages. Oligonucleotides having modified backbones include those that retain a phosphorus atom in the backbone and those that do not have a phosphorus atom in the backbone. For the purposes of this specification and as sometimes referenced in the art modified oligonucleotides that do not have a phosphorus atom in their internucleoside backbone can also be considered to be oligonucleosides. Preferred modified oligonucleotide backbones include for example phosphorothioates chiral phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates phosphotriesters aminoalkylphosphotri esters methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3 alkylene phosphonates 5 alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates phosphinates phosphoramidates including 3 amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates thionophosphoramidates thionoalkylphosphonates thionoalkylphosphotriesters selenophosphates and borano phosphates having normal 3 5 linkages 2 5 linked analogs of these and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3 to 3 5 to 5 or 2 to 2 linkage. Preferred oligonucleotides having inverted polarity comprise a single 3 to 3 linkage at the 3 most internucleotide linkage i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic the nucleobase is missing or has a hydroxyl group in place thereof .

It is not necessary for all positions in a given compound to be uniformly modified and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single compound or even at a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide. The present invention also includes antisense compounds which are chimeric compounds. Chimeric antisense compounds or chimeras in the context of this invention are antisense compounds particularly oligonucleotides which contain two or more chemically distinct regions each made up of at least one monomer unit i.e. a nucleotide in the case of an oligonucleotide compound. These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region wherein the oligonucleotide is modified so as to confer upon the oligonucleotide increased resistance to nuclease degradation increased cellular uptake and or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. An additional region of the oligonucleotide may serve as a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA DNA or RNA RNA hybrids. By way of example RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA DNA duplex. Activation of RNase H therefore results in cleavage of the RNA target thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of oligonucleotide inhibition of gene expression. Consequently comparable results can often be obtained with shorter oligonucleotides when chimeric oligonucleotides are used compared to phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides hybridizing to the same target region. Chimeric antisense compounds of the invention may be formed as composite strucnticres of two or more oligonucleotides modified oligonucleotides oligonucleosides and or oligonucleotide mimetics as described above. Preferred chimeric antisense oligonucleotides incorporate at least one 2 modified sugar preferably 2 O CH O CH at the 3 terminal to confer nuclease resistance and a region with at least 4 contiguous 2 H sugars to confer RNase H activity. Such compounds have also been referred to in the art as hybrids or gapmers. Preferred gapmers have a region of 2 modified sugars preferably 2 O CH O CH at the 3 terminal and at the 5 terminal separated by at least one region having at least 4 contiguous 2 H sugars and preferably incorporate phosphorothioate backbone linkages. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such hybrid structures include but are not limited to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 013 830 5 149 797 5 220 007 5 256 775 5 366 878 5 403 711 5 491 133 5 565 350 5 623 065 5 652 355 5 652 356 and 5 700 922 each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The antisense compounds used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well known technique of solid phase synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including for example Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. . Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. It is well known to use similar techniques to prepare oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives. The compounds of the invention may also be admixed encapsulated conjugated or otherwise associated with other molecules molecule structures or mixtures of compounds as for example liposomes receptor targeted molecules oral rectal topical or other formulations for assisting in uptake distribution and or absorption. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such uptake distribution and or absorption assisting formulations include but are not limited to U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 108 921 5 354 844 5 416 016 5 459 127 5 521 291 5 543 158 5 547 932 5 583 020 5 591 721 4 426 330 4 534 899 5 013 556 5 108 921 5 213 804 5 227 170 5 264 221 5 356 633 5 395 619 5 416 016 5 417 978 5 462 854 5 469 854 5 512 295 5 527 528 5 534 259 5 543 152 5 556 948 5 580 575 and 5 595 756 each of which is herein incorporated by reference.

Other examples of sense or antisense oligonucleotides include those oligonucleotides which are covalently linked to organic moieties such as those described in WO 90 10048 and other moieties that increases affinity of the oligonucleotide for a target nucleic acid sequence such as poly L lysine . Further still intercalating agents such as ellipticine and alkylating agents or metal complexes may be attached to sense or antisense oligonucleotides to modify binding specificities of the antisense or sense oligonucleotide for the target nucleotide sequence.

Antisense or sense oligonucleotides may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by any gene transfer method including for example CaPO mediated DNA transfection electroporation or by using gene transfer vectors such as Epstein Barr virus. In a preferred procedure an antisense or sense oligonucleotide is inserted into a suitable retroviral vector. A cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence is contacted with the recombinant retroviral vector either in vivo or ex vivo. Suitable retroviral vectors include but are not limited to those derived from the murine retrovirus M MuLV N2 a retrovirus derived from M MuLV or the double copy vectors designated DCT5A DCT5B and DCT5C see WO 90 13641 .

Sense or antisense oligonucleotides also may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleotide sequence by formation of a conjugate with a ligand binding molecule as described in WO 91 04753. Suitable ligand binding molecules include but are not limited to cell surface receptors growth factors other cytokines or other ligands that bind to cell surface receptors. Preferably conjugation of the ligand binding molecule does not substantially interfere with the ability of the ligand binding molecule to bind to its corresponding molecule or receptor or block entry of the sense or antisense oligonucleotide or its conjugated version into the cell.

Alternatively a sense or an antisense oligonucleotide may be introduced into a cell containing the target nucleic acid sequence by formation of an oligonucleotide lipid complex as described in WO 90 10448. The sense or antisense oligonucleotide lipid complex is preferably dissociated within the cell by an endogenous lipase.

Antisense or sense RNA or DNA molecules are generally at least about 5 nucleotides in length alternatively at least about 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200 210 220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320 330 340 350 360 370 380 390 400 410 420 430 440 450 460 470 480 490 500 510 520 530 540 550 560 570 580 590 600 610 620 630 640 650 660 670 680 690 700 710 720 730 740 750 760 770 780 790 800 810 820 830 840 850 860 870 880 890 900 910 920 930 940 950 960 970 980 990 or 1000 nucleotides in length wherein in this context the term about means the referenced nucleotide sequence length plus or minus 10 of that referenced length.

The probes may also be employed in PCR techniques to generate a pool of sequences for identification of closely related polypeptide coding sequences.

Nucleotide sequences encoding a polypeptide can also be used to construct hybridization probes for mapping the gene which encodes that polypeptide and for the genetic analysis of individuals with genetic disorders. The nucleotide sequences provided herein may be mapped to a chromosome and specific regions of a chromosome using known techniques such as in situ hybridization linkage analysis against known chromosomal markers and hybridization screening with libraries.

The polypeptide can be used in assays to identify other proteins or molecules involved in a binding interaction with the polypeptide. By such methods inhibitors of the receptor ligand binding interaction can be identified. Proteins involved in such binding interactions can also be used to screen for peptide or small molecule inhibitors of the binding interaction. Screening assays can be designed to find lead compounds that mimic the biological activity of a native polypeptide or a receptor for the polypeptide. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high throughput screening of chemical libraries making them particularly suitable for identifyjing small molecule drug candidates. Small molecules contemplated include synthetic organic or inorganic compounds. The assays can be performed in a variety of formats including protein protein binding assays biochemical screening assays immunoassays and cell based assays which are well characterized in the art.

Nucleic acids which encode a polypeptide or its modified forms can also be used to generate either transgenic animals or knock out animals which in turn are useful in the development and screening of therapeutically useful reagents. A transgenic animal e.g. a mouse or rat is an animal having cells that contain a transgene which transgene was introduced into the animal or an ancestor of the animal at a prenatal e.g. an embryonic stage. A transgene is a DNA which is integrated into the genome of a cell from which a transgenic animal develops. In one embodiment cDNA encoding a polypeptide can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding the polypeptide in accordance with established techniques and the genomic sequences used to generate transgenic animals that contain cells which express DNA encoding the polypeptide. Methods for generating transgenic animals particularly animals such as mice or rats have become conventional in the art and are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 736 866 and 4 870 009. Typically particular cells would be targeted for polypeptide transgene incorporation with tissue specific enhancers. Transgenic animals that include a copy of a transgene encoding a polypeptide introduced into the germ line of the animal at an embryonic stage can be used to examine the effect of increased expression of DNA encoding a polypeptide. Such animals can be used as tester animals for reagents thought to confer protection from for example pathological conditions associated with its overexpression. In accordance with this facet of the invention an animal is treated with the reagent and a reduced incidence of the pathological condition compared to untreated animals bearing the transgene would indicate a potential therapeutic intervention for the pathological condition.

Alternatively non human homologues of a polypeptide can be used to construct a gene knock out animal which has a defective or altered gene encoding the polypeptide as a result of homologous recombination between the endogenous gene encoding the polypeptide and altered genomic DNA encoding the polypeptide introduced into an embryonic stem cell of the animal. For example cDNA encoding the polypeptide can be used to clone genomic DNA encoding the polypeptide in accordance with established techniques. A portion of the cenomic DNA encoding the polypeptide can be deleted or replaced with another gene such as a gene encoding a selectable marker which can be used to monitor integration. Typically several kilobases of unaltered flanking DNA both at the 5 and 3 ends are included in the vector see e.g. Thomas and Capecchi 51 503 1987 for a description of homologous recombination vectors . The vector is introduced into an embryonic stem cell line e.g. by electroporation and cells in which the introduced DNA has homologously recombined with the endogenous DNA are selected see e.g. Li et al. 69 915 1992 . The selected cells are then injected into a blastocyst of an animal e.g. a mouse or rat to form aggregation chimeras see e.g. Bradley in E. J. Robertson ed. IRL Oxford 1987 pp. 113 152 . A chimeric embryo can then be implanted into a suitable pseudopregnant female foster animal and the embryo brought to term to create a knock out animal. Progeny harboring the homologously recombined DNA in their germ cells can be identified by standard techniques and used to breed animals in which all cells of the animal contain the homologously recombined DNA. Knockout animals can be characterized for instance for their ability to defend against certain pathological conditions and for their development of pathological conditions due to absence of the polypeptide.

Nucleic acid encoding the polypeptides may also be used in gene therapy. In gene therapy applications genes are introduced into cells in order to achieve in vivo synthesis of a therapeutically effective genetic product for example for replacement of a defective gene. Gene therapy includes both conventional gene therapy where a lasting effect is achieved by a single treatment and the administration of gene therapeutic agents which involves the one time or repeated administration of a therapeutically effective DNA or mRNA. Antisense RNAs and DNAs can be used as therapeutic agents for blocking the expression of certain genes in vivo. It has already been shown that short antisense oligonucleotides can be imported into cells where they act as inhibitors despite their low intracellular concentrations caused by their restricted uptake by the cell membrane. Zamecnik et al. 83 4143 4146 1986 . The oligonucleotides can be modified to enhance their uptake e.g. by substituting their negatively charged phosphodiester groups by uncharged groups.

There are a variety of techniques available for introducing nucleic acids into viable cells. The techniques vary depending upon whether the nucleic acid is transferred into cultured cells in vitro or in vivo in the cells of the intended host. Techniques suitable for the transfer of nucleic acid into mammalian cells in vitro include the use of liposomes electroporation microinjection cell fusion DEAE dextran the calcium phosphate precipitation method etc. The currently preferred in vivo gene transfer techniques include transfection with viral typically retroviral vectors and viral coat protein liposome mediated transfection Dzau et al. 11 205 210 1993 . In some situations it is desirable to provide the nucleic acid source with an agent that targets the target cells such as an antibody specific for a cell surface membrane protein or the target cell a ligand for a receptor on the target cell etc. Where liposomes are employed proteins which bind to a cell surface membrane protein associated with endocytosis may be used for targeting and or to facilitate uptake e.g. capsid proteins or fragments thereof tropic for a particular cell type antibodies for proteins which undergo internalization in cycling proteins that target intracellular localization and enhance intracellular half life. The technique of receptor mediated endocytosis is described for example by Wu et al. 262 4429 4432 1987 and Wagner et al. 87 3410 3414 1990 . For review of gene marking and gene therapy protocols see Anderson et al. 256 808 813 1992 .

The nucleic acid molecules encoding the polypeptides or fragments thereof described herein are useful for chromosome identification. In this regard there exists an ongoing need to identify new chromosome. markers since relatively few chromosome marking reagents based upon actual sequence data are presently available. Each nucleic acid molecule of the present invention can be used as a chromosome marker.

Polypeptides and nucleic acid molecules of the invention may be used diagnostically for tissue typing wherein the polypeptides may be differentially expressed in one tissue as compared to another preferably in a diseased tissue as compared to a normal tissue of the same tissue type. Nucleic acid molecules will find use for generating probes for PCR Northern analysis Southern analysis and Western analysis.

This invention encompasses methods of screening compounds to identify those that prevent the effect of the polypeptide antagonists . Screening assays for antagonist drug candidates are designed to identify compounds that bind or complex with the polypeptides encoded by the genes identified herein or otherwise interfere with the interaction of the encoded polypeptides with other cellular proteins including e.g. inhibiting the expression of the polypeptide from cells. Such screening assays will include assays amenable to high throughput screening of chemical libraries making them particularly suitable for identifying small molecule drug candidates.

The assays can be performed in a variety of formats including protein protein binding assays biochemical screening assays immunoassays and cell based assays which are well characterized in the art.

All assays for antagonists are common in that they call for contacting the drug candidate with a polypeptide encoded by a nucleic acid identified herein under conditions and for a time sufficient to allow these two components to interact.

In binding assays the interaction is binding and the complex formed can be isolated or detected in the reaction mixture. In a particular embodiment the polypeptide or the drug candidate is immobilized on a solid phase e.g. on a microtiter plate by covalent or non covalent attachments. Non covaient attachment gencrally is accomplished by coating the solid surface with a solution of the polypeptide and drying. Alternatively an immobilized antibody e.g. a monoclonal antibody specific for the polypeptide to be immobilized can be used to anchor it to a solid surface. The assay is performed by adding the non immobilized component which may be labeled by a detectable label to the immobilized component e.g. the coated surface containing the anchored component. When the reaction is complete the non reacted components are removed e.g. by washing and complexes anchored on the solid surface are detected. When the originally non immobilized component carries a detectable label the detection of label immobilized on the surface indicates that complexing occurred. Where the originally non immobilized component does not carry a label complexing can be detected for example by using a labeled antibody specifically binding the immobilized complex.

If the candidate compound interacts with but does not bind to a polypeptide its interaction with that polypeptide can be assayed by methods well known for detecting protein protein interactions. Such assays include traditional approaches such as e.g. cross linking co immunoprecipitation and co purification through gradients or chromatographic columns. In addition protein protein interactions can be monitored by using a yeast based genetic system described by Fields and co workers Fields and Song 340 245 246 1989 Chien et al. 88 9578 9582 1991 as disclosed by Chevray and Nathans 89 5789 5793 1991 . Many transcriptional activators such as yeast GAL4 consist of two physically discrete modular domains one acting as the DNA binding domain the other one functioning as the transcription activation domain. The yeast expression system described in the foregoing publications generally referred to as the two hybrid system takes advantage of this property and employs two hybrid proteins one in which the target protein is fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and another in which candidate activating proteins are fused to the activation domain. The expression of a GAL1 lacZ reporter gene under control of a GAL4 activated promoter depends on reconstitution of GAL4 activity via protein protein interaction. Colonies containing interacting polypeptides are detected with a chromogenic substrate for galactosidase. A complete kit MATCHMAKER for identifying protein protein interactions between two specific proteins using the two hybrid technique is commercially available from Clontech. This system can also be extended to map protein domains involved in specific protein interactions as well as to pinpoint amino acid residues that are crucial for these interactions.

Compounds that interfere with the interaction of a gene encoding a polypeptide identified herein and other intra or extracellular components can be tested as follows usually a reaction mixture is prepared containing the product of the gene and the intra or extracellular component under conditions and for a time allowing for the interaction and binding of the two products. To test the ability of a candidate compound to inhibit binding the reaction is run in the absence and in the presence of the test compound. In addition a placebo may he added to a third reaction mixture to serve as positive control. The binding complex formation between the test compound and the intra or extracellular component present in the mixture is monitored as described hereinabove. The formation of a complex in the control reaction s but not in the reaction mixture containing the test compound indicates that the test compound interferes with the interaction of the test compound and its reaction partner.

To assay for antagonists the polypeptide may be added to a cell along with the compound to be screened for a particular activity and the ability of the compound to inhibit the activity of interest in the presence of the polypeptide indicates that the compound is an antagonist to the polypeptide. Alternatively antagonists may be detected by combining the polypeptide and a potential antagonist with membrane bound polypeptide receptors or encoded receptors under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. The polypeptide can be labeled such as by radioactivity such that the number of polypeptide molecules bound to the receptor can be used to determine the effectiveness of the potential antagonist. The gene encoding the receptor can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art for example ligand panning and FACS sorting. Coligan et al. 1 2 Chapter 5 1991 . Preferably expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to the polypeptide and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to the polypeptide. Transfected cells that are grown on glass slides are exposed to labeled polypeptide. The polypeptide can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site specific protein kinase. Following fixation and incubation the slides are subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub pools are prepared and re transfected using an interactive sub pooling and re screening process eventually yielding a single clone that encodes the putative receptor.

As an alternative approach for receptor identification labeled polypeptide can be photoaffinity linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross linked material is resolved by PAGE and exposed to X ray film. The labeled complex containing the receptor can be excised resolved into peptide fragments and subjected to protein micro sequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from micro sequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the gene encoding the putative receptor.

In another assay for antagonists mammalian cells or a membrane preparation expressing the receptor would be incubated with labeled polypeptide in the presence of the candidate compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured.

Miore specific examples of potentia 1 antagonists include an oligonucleotide that binds to the fusions of immunoglobulin with a polypeptide and in particular antibodies including without limitation poly and monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments single chain antibodies anti idiotypic antibodies and chimeric or humanized versions of such antibodies or fragments as well as human antibodies and antibody fragments. Alternatively a potential antagonist may be a closely related protein for example a mutated form of the polypeptide that recognizes the receptor but imparts no effect thereby competitively inhibiting the action of the polypeptide.

Another potential antagonist is an antisense RNA or DNA construct prepared using antisense technology where e.g. an antisense RNA or DNA molecule acts to block directly the translation of mRNA by hybridizing to targeted mRNA and preventing protein translation. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA both of which methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example the 5 coding portion of the polynucleotide sequence which encodes the mature polypeptides herein can be used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription triple helix see Lee et al. 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. 241 456 1988 Dervan et al. 251 1360 1991 thereby preventing transcription and the production of the polypeptide. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into the polypeptide antisense Okano 56 560 1991 CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of the polypeptide. When antisense DNA is used oligodeoxyribonucleotides derived from the translation initiation site e.g. between about 10 and 10 positions of the target gene nucleotide sequence are preferred.

Potential antagonists include small molecules that bind to the active site the receptor binding site or growth factor or other relevant binding site of the polypeptide thereby blocking the normal biological activity of the polypeptide. Examples of small molecules include but are not limited to small peptides or peptide like molecules preferably soluble peptides and synthetic non peptidyl organic or inorganic compounds.

Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the specific cleavage of RNA. Ribozymes act by sequence specific hybridization to the complementary target RNA followed by endonucleolytic cleavage. Specific ribozyme cleavage sites within a potential RNA target can be identified by known techniques. For further details see e.g. Rossi 4 469 471 1994 and PCT publication No. WO 97 33551 published Sep. 18 1997 .

Nucleic acid molecules in triple helix formation used to inhibit transcription should be single stranded and composcd of deoxynucleotides. The base composition of these oligonucleotides is designed such that it promotes triple helix formation via Hoogsteen base pairing rules which generally require sizeable stretches of purines or pyrimidines on one strand of a duplex. For further details see e.g. PCT publication No. WO 97 33551 supra.

These small molecules can be identified by any one or more of the screening assays discussed hereinabove and or by any other screening techniques well known for those skilled in the art.

Isolated polypeptide encoding nucleic acid can be used for recombinantly producing polypeptide using techniques well known in the art and as described herein. In turn the produced polypeptides can be employed for generating antibodies using techniques well known in the art and as described herein.

Antibodies specifically binding a polypeptide identified herein as well as other molecules identified by the screening assays disclosed hereinbefore can be administered for the treatment of various disorders including cancer in the form of pharmaceutical compositions.

If the polypeptide is intracellular and whole antibodies are used as inhibitors internalizing antibodies are preferred. However lipofections or liposomes can also be used to deliver the antibody or an antibody fragment into cells. Where antibody fragments are used the smallest inhibitory fragment that specifically binds to the binding domain of the target protein is preferred. For example based upon the variable region sequences of an antibody peptide molecules can be designed that retain the ability to bind the target protein sequence. Such peptides can be synthesized chemically and or produced by recombinant DNA technology. See e.g. Marasco et al. 90 7889 7893 1993 .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Alternatively or in addition the composition may comprise an agent that enhances its function such as for example a cytotoxic agent cytokine chemotherapeutic agent or growth inhibitory agent. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

A soluble form of hepsin encompassing the entire extracellular domain Arg45 Leu417 numbering system in accordance with Somoza et al. 2003 5 and a C terminal Histag was expressed in CHO cells. During the purification process hepsin zymogen spontaneously converted into its two chain form most likely due to an auto activation 4 . N terminal sequencing of the 30 kDa protease domain IVGGRDTSLGR confirmed cleavage at the expected Arg162 Ile163 peptide bond rendering the active enzyme. Hepsin actively converted FVII zymogen into two chain FVIIa consistent with experiments reported by Kazama et al. 1995 9 using cell surface expressed hepsin to determine FVII activation. Hepsin activity towards pro HGF was examined by measuring the conversion of I labelled pro HGF into two chain HGF. The results showed that pro HGF was cleaved by hepsin in a concentration dependent fashion . Hepsin activity was comparable to that of HGFA both enzymes achieving complete conversion of pro HGF at a concentration of 4 13 nM. In the same assay system the pro HGF activators factor XIa factor XIIa and plasma kallikrein require about 5 6 fold higher concentrations for complete pro HGF conversion 45 . N terminal sequencing of the 36k Da and 39 kDa HGF chains gave identical sequences VVNGIPTRTNIG showing that hepsin processed pro HGF at the expected Arg494 Val495 peptide bond. Unlike factor XIa and plasma kallikrein hepsin did not produce the HGF 2 chain fragment by cleavage between Arg424 His425 45 even after prolonged reaction periods. Moreover hepsin 40 nM completely lacked the ability to activate plasminogen during a 5 h reaction . In comparison t PA efficiently processed plasminogen with about 50 of zymogen already cleaved after 0.5 h .

Unlabelled pro HGF 0.3 mg ml was completely converted 95 into HGF with 40 nM hepsin or with 40 nM HGFA to give HGFand HGF respectively. In a kinase receptor assay KIRA with A549 lung carcinoma cells both HGF preparations induced similar concentration dependent increases in Met phosphorylation reaching maximal activity at 250 ng ml . As shown previously 44 an uncleavable single chain form of HGF scHGF with a changed cleavage site R494E had no activity . Control experiments showed that hepsin or HGFA alone had no effect data not shown . Furthermore HGFefficiently promoted proliferation of BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells. The activity was comparable to that of HGFin the examined range of 5 100 ng ml . Similar results were obtained in a cell migration assay with MDA MB435 cells using a collagen coated transwell migration system. As found in cell proliferation assays the pro migratory effects of HGFwere concentration dependent and indistinguishable from the activity of HGF .

An initial screen of 26 commercially available chromogenic substrates showed that S2366 a substrate reported by Somoza et al. 2003 5 was hydrolyzed by hepsin at the highest rate data not shown . Using S2366 as a substrate the inhibitory activities of highly purified soluble forms of wildtype HAI 1B sHAI 1B and HAI 2 sHAI 2 were measured. In addition we produced the two sHAI 1B mutants sHAI 1B R260A and sHAI 1B K401A in which the individual Kunitz domains were inactivated by replacing the Presidues Arg260 in KD1 and Lys401 in KD2 with alanine 34 . The results showed that both sHAI 1B and sHAI 2 potently inhibited hepsin enzymatic activity with ICvalues of 21.1 2.7 nM and 1.3 0.3 nM respectively . Moreover mutant sHAI 1B K401A containing a non functional KD2 was equally potent as wildtype sHAI 1B whereas sHAI 1B R260A had 47 fold reduced activity . The obtained ICvalues are summarized in Table 1.

The ability of sHAI 1B and sHAI 2 to interfere with macromolecular substrate processing was measured in a I pro HGF activation assay. The results obtained were in full agreement with their inhibitory activities determined in amidolytic assays. At concentrations of 1 M sHAI 2 wildtype sHAI 1B and sHAI 1B K401A there was complete inhibition of pro HGF cleavage . In contrast 1 M sHAI 1B R260A showed no inhibition and pro HGF activation proceeded to complete conversion .

The HGF Met signaling pathway plays an important role in human physiology and pathology including tumor invasion and metastasis. The local availability of active HGF is controlled by chymotrypsin like serine proteases and their cognate inhibitors which regulate processing of inactive pro HGF in the extracellular environment. Therefore perturbations of this upstream pro HGF convertase pathway in cancer may promote tumor growth by accelerating pro HGF processing. Here we demonstrate that hepsin a serine protease highly upregulated in prostate and ovarian cancer is a potent activator of pro HGF. Thus hepsin likely plays an important role in effecting tumor growth by activatinig the HGF Met signaling pathway which has been implicated in prostate 46 48 as well as ovarian cancer 49 50 .

Hepsin proteolytically cleaved pro HGF at the Arg494 Val495 peptide bond without any additional cleavage at Arg424 His425 in Kringle domain 4 a site recognized by factor XIa and plasma kallikrein 45 . The two chain HGF generated by hepsin was fully functional inducing Met receptor phosphorylation and promoting cell proliferation and migration with activities comparable to HGF generated by HGFA. The molecular mechanism underlying the hepsin mediated conversion of inactive pro HGF into an active growth factor has similarity to the proteolytic zymogen to enzyme conversion of chymotrypsin like serine proteases. This is supported by recent studies on the structural consequences of pro HGF activation demonstrating that cleavage at Arg494 Val495 leads to conformational changes in the protease like HGF chain and the full maturation of a Met receptor binding site 44 51 . This Met binding site which is centered on the active site region and activation domain of HGF bears remarkable resemblance to the substrate processing region of serine proteases 44 51 . Thus pro HGF cleavage by hepsin effects structural rearrangements on HGF that allow the formation of productive HGF Met signaling complexes. The proteolytic activity of hepsin towards pro HGF appears highly specific since it did not cleave plasminogen the closest structural homolog of pro HGF. Hepsin had no proteolytic activity towards other serine protease substrates such as prothrombin protein C factor X and factor IX 9 .

Studies with HGF null mice show that the HGF Met pathway is essential for normal embryonic development and survival 52 53 . In contrast mice deficient in the hepsin gene develop normally indicating that hepsin is unlikely the main HGF activator during embryogenesis. Similar to hepsin deficiencies of the other known pro HGF convertases matriptase 54 factor XI 55 prekallikrein 56 and u PA 57 are not embryonic lethal. Because of its importance in embryogenesis and post natal physiology HGF activity may be regulated in a concerted manner by multiple pro HGF convertase systems. If so combined pro HGF convertase gene deficiencies should result in developmental defects similar to HGF null mice. Alternatively the pro HGF convertase regulating HGF processing during embryogenesis may not yet have been identified.

HAI 1B HAI 1 and HAI 2 are epithelial cell surface inhibitors and are expressed in many normal tissues and in tumors 34 58 63 . As such they are ideally located to regulate the enzymatic activity of epithelial cell expressed TTSPs and possibly other cell surface associated serine proteases. Indeed the HAI 1 splice variants HAI 1 and HAI 1B potently inhibit the TTSP matriptase MT SP1 and complexes of HAI 1 with matriptase have been found in human breast milk 38 . Here we demonstrate that both sHAI 1B and sHAI 2 are also potent inhibitors of hepsin enzymatic activity. Moreover Presidue directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that inhibition of hepsin is entirely mediated by KD1 of sHAI B since the mutant sHAI 1B R260A was inactive in pro HGF assays and had 

The functional association of hepsin with HAI 1B and HAI 2 in vitro together with their localization to epithelial cell surfaces in vivo suggests that they may constitute a physiologically relevant enzyme inhibitor system. For example the two HAI 1 splice variants and HAI 2 are expressed in normal prostate and prostate cancer cell lines 34 59 61 and HAI 1 antigen was localized to the secretory cell layer of prostate glandular epithelium 59 . Intriguingly hepsin expression in prostate tumors was localized to the same epithelial compartment 19 20 supporting the idea that HAI 1 and possibly HAI 2 associate with hepsin in vivo. While hepsin expression is strongly upregulated in prostate cancer 17 22 HAI 1 and HAI 2 increase only slightly about 1.5 fold according to gene expression results reported by Welsh et al. 2001 17 . As a consequence hepsin enzymatic activity in tumors may be inadequately controlled and could lead to enhanced pro HGF processing and tumor progression. Similar imbalances of pro HGF convertase inhibitor systems have been described for matriptase HAI 1 in ovarian cancer 62 63 HGFA HAI 1 in colorectal cancer 66 67 and HGFA HAI 1 in renal cell carcinoma 68 . The upregulated expression of hepsin in some of these cancers suggests that certain convertase inhibitor systems comprise multiple enzymes and therefore increased enzyme inhibitor ratios could magnify the consequences for malignancy.

In conclusion the results presented show that hepsin efficiently activates pro HGF thus revealing a functional link between hepsin on the tumor epithelial surface and the extracellular matrix containing inactive growth factor precursor. The finding that HAI 1B and HAI 2 are potent inhibitors of hepsin which is upregulated in prostate and ovarian cancer provides new approaches for cancer treatment. For example the functional Kunitz domains of HAI 1B or HAI 2 could serve as scaffolds for generating more specific and or more potent enzyme inhibitors by use of phage display technology which has been successfully applied to other Kunitz domain scaffolds 69 70 .
