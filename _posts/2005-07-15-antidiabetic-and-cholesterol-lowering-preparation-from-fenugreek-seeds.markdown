This application claims the benefit of priority from co pending U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60 282 272 filed Apr. 5 2001. This invention relates to natural compositions having biologically useful activities and more particularly to a composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity obtained from Fenugreek seed.

Hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia are major health concerns. Hyperglycemia can be due to diabetes of which there are two major types insulin dependent diabetes mellitus IDDM or type I diabetes and non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM or type II diabetes. IDDM or juvenile onset diabetes is found mostly in young patients and is believed to be caused by genetically destructive mechanisms involving circulating antibodies to insulin which are aggravated by external factors such as infection viruses etc. toxic chemicals etc. As the name suggests insulin is required for the treatment of IDDM.

NIDDM or maturity onset diabetes is more common than IDDM and occurs mostly in adults either obese or non obese. In NIDDM there is a deficiency of insulin secretion or action. This deficiency may be due to down regulation of insulin receptors decreased sensitivity to insulin action or a post receptor defect in which the insulin signal is inefficiently or improperly transduced. About 70 of diabetics have NIDDM and require oral antidiabetic drugs either alone or in combination with insulin.

Insulin is typically required to be injected and is used for diabetics with insulinopenia who do not respond to diet oral drugs or both. Some of the possible side effects of insulin use are insulin antibody formation insulin resistance or allergic symptoms. Oral drugs for diabetes are generally of two types biguanides and sulphonylureas. These drugs are referred to as hypoglycemic drugs because they decrease blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. Oral drugs differ from insulin in their chemical structure and their mechanism of action.

Their primary mechanism of blood glucose lowering action is extra pancreatic i.e. they function by increasing the utilization of glucose in tissues e.g. liver and muscle decreasing the formation of glucose gluconeogenesis in liver and reducing the absorption of glucose from intestines. The increased utilization of glucose caused by biguanide drugs especially phenformin produces lactic acid which can cause lactic acidosis a serious side effect. For this and other reasons phenformin has been discontinued from use in some countries but is used occasionally in some other countries.

Particular examples of earlier sulphonylureas are tolbutamide orinase chlorpropamide acetohexamide dymelor and tolazamide tolinase . Their primary mechanism of action is to increase the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells in the islets of Langerhans which in turn reduces blood glucose levels. Sulphonylureas are also known to act on tissues other than the pancreas extrapancreatic effect like the liver. Many of these drugs have been replaced by more potent second generation sulphonylureas like glibenclamide gliclazide glitazones and glipizide. The latter drug has a longer duration of action up to 24 hours.

Because of its higher potency glibenclamide treatment frequently produces hypoglycemia decrease in blood glucose level below normal . Furthermore second generation sulphonylureas also produce serious side effects including myocarditis in some obese diabetics hyponatremia transient leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Long term use of these drugs over a number of years taken daily or more than once in a day is associated with hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia diabetic ketoacidosis and may cause coma allergic reactions leukopenia skin and gastrointestinal disturbances and predispose to coronary artery disease. Furthermore long term use often necessitates increased doses to achieve efficacy. Daily injection of insulin besides being painful may cause depression and other psychological problems.

Hypercholesterolemia can lead to cardiovascular disease CVD which accounts for a major proportion 23 of all deaths. Atherosclerosis together with its other complications is the pathological process that underlies the majority of coronary heart diseases CHD . Atherosclerosis is also responsible for thrombotic and embolic strokes aortic aneurymal disease renovascular hypertension peripheral vascular diseases and other clinical syndromes. Therefore prevention of atherosclerosis is of paramount importance for increasing human life span and for improving health.

Dietary habits contribute to the increased incidence of coronary and other atherosclerotic diseases. In particular the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol Stamler et al. 1988112 1032 along with high calories as well as a low fiber intake lead to high levels of total serum cholesterol and its atherogenic subfractions low density lipoproteins LDL and very low density lipoproteins VLDL and to high prevalence and incidence rates of hypercholesterolemia. Increased serum cholesterol is one of the major etiologically significant risk factors for CHD and other atherosclerotic diseases.

Medicinal properties have been attributed to this plant. Administration of whole seed powder purportedly prevented hyperglycemia induced by cadmium and alloxan in rats. T. Ghafghazi et al. 8 14 25 1977 . Powder from seeds taken every day for 10 days reduced fasting blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance in Type I diabetic patients. R. D. Sharma et al. 44 4 301 306 1990 . Seed powder was also asserted to have hypocholesterolemic effect. Y. Sauvaire et al. 26 3 191 197 1991 . These hypoglycemic and hypocholesterolemic activities have been attributed to either fiber or saponins. Coumarin a minor component of fenugreek seeds showed hypoglycemic effect however coumarin is toxic at all doses tested. Decoction of the seeds boiling in water purportedly improved severe diabetes and cured milder diabetes in humans. M. Moissides et al. 43 129 13 1979 .

The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings and from the claims.

The present invention is based in part on the isolation of a composition from Fenugreek seed having glucose lowering and cholesterol lowering activity in vivo. The composition includes one or more components that confer glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity. Thus the composition is useful for decreasing blood glucose improving glucose tolerance decreasing cholesterol or improving serum lipid profile in a subject and for treating physiological conditions pathologies associated with undesirable levels of glucose or cholesterol glucose intolerance or hypersensitivity and poor serum lipid profile. In addition the composition has other activities which indicate applicability in treating other disorders. For example the composition increases superoxide dismutase and or glutathione peroxidase enzyme. Thus the composition is also useful for reducing inflammation or cell injury or tissue damage resulting from free radical production as well as reducing mutagenesis which can lead to hyperplasia and or cancer due to it ability to reduce the amount of free radicals in a subject that cause tissue damage or contribute to cell hyperplasia cancer initiation or development or tumor promotion.

For example a patient with excessive or undesirable blood glucose levels e.g. hyperglycemic or with excessive or undesirable cholesterol levels e.g. hypercholesterolemic can be treated with the composition or a component present within the composition to decrease blood glucose or cholesterol levels. Decreased levels of blood glucose or cholesterol resulting from administering the composition can prevent inhibit or ameliorate some or all of the symptoms or pathologies associated with excessive or undesirable amounts of blood glucose or cholesterol e.g. diabetes familial hypercholesterolemia heart disease etc. . Thus in accordance with the invention there are provided methods for decreasing blood glucose improving glucose tolerance decreasing cholesterol and improving serum lipid profile.

The invention also provided methods for obtaining a composition having blood sugar e.g. glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity. In one embodiment a method of the invention includes producing an aqueous extract by contacting Papilinaceae Leguminosae seed or seed part with an aqueous solution having less than about 50 ethanol fractionating the extract to enrich for a component s having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity to remove a blood glucose increasing activity thereby obtaining a composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity without substantial blood glucose increasing activity. In one aspect the aqueous extract is obtained by contacting Fenugreek seed or seed part.

The composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity can be obtained from Fenugreek seed or seed part. Fenugreek is a member of the Papilinaceae Leguminosae plant family. Accordingly it is contemplated that the composition can be obtained from seed or seed part of any plant within this family.

The composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity can also be obtained from a seed at any stage of development immature or mature or germinating or germinated or a seed part including for example the embryo the endosperm and the surrounding layers e.g. coat . Those skilled in the art will know of methods to separate various parts of the seed to use as material to obtain an invention composition. Seed or seed parts include germinated seed. Germinated seed or seed part are typically from seeds germinated for 1 to 3 1 to 5 1 to 10 or 1 to 20 days or even longer more typically from 1 to 3 days. Furthermore seeds or seed parts having any amount of moisture content or none for that matter germinated or non germinated are contemplated as material useful for obtaining an invention composition. Thus moisture content is not to be construed as limiting the seed or seed part used to obtain the composition. Typical seed moisture content ranges from about 5 to 30 more typically 5 to 25 most typically 5 to 15 .

The aqueous extract can be produced by contacting Papilinaceae Leguminosae seed with an aqueous solution such as water for a period of time. In one embodiment Papilinaceae Leguminosae seed is soaked in an aqueous solution for at least about 2 hours. In another embodiment Papilinaceae Leguminosae seed is soaked in an aqueous solution for at least about 4 hours. In yet another embodiment Papilinaceae Leguminosae seed is soaked in an aqueous solution for at least about 8 hours. In still another embodiment Papilinaceae Leguminosae seed is soaked in an aqueous solution for at least about 12 hours.

Temperatures typically used during preparation of an invention composition from seed range from about 4 to about 30 C. More likely the temperature ranges between about 4 and 25 C. even more likely between about 4 and 20 C. and most likely between about 4 and 15 C. or between about 4 and 10 C. For longer extraction time periods e.g. greater than 8 hours between about 4 and 15 C. or between about 4 and 10 C. prevents excess loss of activity.

If desired the seed or seed part can be moistened rehydrated or presoaked prior to extracting. For example seed can be presoaked in a solution aqueous or organic the presoak solution removed and then the presoaked seed or seed part soaked in an aqueous solution to produce the aqueous extract.

As used herein the term aqueous solution refers to a liquid whose composition is about 50 or more water by volume. Typically the aqueous solution will have greater than about 60 water for example 70 80 90 or 100 water. In one embodiment the aqueous solution has less than about 50 ethanol. In another embodiment the aqueous solution has less than about 40 ethanol. In yet another embodiment the aqueous solution has less than about 30 ethanol. In other embodiments the aqueous solution has less than about 20 10 5 or less ethanol.

The aqueous solution can contain additional miscible or immiscible components. For example an aqueous solution can have buffering agents or salts to stabilize the pH. Particular examples of buffers are phosphate and HEPES buffers which can have a stabilized pH such as a pH in a physiological range between about pH 6.0 and about pH 8.0. Organic solvent e.g. phenol hexane acetone etc. can be present in the aqueous solution for the purpose of removing impurities or contaminants before during or after extraction. For example an organic solvent such as phenol can be mixed with the aqueous extract and separated from the aqueous solution by allowing the phases to partition. The apparent solubility properties of the composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity favor partitioning of the composition in the aqueous phase. The aqueous solution or aqueous extract can additionally contain solids such as activated carbon diatomaceous earth alumina and the like salts chelating agents preservatives and stabilizing agents which can be useful for removing impurities increasing the amount of glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering composition extracted from Papilinaceae Leguminosae seed or part or stabilizing or preventing degradation of the composition for example.

As used herein the phrases without substantial substantially without or substantially devoid means that the component referred to by the phrase is present in a relatively small amount or is completely absent. In the case of a blood glucose increasing activity i.e. without substantial blood glucose increasing activity this phrase means an amount of blood glucose increasing activity that does not significantly reduce a glucose lowering or insulin increasing activity. Typical amounts of blood glucose increasing activity present prior to fractionation reduce glucose lowering activity from about 50 100 . Significant reductions in glucose lowering activity typically are greater than about an 80 reduction of the blood glucose decreasing activity. Thus when the amount of blood glucose increasing activity present prior to fractionation reduces glucose lowering activity by 100 i.e. there is no blood glucose lowering activity present about 20 or more of the blood glucose increasing activity is removed. When the amount of blood glucose increasing activity present prior to fractionation reduces glucose lowering activity by 50 about 10 or more of the blood glucose increasing activity is removed. More likely blood glucose increasing activity is less than about 70 of the total activity most likely less than about a 60 of the total activity or less e.g. less than about 50 40 30 20 10 or less of activity such as 5 or 0 .

Thus in a composition of the invention there may be moderate amounts of glucose increasing activity remaining after fractionation. The amount present will generally be less than about 25 by mass of the total i.e. the combined mass of glucose lowering composition and glucose increasing component s . Typically the amount will be less than about 20 more typically less than about 10 and most typically less than about 5 for example 4 3 2 1 or 0 . The amount of glucose increasing activity present in a particular preparation of an invention composition can be determined by testing the composition using the assays disclosed herein and comparing activity to an invention composition in which glucose increasing component has been completely removed or its amount is known. In the therapeutic methods of the invention it is likely that the amount of glucose increasing component s in the composition will not prevent or substantially interfere with glucose lowering activity or cholesterol lowering activity of the invention.

Thus in a step of fractionating the extract to enrich for a component having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity the fractionated extract can contain an amount of glucose increasing activity. In one embodiment the amount of glucose increasing activity remaining after fractionating the extract is about 80 of the total amount of glucose increasing activity before fractionating the extract i.e. where blood glucose increasing activity is 100 prior to fractionation 20 of the glucose increasing activity has been removed by fractionation . In another embodiment the amount of glucose increasing activity remaining after fractionating the extract is about 70 of the total amount of glucose increasing activity before fractionating the extract i.e. where blood glucose increasing activity is 100 prior to fractionation 30 of the glucose increasing activity has been removed . In yet another embodiment the amount of glucose increasing activity remaining after fractionating the extract is about 60 of the total amount of glucose increasing activity before fractionating the extract. In still yet another embodiment the amount of glucose increasing activity remaining after fractionating the extract is about 50 of the total amount of glucose increasing activity before fractionating the extract. In various additional embodiments the amount of glucose increasing activity remaining after fractionating the extract is about 40 30 20 10 5 or less of the total amount of glucose increasing activity before fractionating the extract.

The aqueous extract can be fractionated using any of a variety of purification procedures known in the art so long as some amount of glucose increasing activity is removed from the composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity. In one embodiment a method of the invention includes fractionating by chromatography. In one aspect the chromatography is by anion exchange. In another aspect the chromatography is by weak anion exchange. In yet another aspect the chromatography is by DEAE cellulose. In still other aspects the chromatography is by DEAE sephadex or amberlite IR100. In another embodiment the protein in the extract can optionally be precipitated with full saturation ammonium sulfate precipitated proteins removed and the supernatant dialyzed or passed through DEAE cellulose to remove ammonium sulfate.

Other molecular fractionation procedures applicable in the methods of the invention include size based molecular fractionation for example size exclusion by gel filtration or by membrane filtration using a membrane having pore sizes through which only molecules having less than a certain size may pass gel electrophoresis and sucrose gradient centrifugation. Fractionation techniques useful in a method of the invention also include techniques that separate molecules on the basis of physical or chemical characteristics e.g. hydrophobicity hydrophilicity polarity affinity etc. which include for example thin layer chromatography TLC cation exchange strong or weak reverse phase hydrophobic interaction and affinity metal chelate antibody ligand receptor nucleic acid etc. . Fractionating the extract to obtain a composition having blood sugar lowering or cholesterol lowering activity can be performed with any of a variety of established techniques known in the art appropriate media for such fractionations are commercially available see e.g. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 1990 18th ed. Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. Pharmacia Biotech BioDirectory 96 .

The active fraction s can be identified using the in vitro and in vivo methods disclosed herein as well as by using the various physical and spectral characteristics described herein. The fractionated composition is typically greater than about 60 pure more likely 70 80 90 or more pure. Purity of the fraction can be determined by TLC HPLC or spectroscopy UV or visible see e.g. Example 2 .

If desired multiple fractionations can be performed. Thus in another embodiment a method of the invention includes additional fractionations i.e. two or more . In one aspect the composition obtained after a first fractionation is further fractionated by gel filtration chromatography. In another aspect the composition obtained after a first fractionation is further fractionated by SEPHADEX chromatography e.g. SEPHADEX G 25 G 100 . In yet another aspect the composition obtained after a first fractionation is further fractionated by TLC. In one aspect the TLC fractionation employs a low molecular weight alcohol e.g. n butanol acid and water solvent e.g. in a ratio of about 5 1 4 . In yet another embodiment the composition obtained after a first fractionation is further fractionated by HPLC.

It may be desired to change the volume of liquid or alter the buffer in a method of the invention. For example before fractionating the aqueous extract it may be desired to reduce the volume of liquid. To reduce the volume of liquid the material in the extract can be precipitated for example by adding a liquid in which the composition is insoluble. For example an equal or greater volume of ethanol or methanol can be added to the liquid to precipitate the composition. Alternatively the composition can be lyophilized using vacuum. The precipitate can be resuspended in a solution of the desired volume have buffering components appropriate for the fractionation for example. As an alternative in order to change solution volume or alter buffer dialysis can be performed.

A composition of the invention may contain a single component that has all of the hypoglycemic hypocholesterolemic and other activities described herein e.g. reversing histopathological changes increasing antioxidant enzymes etc. . Alternatively there may be multiple molecules i.e. subcomponents present within the composition each of which has one or more of the activities. The sum of the components would therefore account for the activities described herein.

Metabolites or intermediates of the composition and subfractions of the composition having one or more of the activities disclosed herein are also included. The metabolites or intermediates may be produced by the body s detoxification system e.g. cytochrome P450 enzymes etc. in order to facilitate their elimination. Active metabolites intermediates and subfractions can be identified as having structural similarity to an invention composition or an active component therein by using the activity assays described herein for example. Active metabolites or intermediates of an invention composition or any active subcomponent thereof or subfraction are useful in the methods of the invention for example treating a subject in which it is desired to produce one or more of the activities described herein. Such intermediates and metabolites can be produced by incubating a composition of the invention with gastric juice natural or artificial in vitro for example or in a liver homogenate. The composition any subcomponent any active metabolite or intermediate and any subfraction having one or more of the activities described herein are useful for treating a subject having hyperglycemia hypercholesterolemia or others described herein or known in the art.

A method of the invention including single or multiple fractionations each produce a composition having blood glucose lowering activity or cholesterol lowering activity without substantial glucose increasing activity. For example as shown in Flow Chart 1 fractionating the aqueous extract by chromatography DEAE cellulose produces an active yellow fraction referred to herein as Product 1 Menthi FII or simply FII having blood glucose lowering and cholesterol lowering activity. FII is mixture of water soluble compounds from fenugreek in which component s that increases blood glucose appears to be entirely or mostly absent. This compound also improves glucose tolerance increases insulin levels and improves serum lipid profile.

 Product 2 Menthi GII or simply GII is produced after fractionating of FII by Sephadex G100 chromatography. GII appears to be highly purified and almost homogenous see . This compound has inter alia blood glucose lowering activity improves glucose tolerance increases insulin levels and improves serum lipid profile. GII is highly potent when compared with other drugs. For example a dose of 50 mg kg body weight is useful even in ameliorating severe diabetes see e.g. Example III Table 4 Example VII Table 11 . In addition after treatment with GII fasting blood glucose levels returned to nearly normal value in diabetic and severely diabetic rabbits. Even after drug therapy was ceased fasting blood glucose level was maintained at a lower level for nearly ten days indicating prolonged efficacy.

Fractionation of GII by thin layer chromatography produced one and sometimes two spots. A single large spot was active and is referred to herein as TII. This compound also has inter alia blood glucose lowering activity improves glucose tolerance increases insulin levels and improves serum lipid profile. Accordingly the invention provides at least one substantially purified component i.e. greater than about 90 or more having one or more of the activities e.g. blood glucose lowering and other characteristics described herein.

Thus in accordance with the invention further provided are compositions having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity without substantial blood glucose increasing activity. In one embodiment the composition is free of glucose increasing activity. In another embodiment the composition is referred to as FII. In yet another embodiment the composition is referred to as GII. In still another embodiment a composition is referred to as TII. FII GII and TII compositions have one or more of the activities or physical characteristics described herein. The invention compositions including FII GII and TII are useful in the methods of treatment as described herein.

A composition of the invention has one or more of the activities e.g. blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity or physical characteristics described herein.

Particular examples of physical characteristics of a composition are a molecular weight of less than about 500 daltons soluble in water insoluble in organic solvent has an absorption peak of about 211 nm in alkali solution and 340 nm in acid and has an Rf value of about 0.65 on a TLC silica gel G plate having a mobile phase of alcohol n butanol acid and water in a ratio of about 5 1 4 volume volume.

In additional embodiments the composition is characterized by its functional activity e.g. glucose lowering activity insulin increasing activity cholesterol lowering activity improving serum lipid profile activity etc. in animals e.g. mammals . For example in one embodiment the composition reduces by about 20 or more blood glucose in an animal 2 hours after administering about 100 mg kg bodyweight b.w. of the composition to the animal. In another embodiment the composition reduces by about 20 or more blood glucose in an animal 2 hours after administering about 50 mg kg bodyweight of the composition to the animal. In yet another embodiment the composition reduces by about 20 or more blood glucose in an animal 2 hours after administering about 25 mg kg bodyweight of the composition to the animal. In still another embodiment the composition reduces by about 20 or more total cholesterol in a diabetic or severely diabetic animal 2 hours after administering about 50 mg kg bodyweight of the composition to the animal. Typically reduction in blood glucose or cholesterol levels will be 20 or more for example 30 50 or 60 or more.

An invention composition has glucose lowering activity in animals which means a reduction in the amount of sugar i.e. glucose present in the blood stream of an animal. An invention composition also produces directly or indirectly via a pancreatic or extra pancreatic pathway other hypoglycemic effects. For example a composition of the invention improves glucose tolerance and increases insulin levels in subdiabetic diabetic and severely diabetic animals see e.g. Tables 2 6 Table 10 .

In addition to decreasing blood glucose an invention composition directly or indirectly produces via a pancreatic or extra pancreatic pathway other hypoglycemic activities. For example an invention composition increases insulin levels and improves glucose tolerance in animals. An invention composition increases the number of islet cells regenerate of the pancreas see e.g. Example IX Table 13 or improves their function i.e. increase insulin production or release . An invention composition also stimulates activity or increases levels of enzymes of glucose utilization in glycolysis HMP and other pathways e.g. glucokinase in tissue of the body and decreases glucose formation gluconeogenesis enzymes and enzymes of the polyol pathway or activity or levels of enzymes e.g. glucose 6 phosphatase aldose reductase sorbitol dehydrogenase in these pathways see e.g. Tables 12 and 13 . A composition of the invention normalizes levels of malic enzyme. The extra pancreatic activity of an invention composition is corroborated by decreased fasting blood glucose in severely diabetic rabbits that have little if any pancreatic function see e.g. Table 4 .

Thus in accordance with the invention there are provided methods for decreasing blood sugar for increasing insulin for improving glucose tolerance for increasing the number or improving the function of pancreatic islet cells for increasing activity of enzymes of glucose utilization for decreasing activity or levels of enzymes of glucose formation. In one embodiment a method of the invention includes administering to a subject an amount of the composition having blood sugar lowering or cholesterol lowering activity effective to decrease blood sugar of the subject. In another embodiment a method of the invention includes administering to a subject an amount of the composition effective to increase the amount of insulin in the blood of the subject. In yet other embodiments an amount of the composition effective to improve glucose tolerance or to increase the number or improve the function of pancreatic islet cells to increase activity or levels of enzymes of glucose utilization to decrease activity or levels of enzymes of glucose formation is administered to the subject.

As disclosed herein an invention composition has inter alia cholesterol lowering activity. The phrase cholesterol lowering activity means a reduction in total blood cholesterol. The phrase therefore includes a decrease in VLDL or LDL which contain varying amounts of cholesterol. A composition of the invention also can reduce blood triglycerides and increase HDL see e.g. Tables 16 to 19 . The ability to reduce cholesterol VLDL LDL and triglycerides is referred to herein as improving serum lipid profile. Typically the reduction of cholesterol VLDL LDL or triglycerides will be at least about 10 . More typically the reduction will be 20 or more for example 30 50 60 80 or 100 or more e.g. 200 .

Thus in accordance with the invention there are provided methods of decreasing blood cholesterol triglycerides VLDL or LDL and for increasing HDL. In one embodiment a method of the invention includes administering to a subject an amount of the composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity effective to decrease blood cholesterol in the subject. In another embodiment a method of the invention includes administering to a subject an amount of the composition effective to decrease triglycerides in the subject. In yet other embodiments an amount of the composition effective to decrease VLDL LDL and increase HDL i.e. improve serum lipid profile or decrease LDL oxidation or amount of oxidized LDL is administered to the subject.

Although the invention is not bound by any theory the cholesterol lowering activity of an invention composition may be linked to insulin increasing activity. For example the hypocholesterolemic activity of the composition may result from an ability to increase hormone sensitive lipase activity which degrades lipids or decrease HMG CoA reductase activity an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Thus hypocholesterolemic activity of an invention composition may be directly or indirectly linked to its hypoglycemic activity or alternatively be due to a direct or indirect effect on cholesterol biosynthesis or degradative pathways. Increased HDL likely results from a decrease in cholesterol VLDL LDL or triglycerides. As some cardiovascular diseases are due to oxidized LDL it is likely that a composition of the invention inhibits LDL oxidation due to its antioxidant activity.

The term subject refers to an animal. Typically the animal is a mammal however any animal e.g. bird reptile etc. having glucose cholesterol or triglycerides present in blood is encompassed by the term. Particular examples of mammals are to primates humans dogs cats horses cows pigs and sheep. A subject can be hyperglycemic or hypercholesterolemic hyperglycemic and hypercholesterolemic or neither hyperglycemic nor hypercholesterolemic.

A subject having or at risk of having a hyperglycemic or hypercholesterolemic condition or an undesirable amount of blood glucose or cholesterol or a pathology resulting from or associated with a hyperglycemic or hypercholesterolemic condition chronic or acute can therefore be treated by administering an invention composition. There are many chronic or acute hyperglycemic and hypercholesterolemic conditions that are associated with create an increased risk of or which result from hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia. Particular examples of hyperglycemic conditions treatable by a method of the invention include the various types of diabetes for example insulin dependent insulin independent and severe diabetes. Hyperglycemic conditions associated with caused by or at an increased risk due to diabetes include for example ischemic cerbrovascular disease or stroke brain infarction postischemic brain injury diabetic retinopathy eye damage neuropathy autonomic nephropathy kidney damage skin infections and other cutaneous disorders slow healing of injuries or wounds diabetic carbuncles cataracts diabetic foot and accelerated periodontitis.

Particular examples of hypercholesterolemic conditions treatable by a method of the invention include arteriosclerosis coronary heart disease hypertension stroke and blood vessel thrombosis. Thus a subject can be administered an amount of the composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity effective to ameliorate a hyperglycemic or hypercholesterolemic condition in the subject such conditions including those described herein and others known in the art.

As disclosed herein a composition of the invention decreases cholesterol and improves serum lipid profile of hypercholesterolemic animals see e.g. Tables 16 19 . The improvement in serum lipid profile occurs without inducing hypoglycemia. Thus in another embodiment the invention provides methods for decreasing cholesterol and improving serum lipid profile in a subject without producing hypoglycemia in the subject. A method of the invention includes administering to a subject an amount of a composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity sufficient to improve serum lipid profile without producing hypoglycemia in the subject.

A composition of the invention also prevents or reverses histopathological changes associated with hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia. For example fat infiltration and fatty cysts present in liver of severely diabetic animals were absent in animals treated with GII see e.g. Example IX compare also to . Fatty infiltration of the myocardium also was completely reversed in animals treated with GII. Improvements in pancreas function and histopathology were also evident in animals administered GII. For example pancreas of severely diabetic animals revealed significant fatty infiltration and islet cells were either absent or few in number. Treatment reversed fatty infiltration and the number of islet cells either increased i.e. regenerated see e.g. or their function improved i.e. increased insulin production or release.

Thus the invention also provides methods for preventing inhibiting and reversing histopathological changes associated with or that result from hyperglycemic and hypercholesterolemic conditions. A method of the invention includes administering an effective amount of a composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity effective to prevent a histopathological change improve a histopathological change or reverse a histopathological change associated with or resulting from a hyperglycemic or hypercholesterolemic condition. In one embodiment the improvement is in pancreas e.g. increased function or number of islets etc. . In another embodiment the improvement is in kidney e.g. decrease in calcification fatty infiltration etc. . In yet another embodiment the improvement is in liver e.g. decrease in fatty infiltration . In still another embodiment the improvement is in blood vessel e.g. decrease in plaque such as in the aorta . In other embodiments the improvement is in eye e.g. decrease or an arrest of retinopathy decrease in cataracts improvement in vision or wound or injury healing time decreased or diabetic foot. Free radicals are generated as a result of metabolic processes which in turn cause peroxidation of lipids. Lipid peroxidation products cause damage to many tissues in the body. Antioxidant defense mechanisms counteract these undesirable effects. An invention composition also has the ability inter alia to reduce the amount of free radicals produced in diabetes and which may account for complications associated with diabetes. For example the level of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase increase in diabetics treated with a composition of the invention see e.g. Table 14 .

Thus in accordance with the invention also provided are methods of increasing antioxidant enzymes and decreasing free radicals. In one embodiment a method of the invention includes administering an amount of an invention composition effective to increase glutathione peroxidase. In another embodiment a method of the invention includes administering an amount of an invention composition effective to increase superoxide dismutase in a subject. In yet another embodiment a method of the invention includes administering an amount of an invention composition effective to decrease free radicals in the body.

Free radicals can produce cellular and tissue damage mutations of cellular components e.g. DNA protein or activate procarcinogens which in turn can lead to various physiological conditions and pathological disorders. Such disorders can be produced by insufficient production of antioxidant enzymes for example superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase or undesirable or overproduction of free radicals during inflammation for example. Thus reducing free radicals in a subject or increasing antioxidant enzyme s can ameliorate a condition associated with the presence of free radicals in the subject.

Accordingly the invention provides methods of ameliorating physiological conditions associated with free radicals. In one embodiment a method of the invention includes administering to a subject an amount of an invention composition effective to ameliorate a pathological disorder associated with insufficient antioxidant enzyme production or expression. In another embodiment a method of the invention includes administering to a subject an amount of an invention composition effective to ameliorate a pathological disorder associated with free radicals. Such disorders include for example cell injury or tissue damage produced by free radicals e.g. iscehmia during inflammation as well as cell transformation due to mutagenesis caused by free radicals which can lead to hyperplasia cancer development or initiation or tumor promotion.

As used herein the term ameliorate means an improvement in the subject s condition a reduction in the severity of the condition or an inhibition of progression or worsening of the condition. In the case of a hyperglycemic condition e.g. diabetes for example an improvement can be a decrease in blood glucose an increase in insulin an improvement in glucose tolerance and improved pancreatic e.g. islet cell function. An improvement in a hyperglycemic condition also can include a decrease in a pathology associated with or resulting from the condition such as an improvement in histopathology of pancreas e.g. regeneration of islet cells that produce insulin kidney reduction or reversal of tubule calcification liver or eye. In the case of a hypercholesterolemic condition e.g. arteriosclerosis resulting from excess blood cholesterol triglycerides VLDL or LDL an improvement can be a decrease in blood cholesterol triglycerides VLDL or LDL an increase in HDL or a decrease in luminal thickening of a blood vessel e.g. coronary artery . An improvement in a hypercholesterolemic condition also can include improvement in any of the various disorders well known in the art to be associated with hypercholesterolemia for example a decrease in intimal thickening of the coronary artery fatty infiltration of myocardium or liver hypertension i.e. high blood pressure or thrombus formation or size.

An effective amount means the amount of an invention composition needed to produce a therapeutic effect or improvement in the condition. A therapeutic effect can be a small or moderate reduction of blood glucose or cholesterol levels for example. Typical improvements can be a reduction of about 10 20 30 or more for example 40 50 60 70 80 of blood glucose or cholesterol levels. Typical increases in insulin levels are about 10 20 more typical 30 40 and most typical 50 60 or more.

Doses that are sufficient to ameliorate hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia or pathologies associated with or that result from hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia can be readily ascertained by the skilled artisan. Appropriate doses will depend upon the condition treated the therapeutic effect desired as well as the individual subject e.g. whether the subject is hyperglycemic or hypercholesterolemic or not the bioavailability within the subject gender age etc. . Typically the dose at which hypoglycemic activity is observed is in the range of about 10 to about 25 mg composition kg subject mass 25 to about 50 mg composition kg subject mass or about 50 to about 100 mg composition kg subject mass. For example as disclosed herein administering the composition at low doses e.g. 50 mg kg subject mass decreases blood glucose increases insulin and improves serum lipid profile. However it is possible to administer greater doses e.g. a dose of 100 to about 200 mg composition kg subject mass or 200 to about 500 mg composition kg subject mass daily for example in the case of a subject having severe or chronic hyperglycemia e.g. severe diabetes or hypercholesterolemia or where a rapid blood sugar lowering or cholesterol lowering effect is desired.

The composition can be administered to the subject by any means appropriate for the condition to be treated. For example the composition can be administered orally to inhibit or prevent acute or chronic hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia in a subject having or at risk of having acute or chronic hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia for example due to a genetic or other predisposing factor such as an inability or deficiency in regulating blood glucose or cholesterol e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia . Thus in one embodiment a composition is administered orally. A composition can be administered prophylactically to a subject prior to development of symptoms associated with or resulting from the condition for example to prevent or inhibit hyperglycemia in diabetic subjects that occurs with age onset exposure to high amounts of dietary glucose or after glucose from food consumption to prevent neuropathy nephropathy retinopathy diabetic foot cutaneous infection diabetic cataracts etc. Similarly the composition can be administered prophylactically to a subject to decrease the risk of developing fatty deposits in tissues and organs which lead to athersclerosis and increased risk of stroke for example. Moreover an invention composition can be administered before during or after surgery e.g. bypass surgery or angioplasty stroke or cardiac arrest.

Accordingly a composition of the invention can be formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable carriers diluents or excipients for internal or external e.g. topical administration. Thus pharmaceutical formulations including a composition having blood glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity are provided. In one embodiment a pharmaceutical formulation includes a pill tablet or capsule . In another embodiment a pharmaceutical formulation includes a syrup or elixir or other liquid suitable for oral consumption. In yet another embodiment a pharmaceutical formulation includes an ointment. In still another embodiment a pharmaceutical formulation includes a formulation for application to the eye e.g. eye drops . Topical formulations could increase glucose utilization at the site of application i.e. locally thereby ameliorating the condition.

Such pharmaceutical formulations including an invention composition can be administered alone or in combination with other glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering drugs. Thus the invention also provides pharmaceutical formulations including an invention composition and one or more drugs having glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity as well as methods of treatment using such composition combinations. Of course the skilled artisan will recognize that any drug having glucose lowering or cholesterol lowering activity can be used in a therapeutic regimen e.g. a method of the invention in combination with an invention composition even if the other drug is not present in the same pharmaceutical formulation as an invention composition.

The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will be in a pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically acceptable formulation. As used herein the terms pharmaceutically acceptable and physiologically acceptable refer to carriers diluents excipients and the like that can be administered to a subject preferably without producing excess adverse side effects e.g. hypoglycemia nausea headaches diarrhea etc. . Such preparations for administration include sterile aqueous or non aqueous solutions suspensions and emulsions. Examples of non aqueous solvents are propylene glycol polyethylene glycol vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water alcoholic aqueous solutions emulsions or suspensions including saline and buffered media. Vehicles include sodium chloride solution Ringer s dextrose dextrose and sodium chloride lactated Ringer s or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles include fluid and nutrient replenishers electrolyte replenishers such as those based on Ringer s dextrose and the like. Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as for example antimicrobials anti oxidants chelating agents and inert gases and the like. Various pharmaceutical formulations appropriate for administration are known in the art and are applicable in the methods and compositions of the invention e.g. 1990 18th ed. Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. and 1996 12th ed. Merck Publishing Group Whitehouse N.J. .

Prolonging the duration of action or controlled delivery of an administered composition can be achieved by incorporating the composition into particles or a polymeric substance such as polyesters polyamine acids hydrogel polyvinyl pyrrolidone ethylene vinylacetate methylcellulose carboxymethylcellulose protamine sulfate or lactide glycolide copolymers polylactide glycolide copolymers or ethylenevinylacetate copolymers. The rate of release of the composition can be controlled by altering the concentration or composition of such macromolecules. For example it is possible to entrap the composition in microcapsules prepared by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example by the use of hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsules or poly methylmethacrolate microcapsules respectively or in a colloid drug delivery system. Colloidal dispersion systems include macromolecule complexes nano capsules microspheres beads and lipid based systems including oil in water emulsions micelles mixed micelles and liposomes.

Thus the compositions of the invention can be formulated in any pharmaceutically acceptable substance and administered in accordance with any protocol that achieves the desired effect. For example a composition formulated into a capsule pill or elixir or syrup can be administered orally once or more per day e.g. at a low dose or intermittently e.g. every other day once a week etc. at a higher dose . The composition can be administered by other routes including for example intravenous intravascular intraperitoneal intramuscular subcutaneous or intracavity. Thus if a localized effect on the pancreas is desired the composition can be formulated in Ringer s dextrose and injected into or near the pancreas e.g. via the portal vein for example.

Unless otherwise defined all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention suitable methods and materials are described herein.

All publications patents and other references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In case of conflict the present specification including definitions will control.

A number of embodiments of the invention have been described. Nevertheless it will be understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the following examples are intended to illustrate but not limit the scope of invention described in the claims.

Fenugreek seeds 100 gms were extracted with 300 ml of distilled water overnight at 4 C. The next morning the water extract was decanted centrifuged at 1000 rpm in the cold for 10 minutes and filtered. Purification is carried out at 4 C. to minimize loss in activity at room temperature. Soaking longer than 24 hours can result in reduction in activity. Removal of proteins by precipitation with ammonium sulphate saturation separation of protein from supernatant and removal of ammonium sulfate gives a protein free active extract indicating that the active compound is not a protein. Protein precipitation is optional because this did not alter activity or purity of the compound after the chromatography step. Boiling in water destroys the composition.

DEAE cellulose was purified by washing with 0.1 N NaOH until there was no yellow color in wash. The DEAE cellulose was washed with distilled water to remove NaOH followed by 0.1 N HCl neutralization and several washings with distilled water to remove HCl pH was that of the water . The purified DEAE cellulose was packed in a glass column 4 30 cm and washed with distilled water at 4 C. The water extract of fenugreek seeds 50 ml was loaded on the column. As the sample moved down the column bed it was separated into two prominent bands The uppermost band is dark brown in color and is hyperglycemic increases blood glucose level and the lower light yellow band is active e.g. hypoglycemic . Below the light yellow band the whole column is light yellowish in color and the compounds in this region do not appear to have significant blood glucose lowering activity.

Batchwise or gradient elution with water and other buffers did not elute the active compound. In one method the top brown layer was stirred with water and siphoned out without losing or disturbing the material below it. After removing the dark brown layer the DEAE cellulose was carefully removed from the column by inverting it and gently tapping. The light yellow active band was cut out. In another method the entire column is removed and the lower light yellow active band was cut out and processed further. The light yellow active band was extracted with 0.1 N HCl centrifuged at 3 000 rpm for 15 minutes and the supernatant neutralized with 0.1 N NaOH. This partially purified preparation after lyophilization is referred to herein as Product 1.

Sephadex G100 of particle size 40 120 was purified by overnight swelling in distilled water and de aeration under vacuum by boiling in a water bath for 45 min. The thick slurry was packed in a glass column of 5 30 cm and equilibrated with water in a cold room. The DEAE purified fraction was carefully loaded on the top of the Sephadex column and the sample allowed to run down the column bed. It was eluted with water at a rate of about 0.5 ml. per minute and 10 ml fractions were collected and pooled into four fractions according to color. The second light yellow fraction designated G II had significant hypoglycemic activity.

The fraction from step 3 was separated by thin layer chromatography on silica gel G 0.25 mm thick plates activated at 110 C. for 1 hour using n butanol acetic acid water 5 1 4 v v as solvent. A single spot with iodine vapors was visible although occasionally there were two spots in which the major spot was active. When two spots were present the silica gel having the major band was scraped and extracted with 0.1 N HCl centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and neutralized with 0.1 N NaOH. The yield of the TLC purified composition was very low.

It is freely soluble in water acid and alkali and insoluble in organic solvents. It is colorless in acidic 0.1N HCl medium. It becomes yellow in color upon addition of alkali 0.1 N NaOH but on neutralization with acid becomes colorless.

The compound is stable in aqueous solution at 4 C. for about three weeks. When stored in a frozen state 20 C. it is stable for at least 2 3 months. Alkali treatment seems to decompose the group with peak at 340 nm. It is also stable in lyophilized form to a greater extent that in the aqueous form.

The absorption spectrum of Sephadex GII fraction in the UV and visible region in acid and alkali were studied and the absorption maxima shown in Table 1. In 0.1 N HCl the compound showed absorption maximum of 205 268 and 340 nm. In alkali the absorption maxima were at 211 276 390 and 402 nm.

The absorption spectrum of TLC purified fraction TII and the maximum absorption values are shown in Table 1. In the acidic medium the TLC purified fraction had three peaks as with GII. But in the alkaline medium there were two peaks at 211 and 270 nm as against four peaks at 211 276 390 and 402 nm seen with the Sephadex GII fraction. This indicates that the compound with peak at 340 nm in acid medium is unstable in alkaline medium. The two compounds with peaks at 390 and 402 nm seen with alkali in sephadex GII fraction are removed during purification by TLC. The infrared spectra is shown in Table 1.

Comparison of fenugreek GII absorption spectrum with trigonelline and nicotinic acid in the UV and visible region in acid and alkaline medium reveals that the fenugreek composition is different from trigonelline and nicotinic acid.

Since the Sephadex GII and TLC II fractions are active the compound s with peaks at 205 270 and 340 nm in acid medium likely accounts for one or more of the biological activities. The compound s having peaks at 390 and 402 nm in alkali present in Sephadex GII fraction absent in TLC II fraction are unlikely to be active and appear to be a contaminant s present in small amounts.

This example describes a comparison of physical characteristics between fenugreek composition trigonellene and nicotonic acid.

One alkaloid trigonelline and nicotinic acid were isolated from fenugreek seeds by others. Any similarity between the structures will be revealed by comparing the UV absorption spectra of the Menthi composition with trigonelline and nicotinic acid. A comparison of the UV and IR spectra of Menthi with trigonelline and nicotinic acid reveals that the two compounds are different although there are some similarities between them.

The absorption spectrum of trigonelline in acid showed a single peak at 264 nm. In alkali trigonelline showed two peaks at 263 and 275 nm. Nicotinic acid also showed a single peak at 259 nm in acid. The group with a peak at 340 nm seen with the purified fenugreek composition is absent in both trigonelline and nicotinic acid which have groups with peaks below 264 nm. However Menthi has peaks at 268 nm and above Table 1 . The infrared spectrum of trigonelline is different from that of Menthi.

Trigonelline is a derivative of nicotinic acid. Therefore the fenugreek composition Menthi may be a derivative of nicotinic acid and related to but different from trigonelline. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH the coenzyme form of nicotinic acid has a maximum absorption of 340 nm. The fenugreek composition could be a nicotinic acid derivative and a nucleotide similar to but not identical to NADH however NADH is not known to have antidiabetic activity.

As disclosed herein the fenugreek composition has hypocholesterolemic activity. It is also noted that compounds with hypocholesterolemic activity which are structurally saponins were reported in fenugreek seeds. Y. Sauvaire et al. 26 3 191 197 1991 . However the fenugreek composition is distinct from saponins and sapogenins.

Menthi GII in acid shows absorption maxima at 205 268 and 340 nm. In alkali shows absorption maxima at 211 276 370 and 402 nm. Menthi TII in acid shows absorption maxima at 205 270 and 340 nm. In alkali shows absorption maxima at 211 and 270 nm.

This example describes animal studies demonstrating the in vivo glucose lowering activity of the fenugreek composition.

The above TLC analysis indicates that the composition obtained after Sephadex gel filtration is primarily a single band. Thus there is no additional advantage of purification by thin layer chromatography after Sephadex gel filtration and furthermore the yield of TLC purified material is very poor. The studies were therefore carried out with Sephadex GII fraction referred to as Menthi Menthi GII or simply GII.

Destruction of beta cells in islets of Langerhans in the pancreas of animals is the most commonly used method of inducing hyperglycemia diabetes in animals. Alloxan is used in rabbits. Overnight fasted rabbits 1 to 1.5 kg were administered 80 mg kg body weight bw alloxan solution intravenously prepared in 0.7 sterile NaCl pH adjusted to 4.5 with solid citric acid through the marginal ear vein. If any of the rabbits showed signs of hypoglycemia in 6 8 hours due to sudden release of insulin 25 glucose solution was given orally by gastric intubation. A rabbit pellet diet Hindustan Levers Bombay was provided four hours after alloxan injection. Blood glucose was tested at intervals of 5 days. Urine was also tested for glucose by Qualitative Benedicts reagent by adding 8 drops of urine to 5 ml of the reagent and boiling for 2 minutes. Orange to reddish precipitate indicates diabetes in the animals.

Usually after 30 days of alloxan injection the animals reached a stabilized state of diabetes. Only rabbits with stabilized diabetic state were used for the studies. We produced three types of diabetic rabbits similar to sub diabetic diabetic and severely diabetic states in humans. The rabbits were arbitrarily divided into three groups 1 subdiabetic 2 diabetic and 3 severely diabetic rabbits.

In some of the rabbits fasting blood or plasma glucose levels initially increased after alloxan injection but decreased to normal or slightly elevated levels up to 120 mg dl . However these rabbits showed decreased glucose tolerance plasma glucose took much longer than the usual 2.5 hours time to return to normal after oral glucose load. This condition in rabbits is similar to the subdiabetic state in humans.

Rabbits with elevated fasting plasma glucose FPG or fasting blood glucose FBG levels in the range of 120 250 mg dl were classified as diabetic. Glucose tolerance was abnormal in these animals with plasma glucose values remaining much higher than normal even 2.5 hours after oral glucose load. This condition is similar to NIDDM in humans.

Rabbits with FPG or FBG values above 250 mg dl were considered to be severely diabetic. When a glucose tolerance test GTT was performed most of the animals died. Thus oral GTT was avoided in this group of rabbits. Severely diabetic rabbits with FPG values closer to 400 mg dl are similar to human IDDM patients.

Diabetes can be induced in other animals by various methods. Of the various animals diabetes induced in rabbits more closely mimics human diabetes. But rats and mice also can be used. For example diabetes can be induced in rats with streptozotocin using standard methods known in the art. Streptozotocin induced diabetes in rats resembles NIDDM of humans.

Plasma glucose was determined as a measure of blood glucose of the animals. Fasting blood glucose was determined once a week for one month with an enzymatic glucose oxidase peroxidase kit of M S Ranbaxy Diagnostics New Delhi or Stangen Immunodiagnostics Hyderabad India as described by the manufacturer. Blood was collected and plasma separated by centrifugation at 1000 rpm at room temperature for 10 minutes was analyzed for glucose. Hemolysed samples were rejected. The supernatant plasma was stored in the refrigerator until analysis as early as possible after collection. Working solution of the kit prepared was mixed with 10 ml of water for blank standard glucose provided in the kit or plasma for test and incubated at 37 C. for 15 minutes. Intensity of red color was measured by absorbance at 505 nm. Plasma glucose was calculated from the optical density values of standard glucose minus blank and test sample minus blank using the formula given in the instructions of the manufacturer. Rabbits with consistently high fasting plasma glucose values of 150 200 mg dl were used.

Blood 2 ml was collected in tubes containing suitable anticoagulant from overnight fasted diabetic rabbits. One group of rabbits was given a 50 mg kg water solution of Menthi GII administered orally by Ryle s tube and the second group received the same volume of water without GII. After 90 minutes 2 ml blood was again drawn. The plasma glucose of this sample indicates the glucose lowering activity of Menthi GII just 90 minutes after administration. This blood sample 90 minutes after administering GII also serves as the zero hour sample in the glucose tolerance test. The rabbits were then given glucose 2 g kg bw in 15 ml water orally and blood samples collected after one and two hours and the glucose levels determined.

Menthi GII fraction decreases plasma glucose in the zero hour fasting 1 hour and 2 hour of animals when compared with the untreated animals which received water only in place of Menthi GII . The decrease is greater in 1 hour and 2 hour plasma glucose values than in the zero hour samples. The average decrease in 1 hour and 2 hour plasma glucose produced by a single GII dose in these rabbits is typically greater than about 20 or more of the untreated rabbit s .

In subdiabetic and diabetic rabbits after overnight fasting blood was drawn in the morning from marginal ear vein. After 90 min blood was again drawn and the glucose tolerance test was performed by giving glucose 2 g kg solution orally. Blood samples were again drawn 1 and 2.5 hours after glucose load and the Plasma glucose from each of the blood samples was determined.

In untreated subdiabetic and diabetic rabbits plasma glucose remains at higher than normal levels for a much longer time period than in normal rabbits. Since the plasma glucose levels are nearly normal or slightly elevated in subdiabetic rabbits after treatment with an antidiabetic drug there may or may not be any detectable change in fasting plasma glucose FPG . In fact a decrease in FPG below normal i.e. hypoglycemia is also not desirable. Thus improvement in glucose tolerance was used as a parameter for antidiabetic activity in subdiabetic rabbits.

In diabetic rabbits which have elevated blood glucose levels assessment of antidiabetic activity was detected by a decrease in FPG as well as an improvement in glucose tolerance. In severely diabetic rabbits glucose tolerance test cannot be used because the animals might die after oral glucose load and therefore assessment was by detecting a decrease in FPG after treatment.

A single dose 50 mg kg bw did not produce a detectable decrease in fasting blood glucose in any of the three types of diabetes. However in the glucose tolerance test there was improvement in glucose tolerance with about 25 35 reduction in plasma glucose values 1 hour after oral glucose load. These results indicate that even a single 50 mg kg dose can improve glucose tolerance in subdiabetic as well as in diabetic rabbits.

Long Term Administration of the Fenugreek Compound Restores Fasting Blood Glucose and Glucose Tolerance to Normal in Diabetic Rabbits 

Fenugreek composition was administered orally once a day in the morning at a dose of 50 mg kg bw for the duration indicated below. Hindustan Lever rabbit food and water were given ad libitum except when glucose tolerance test was performed or when fasting glucose was determined in which case food was withdrawn the previous night in order to produce overnight fasted rabbits.

Fasting plasma glucose There was a 10 decrease in FPG which continued to remain in the normal range after 12 days of treatment. This decrease was not surprising because in this type of rabbit FPG is normal or only slightly elevated. This result implies that the fenugreek composition has no adverse effect of lowering blood glucose to an undesirable level such as causing coma due to hypoglycemia.

Glucose tolerance After 6 days of treatment there was 32 35 decrease in plasma glucose in the glucose tolerance test. After 12 days of daily treatment the glucose tolerance pattern was completely normal with a 50 reduction in 1 hour plasma glucose Table 2 .

In the diabetic rabbits after 12 days of treatment fasting plasma glucose returned to normal 90.1 4 md dl from the pre treatment level of 150.1 14 mg dl. After 15 days of treatment GTT returned to normal Table 3 .

In severely diabetic rabbits with very high initial fasting plasma glucose of 427.8 46 mg dl there was a 50 reduction in FPG after one week s treatment. After four weeks treatment FPG decreased to near normal 110.1 11 mg dl a decrease of 75 Table 4 . These severely diabetic rabbits resemble human IDDM patients in which fasting blood glucose levels are reduced to a level of about 120 mg dl by insulin injection. The data in animals administered fenugreek composition which produce good control of plasma glucose to levels below 150 mg dl after only 15 days of oral treatment indicate the potency of the composition. Also noteworthy is that glucose tolerance tests could be conducted in the treated severely diabetic rabbits and the glucose tolerance curve for these treated animals was close to normal. This result contrasts with glucose tolerance test before fenugreek composition treatment which usually resulted in death of the rabbits.

The data in Table 4 show that in a severe diabetic condition in which insulin injection is the only treatment this fenugreek composition controlled glucose in 2 weeks and reduced fasting blood glucose to nearly normal in 4 weeks. These results demonstrate that the fenugreek composition in itself is very potent at a small dose of 50 mg kg in controlling not only diabetes but severe diabetes. Thus an advantage of the fenugreek composition is that oral treatment can be given from the beginning without the need to administer insulin initially.

One method in which to minimize the possibility of drug side effects is to administer the drug as infrequently as possible while still achieving the desired biological effect. Intermittent therapy of once a week Menthi administration was studied in subdiabetic and diabetic rabbits and the effect on glucose tolerance is shown in Table 5. In both subdiabetic and diabetic rabbits there was a decrease in 2.5 hours plasma glucose by the end of the first week. Subsequently there was an additional progressive improvement in glucose tolerance of both groups of animals GTT returned to normal by about five weeks. FPG returned to normal by three weeks in diabetic rabbits.

These results demonstrate that 1 effective control of subdiabetes and diabetes can be achieved by once a week Menthi GII administration and 2 a single dose of Menthi GII has a prolonged duration of action of nearly one week because there was no increase of plasma glucose between the weekly doses.

This example describes studies comparing the activity of Menthi from fenugreek seed to trigonelline tolbutamide and saponins.

The antidiabetic activity of GII Menthi and the alkaloid trigonelline which can be isolated from fenugreek seeds were compared. Diabetic rabbits were administered the same dose 100 mg kg day daily for 3 days. The activity of these two was also compared with a standard drug tolbutamide all at the same dosage schedule of 100 mg Kg day for 3 days. The improvement in glucose tolerance i.e. percent decrease in blood glucose at 2.5 hours in glucose tolerance test after oral glucose load in diabetic rabbits is shown in Table 6.

The results show that the alkaloid trigonelline was less potent than Menthi in the diabetic rabbits the percent decrease in blood glucose produced by trigonelline was only half of that produced by Menthi GII . These results are consistent with the findings of Mishinsky J. Shani Mishinsky et al. Lancet 16 1311 1312 1967 who isolated trigonelline from fenugreek seeds and reported that it has only mild and transient hypoglycemic activity. This indicates that Menthi is different from and more potent than trigonelline.

Menthi also has greater activity than the standard drug tolbutamide. It is noted that tolbutamide requires a functional pancreas for its activity and is useful only in mild diabetes but not in severe diabetes. In contrast Menthi from fenugreek seed is effective in treating severely diabetic animals.

A steroidal sapogenin referred to as fenugreekine was isolated from fenugreek seeds by S. Ghosal et al. Phytochemistry 13 10 2247 1974 . Studies of the antidiabetic activity of this compound as described by S. Ghosal et al. revealed that it could not lower blood glucose during GTT in diabetic rabbits. Thus Menthi is distinct from the steroidal saponins and sapogenins isolated by many workers Y. Sauvaire et al. Lipids 26 3 191 197 1991 J. Shani Mishinsky et al. Lancet 16 1311 1312 1967 as well as apparently being more potent.

This example describes studies showing that Menthi decreases glycosylated hemoglobin in diabetic animals.

In diabetic rabbits glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1 remains elevated above the normal range. The level of HbA1 is considered a reliable index of control of the diabetic state because it reflects long term blood glucose levels over approximately 3 months. In diabetic rabbits glycosylated HbA1 increased slightly to the upper limit of normal range FPG was 150.4 14 mg dl and HbA1 3.9 0.3 Tables 7 and 8 . This increase was reversed by treatment with fenugreek composition Menth 50 mg kg day for four weeks both FPG and HbA1 decreased to normal 90.5 5 mg dl and 2.6 0.2 respectively.

In severely diabetic rabbits before treatment the FPG was 427.8 46 mg dl and Hb A1 4.5 0.4 . After four weeks treatment both FPG and HbA1 decreased to near normal levels 110 11 mg dl and 3.1 0.3 respectively Table 8 .

An additional conclusion based on the data in Table 8 is that in the diabetic rabbits continuation of treatment up to 4 weeks did not produce hypoglycemia even though FPG decreases to normal by 2 weeks. These results therefore indicate that the fenugreek composition reduces glucose levels without producing hypoglycemia.

This example describes studies showing that fenugreek composition improves carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in several tissues.

In diabetes liver and muscle glycogen are depleted to provide glucose to the body. Normal glycogen content of rabbit liver was 27.1 3 mg gm liver and in diabetes it decreased to 9.1 2 mg gm. After Menthi treatment 50 mg kg day for 15 days liver glycogen increased to the normal 28.0 4 mg gm. Similarly in muscle normal glycogen content was 14.0 3 mg gm and in diabetic rabbits it decreased to 6.8 1 mg gm. After treatment for 15 days muscle glycogen increased to 11.1 1 mg gm.

In severe diabetes liver and muscle glycogen decreased to 9.6 1 and 5.1 1 mg gm tissue respectively. After Menthi treatment for 30 days glycogen increased to normal 22.1 4 and 12.9 1 mg gm tissue respectively. The data demonstrate that treatment with Menthi restored glycogen content of both liver and muscle in diabetic as well as in severely diabetic rabbits.

As shown in Table 9 body weight which decreased in diabetes returned to normal in diabetes in 15 days and in severe diabetes in 30 days.

This example describes studies showing that the fenugreek composition increases insulin levels in animals.

Antidiabetic or hypoglycemic drugs can function by more than one mechanism. One mechanism is pancreatic beta cryotropic action which stimulates the release or synthesis of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates pathways of glucose utilization thereby reducing blood glucose. This mechanism is possible only if the pancreas at least in part is functional. The second mechanism is by the direct action of the drugs on the tissues to stimulate pathways of glucose utilization. This mechanism is referred to as extra pancreatic effect or peripheral action. Sulphonylurea type drugs act mostly by the first mechanism although several of them stimulate glucose utilization directly.

In diabetic rabbits insulin levels in fasting blood and in the blood samples 1 hour and 2 hours after oral glucose load during GTT were determined before and after 15 days treatment. Insulin levels were determined using Boehringer Manheim Germany kits by an ELISA method.

The results shown in Table 10 indicate that insulin secretion both in fasting condition and 1 hour and 2 hours after oral glucose load was considerably reduced in diabetic rabbits in comparison to non diabetic control animals. However treatment with Menthi for 15 days increased serum insulin not only in fasting state but also after oral glucose load. These results indicate that continuing treatment will continue to increase insulin levels to normal levels because blood glucose levels were normal. These results indicate that one mechanism by which the fenugreek compositions function is pancreatic i.e. by increasing serum insulin levels.

In severely diabetic rabbits GTT could not be performed because of the possibility of death. Therefore the effect of Menthi treatment was studied on fasting serum insulin levels. The results in Table 11 show that in severely diabetic rabbits serum insulin was very low. Treatment with Menthi for 30 days increased serum insulin by approximately 15 . This increase may be due to regeneration of pancreas which causes insulin producing or secreting function. Treatment for longer periods of time may further increase serum insulin levels. Fasting blood glucose in severely diabetic rabbits decreased to nearly normal 110 11 mg dl from a very high 427 46 mg dl. This data shows that the activity of Menthi in severely diabetic rabbits was due in part to increasing serum insulin levels but was primarily due to an extra pancreatic effect. Therefore Menthi possess the advantage of having both pancreatic in diabetic and extra pancreatic in severely diabetic activity.

This example describes studies showing the effect of the fenugreek composition on enzymes of a number of pathways and cellular constituents in various tissues. This example also describes data indicating that treatment with the fenugreek composition reverses abnormal metabolic changes associated with hyperglycemia.

In diabetic and severely diabetic rabbits hexokinase glucokinase in liver and pyruvate kinase were decreased considerably. Treatment of diabetic rabbits with Menthi 50 mg kg day for 15 days and severely diabetic rabbits for 30 days restored the activities of these enzymes to nearly normal except muscle hexokinase which showed a slightly less improvement Table 12 . Malic enzyme which is involved in lipogenesis was reduced in diabetic and severely diabetic animals but after treatment was restored to nearly normal in liver. There was no detectable change in kidney malic enzyme after 15 days treatment although a longer treatment period may produce an improvement. Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase one of the key enzymes of the HMP pathway was also reduced in diabetes and severe diabetes in the liver of rabbits. After Menthi treatment for 15 days there was a partial restoration of the activities indicating that longer treatment will likely completely restore activity to normal levels.

In diabetes and severe diabetes the activity of the key enzyme glucose 6 phosphatase increased. After Menthi treatment there was a considerable decrease Table 13 . Treatment for a longer time period may completely restore the activity of this enzyme to normal.

Two enzymes of polyol pathway sorbitol dehydrogenase and aldose reductase which were elevated both in diabetes and severe diabetes returned to almost normal levels. The improvement was more apparent in the kidney. This finding is important because kidney and the polyol pathway are insensitive to insulin and the products of the polyol pathway are believed to be responsible for the damage to kidney membrane and cataract formation in hyperglycemic patients. Therefore the almost complete return of sorbitol dehydrogenase and aldose reductase to normal levels even in severe diabetes indicates that the composition is useful in ameliorating many of the complications associated with diabetes including complications that are not ameliorated by insulin treatment.

The level of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in liver and kidney of diabetic rabbits with and without treatment by Menthi GII was determined. There was a considerable decrease in the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in diabetic animals. After 15 days treatment the activities of these two enzymes were nearly normal indicating that Menthi treatment restored the antioxidant status of the diabetic rabbits Table 14 . Although no detectable change in glutathione peroxidase activity was detected a longer treatment period likely restores some activity.

This example describes toxicity data in liver and kidney demonstrating that Menthi GII treatment does not have any side effects.

In severely diabetic rabbits treated with Menthi for 30 days the liver and kidney function tests were all within a normal range Table 15 . This indicates that the fenugreek product did not have any adverse side effects.

This example describes the reversal of tissue histopathological changes associated with hyperglycemia after treatment with fenugreek composition.

Fatty changes of varying degrees moderate to severe were observed in the liver tissue of severely diabetic rabbits. For example there was fat infiltration and fatty cyst formation more pronounced in the periportal area. Microscopic examination of parenchymal cell nuclei revealed a vesicular appearance with prominent basophilic nucleoli . After Menthi administration 50 mg kg day to severely diabetic rabbits for one month the above changes showed remarkable improvement and the hepatic tissue appeared histologically normal .

In subdiabetic and diabetic rabbits no changes were observed. In a few diabetic animals vacuolated hepatic parenchymal cells were present and the chromatin was pushed towards one side of the cell . With administration of Menthi GII fraction for 30 days these changes were reversed .

A few severely diabetic rabbits exhibited fatty infiltration of the myocardium which disappeared in the treated group. There were no significant changes observed in the heart in the other diabetic animals.

Histopathological examination of pancreas of the severely diabetic rabbits before treatment revealed heavy fatty infiltration in the exocrine portion of the tissue and the islet cells could not be seen. In the treated group fatty infiltration disappeared and the islet cells became clearly visible in a microsection of pancreas . This finding is consistent with earlier results that there was a 74 improvement in the FPG in the treated SD rabbits and there was improved insulin response by the beta cells.

In the kidneys of the untreated severely diabetic rabbits proliferation of the small blood vessel walls focal areas of inflammation with mononuclear cell infiltrates and fibrosed glomeruli were observed. In several animals hyalinized material was present in the glomeruli and there were areas of calcification in and around the glomeruli and renal tubules . In the treated group of severely diabetic rabbits with the exception of pyelonephritic changes other pathological alterations were no longer observed . Thus Menthi administration arrests the progression of the nephropathy with likely improvement in kidney function.

In the untreated subdiabetic and diabetic group no renal pathology was observed except for one diabetic rabbit in which subcapsular scarring was observed . In the treated group of subdiabetic and diabetic rabbits no abnormal histological changes were observed .

The above studies demonstrate that Menthi treatment either halted the progression or reversed the histopathological abnormalities observed in untreated diabetic rabbits. Furthermore these studies demonstrate that Menthi treatment does not produce abnormal histopathological changes.

Cholesterol was suspended in groundnut oil by a vortex mixer. Each rabbit was given a single dose of 100 mg kg day of cholesterol orally as indicated below.

Animals fed cholesterol 100 mg kg day via gastric intubation with Ryle s tube for one week were randomized into two groups. Group I and II animals each continued to receive cholesterol 100 mg kg day while group II animals also received Menthi GII in addition to cholesterol at a dose of 50 mg kg day for five weeks. This method differs from the conventional method which is to feed rabbits cholesterol until hypercholesterolemia is induced withdraw cholesterol to both control and experimental groups and give the drug to the experimental group. The conventional method suffers from the disadvantage that blood cholesterol level naturally decreases in the untreated control group following cholesterol withdrawal. The effect of a drug with only a slight cholesterol lowering effect would therefore be masked due to the naturally occurring decrease in the control group. The method used herein detects compounds with even a slight cholesterol lowering effect.

Serum total cholesterol TC HDL cholesterol HDLC LDL cholesterol LDLC plus VLDL cholesterol VLDLC and triglycerides were determined every week using kits from Ranbaxy Diagnostics New Delhi Table 16 . Serum cholesterol levels gradually increased in both groups of animals and reached significantly higher levels at the end of the first week. In the untreated group levels increased from 54 7.0 to 123 11.8 mg dl and 59 15 to 114 11.6 mg dl in the group designated for treatment. Similarly the level of LDL VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides increased significantly in both the groups Table 17 . Thus the degree of hypercholesterolemia was the same in both groups before commencement of treatment.

In the control group total cholesterol continued to increase and reached at the end of the fifth week 285 17 mg dl a 428 increase . In contrast in the fenugreek treated test group cholesterol decreased to 97 11 mg dl i.e. a 15 decrease from day 7 value Table 16 . When compared with the day 1 normal values cholesterol increased only 64 compared with a 428 increase in untreated controls. Likewise in the control group there was a marked increase of LDL VLDL from 97 10 mg dl on day 7 to 257 14 mg dl by the end of fifth week whereas in the treated group a marginal rise in cholesterol from 88 10 mg dl at the end of first week to 96 22 mg dl by the end of fifth week occurred Table 17 . Thus the fenugreek composition not only countered the elevating effect of cholesterol feeding on total cholesterol and VLDL LDL cholesterol but also improved the final values. Even the ratios of total cholesterol HDLC and VLDL LDL C HDLC decreased following treatment Table 18 . There was no significant change in HDLC levels in either of the two groups consistent with earlier observations that cholesterol feeding does not significantly effect HDLC levels.

Serum triglyceride levels increased by the end of the first week in both groups. In the following four weeks the increase was only marginal in the treated group in comparison to the untreated control group where the triglycerides levels continued to rise to substantially higher levels Table 19 . This shows that the fenugreek composition prevents increase in serum triglycerides. In both groups no change was observed in the fasting blood glucose levels. This result implies that the hypoglycemic activity of Menthi GII is limited to hyperglycemic states and not in euglycaemic states. This characteristic eliminates the risk of hypoglycemia induced by fenugreek composition which is an advantage over other drugs.

These results demonstrate that serum cholesterol and triglycerides even at significantly high levels can be reduced by administration of fenugreek seed composition. These results also indicate that administration of fenugreek seed composition produces a considerable improvement in all the lipid parameters.

In sum these results demonstrate that the fenugreek composition which showed broad spectrum hypoglycemic activity also has broad spectrum hypolipidemic activity. The insulinotropic activity of the fenugreek composition may mediate the hypoglycemic activity as suggested by the favorable effects on the lipid profile of insulin treatment. Because hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia often develop together the fenugreek composition which exhibits both hypoglycemic and hypocholesterolemic activity has definite advantages.
