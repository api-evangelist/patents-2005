title: Unmanned underwater vehicle tailcone assembly
abstract: A tailcone assembly for an undersea vehicle includes a first tailcone portion having a cavity and a second tailcone portion positionable in and axially extensible from the cavity. An extensible drive shaft is provided for joining the vehicle's engine to a propeller. The extensible drive shaft includes a first drive shaft joined to the engine, and a second drive shaft rotating with the first drive shaft. The second drive shaft is supported by the second tailcone portion and is axially extensible from the first drive shaft upon deployment of the second portion. The propeller is positioned on the second drive shaft outside the second portion. A biasing means is provided between the tailcone portions for deploying the second portion.

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by and for the Government of the United States of America for Governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates to submarine underwater countermeasure assemblies and is directed more particularly to an improved countermeasure vehicle.

In there is shown a typical submarine countermeasure apparatus . The apparatus includes a launch tube which in operation is disposed outboard of the submarine pressure hull not shown . A countermeasure vehicle is housed in the launch tube and includes an array assembly and a tailcone assembly . The array assembly is protected by a surrounding sabot . Disposed in the launch tube is a ram plate and a gas generator . The launch tube is closed by a forward tube cover and an after tube cover .

In operation the gas generator is activated by an electrical pulse from the submarine fire control system and generates sufficient gas pressure to move the ram plate forwardly. The ram plate pushes the countermeasure vehicle forwardly breaking away the forward tube cover and launching the countermeasure vehicle from the launch tube . In short order the sabot disengages from around the array assembly and the array assembly is deployed.

The tail cone assembly includes a propulsion propeller assembly and the countermeasure vehicle houses a motor which drives the propeller assembly to position the countermeasure vehicle in a vertical column of water with the propeller oriented towards the surface.

It has been found that upon launch of the vehicle a combination of a high velocity launch high maneuvering speed of the submarine and strong cross flows on the vehicle hull from launching perpendicular to the submarine hull can subject propeller blades to pressures and bending movements sufficient to damage the propellers and the vehicle tail section. While providing some protection the currently used tailcone assembly is not sufficient to protect the propeller from damage under severe launching conditions. Damaged propellers can affect the ability of the countermeasure to hover at a selected depth in the water column and thereby cause mission failure which places the submarine in a state of increased danger.

Accordingly there is a need for an improved tailcone assembly which can withstand and survive the aforesaid launch conditions and which provides improved propeller protection against severe bending moments.

An object of the invention is therefore to provide an improved submarine countermeasure vehicle tailcone assembly which provides propeller protection during launch and deployment under conditions inflicting high bending moments upon the propeller.

With the above and other objects in view a feature of the present invention is the provision of an unmanned underwater vehicle tailcone assembly. The assembly includes a first portion fixed to the vehicle and forming an after cavity in the vehicle and a second portion disposed within the first portion cavity and slidably moveable therein upon launch of the vehicle to an exposed position extending aft from the vehicle.

The above and other features of the invention including various novel details of construction and combinations of parts will now be more particularly described with reference to the accompanying drawings and pointed out in the claims. It will be understood that the particular assembly embodying the invention is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.

Referring to it will be seen that the tailcone assembly includes a first portion fixed to the vehicle and forming a cavity .

Disposed in the cavity is a tailcone assembly second portion which is slidably moveable in the cavity . Second portion can be prevented from rotating by mating grooves and lands on the interior surface of first portion cavity and the exterior of second portion . The tailcone assembly second portion comprises a reciprocally moveable tailcone on which is mounted the propeller assembly . The propeller assembly includes a propeller shaft and the propeller blades .

The propeller assembly motor is connected to a sealed hollow output drive shaft and is operative to rotatably drive the shaft . The propeller shaft is slidably disposed in the drive shaft . The shafts are configured by using splines or other mating structures such that rotation of the drive shaft is transmitted to the propeller shaft but the propeller shaft is free to move axially in the drive shaft . A bi directional thrust bearing connects the propeller shaft to tailcone second portion .

The tailcone second portion is provided with an annular recess the open end of which faces the tailcone assembly fixed portion and the interior of the vehicle. A coil spring is mounted in the recess extending from an end wall of the annular recess to tailcone assembly fixed portion . An annular ring having a flanged portion is provided against tailcone assembly fixed portion . Annular ring stabilizes spring and assists in assembly. Prior to deployment annular ring extends into annular recess .

Fins extend from the after surface of the tailcone second portion . Outer edges of the fins are in alignment with interior walls of an annular groove in the tailcone fixed portion . An annular stop member is mounted at the after end of the tailcone assembly and extends inwardly to provide an exposed annular surface generally coextensive with an annular end wall of the groove .

At rest in the launch tube the tailcone second portion is in the position shown in wherein the propeller blades are housed within the tailcone assembly cavity . The ram plate is in contact with the after end surface of the tailcone assembly and an end hub mounted on the after end of the propeller shaft . The vehicle hull in is shown as a continuous tailcone without a far aft joint to better withstand large bending moments on the vehicle hull .

Upon activation of the gas generator gas under pressure forces the ram plate to move rapidly toward the forward end of the launch tube . Movement of the ram plate forces movement of the vehicle forward breaking away the forward tube cover and ejecting the vehicle from the launch tube. In the ejection process the tailcone assembly clears the launch tube with the propeller blades shielded from the high bending moments of inrushing water by their disposition in the cavity . When the ram plate reaches the forward end of the launch tube the ram plate is stopped by wedge members not shown inside the launch tube. Prior to separation of the vehicle from ram plate tailcone second portion is held against first portion by ram plate . After separation of the vehicle from the launch tube the spring urges the tailcone second portion rearwardly from the protected position shown in to the extended position shown in . Entry of environmental fluid into tailcone assembly cavity prevents rapid deployment of the tailcone second portion . The second portion stops its rearward movement when the tailcone groove end wall engages the annular surface of the stop member . At that point the propeller blades are exposed to water forces but the violent launch bending moments will have receded. The motor initiates rotation of propeller blades to provide the propulsion power required to properly position the vehicle and its acoustic array.

There is thus provided an improved submarine countermeasure vehicle tailcone assembly which provides protection of the propulsive propeller during launch conditions.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principles and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
