This application claims priority to currently pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60 521 756 entitled Method for Etching Microchannel Networks within Liquid Crystal Polymer Substrates filed Jun. 30 2004.

This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. N00014 98 1 0848 awarded by the Office of Naval Research. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

Channel architectures are almost universally found in complex natural and synthetic systems. Channels existing as waveguides particle guides and circuits and are found in both raised and recessed forms. Although channels can be used for theoretical illustrations such as a channel capacity in an information system channels are practical solutions for efficiently routing physical particles such as electrons ions molecules protons etc. from a source to a destination.

Channels that are reduced in size can be classified as microchannels when they range from 1 m to 1000 m. Within this micro range the physical phenomena of mechanical electrical optical and fluidic circuitry have variable optical size performance and cost features. For example microfluidic circuits below 30 m used for fluid transport on chips and microreactors have significant resistance to flow and require more exacting particle filtration while at the same time only yielding moderate dividends in chip real estate. In addition to the increased flow resistance at sub 30 m dimensions there is an increased cost for finer dimensional control. In contrast electrical circuits yield increased performance with smaller dimensions and warrant the increased cost associated with their manufacture. However even electrical circuits have applications for example in packaging where channel sizes are micron to millimeter in scale.

Prior art methods of forming microchannel patterns for mechanical electrical optical and fluidic circuitry include embossing imprinting soft lithography inkjet and laser direct writing and a variety of photolithography techniques. By far the most popular techniques known in the art have employed some form of photolithography to create highly defined desired microchannel features. However to date most of these photolithographic procedures involve multi step mask and developing steps thus making processing labor intensive and expensive.

Methods are known in the art for using etchants to treat the surface of a polymer substrate. However these methods do not teach or suggest the formation of microchannels or channel like structures that are effective in establishing electrical optical and fluidic circuitry. Surface preparation methods are known in the art utilizing surface etchants in low concentrations as a method of surface roughening to permit subsequent metal lamination in the fabrication process. These methods do not teach or suggest the formation of channels or channel like structures effective in establishing electrical optical and fluidic circuitry. Only minimal roughening of the polymer surface utilizing chemical etchants is achieved by the methods previously known in the art.

Additional methods are known in the art utilizing etchants to form through holes and voids in the substrate for eventual circuit board patterning. These methods do not teach or suggest the use of an etchant system to form complex channels and fluid pathways necessary for the construction of an operational microfluidic device.

The methods known in the art utilizing etchants to produce incidental features in the substrate do not result in the formation of effective grooved patterns and fluid conduits in the substrate that are continuous patterns that can be used in the subsequent formation of microfluidic devices. Although the vias and holes are formed using masking techniques known in the art these methods do not teach or suggest a method for connecting these features together in a continuous pattern necessary to provide fluid transport.

While various means for the etching of polymer surfaces are known in the art the current state of the art does not teach or suggest the formation of complex channel structures and other fluidic canals necessary to fabricate microfluidic devices. In contrast the techniques known the art describe the formation of rough surfaces for further treatment or formation of holes through the polymer substrate. In addition all of these features are intermediate in nature and provide little function and do not contribute to the development of a functional pathway for the fabrication of micofluidic devices.

Accordingly what is needed in the art is a method for the direct patterning of channels in different photoreactive materials using an electronic mask to create a variety of electrical and photonic circuits mechanical acoustic waveguides RF waveguides and gas or liquid flow channels.

The method in accordance with the present invention provides a process for etching of microchannels in a liquid crystal polymer layer of a printed circuit board. The microchannels produced in accordance with this method are effective in the transport of fluids within the printed circuit board polymer layer. In general the present invention discloses a method for fabricating patterns and networks of microchannels in three dimensions for transport of fluids or mass and additionally for mass or material containment.

The present invention relates to the field of the creation of microchannels and more particularly to the fabrication of microchannels for use in Microelectromechanical MEMS devices and MEMS related devices. In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention microchannels are formed by a microfabrication method utilizing electronic imaging techniques in combination with chemical etching and subsequent metallization. The method of the present invention is effective in producing networks of channels in liquid crystal polymer LCP polymeric substrates which are highly defined in terms of their patterns and thus are able to encompass a wide variety of end uses.

In an additional embodiment the copper layer may be removed from the substrate and the liquid crystal polymer layer may be catalyzed and electroplated.

The present invention is related to a process for the creation of mask based or preferably mask free structures on planar and curved surfaces which is useful when applied to a variety of materials including metals ceramics organic polymers and semiconductors.
