The present invention relates to an event ordering certification technology for certifying an occurrence order of events accompanied with generation of digital data.

The event ordering certification technology contains a technology for certifying the occurrence order of a plurality of events accompanied with generation of digital data and a technology for certifying contents of the digital data generated by the events.

With activisation of Web based commerce on the Internet and magnified availability in managing digital documents in recent years there is required a mechanism of electronic authentication for a third party to certify who and when the digital data was generated and or communicated and what the digital data was formed by. The electronic authentication includes various functions of specifying transmitter receiver of the digital data confirming arrival of the data certifying context of digital documents such as transmission reception detecting a tamper storing electronic documents and so on. The event ordering certification technology accomplishes the functions of certifying the context of digital documents and detecting the tamper.

As for this event ordering certification system adopting the digital signature as a main base for authenticity of this event ordering receipt there are pointed out various problems in view of falseness in the event ordering certification apparatus term of validity of the event ordering receipt aspects of system operation and so on. Therefore there is also proposed an event ordering certification method that does not adopt the digital signature as the main base for authenticity of this event ordering receipt. For instance a method with Linear Linking Protocol is disclosed in nonpatent literatures No. 1 S. Haber and W. Stornetta How to Time Stamp a Digital Document Journal of Crytology Vol. 3 No. 2 pp 99 111 1991 and No. 2 J. J. Quisquater H. Massias J. S. Avila B. Van Rompay Specification and implementation of a timstamping System Technical Report of Universite Cathoilique de Louvain 1999 URL www dice.ucl.ac.be crpto TIMESEC TR4.tgzl . With this method with Linear Linking Protocol it is possible to provide the system as a whole with high safety even if the event ordering certification apparatus is not reliable. is a diagram to explain an event ordering certification system by Linear Linking Protocol that does not rely upon PKI. In the event ordering certification system is constructed so as to produce a link information Lcorrelating a plurality of users data hash values objective of event ordering certification with each other and send event ordering receipts including the link information Lto the users . Each of the event ordering receipts is adapted so as to depend on all of the event ordering receipts that have been produced previously. Then as parts L L of the link information are published on mass media e.g. newspapers periodically it is possible to prevent falseness of the event ordering certification apparatus whereby the reliability of the whole system can be improved.

However the above mentioned method of Linear Linking Protocol requires mutual collaboration among the users in order to detect the falseness of the event ordering certification apparatus . Additionally in order to allow the users to verify the obtained event ordering receipts and verify that the published information is related to the event ordering receipts in an orderly manner the users are required to gobble down great volume of data from the event ordering certification apparatus .

Methods for solving part of the above mentioned problems partially are also proposed. For example in nonpatent literatures No. 3 A. Buldas P. Land H Lipmaa and J. Villemson Time stamping with binary linking schemes in Processings of Advances on Cryptology CRYPTO 98 ed. H. Krawczyk pp. 486 501 Springer Verlag 1998 and No. 4 A. Buldas H Lipmaa and B. Schoenmakers Optimally efficient accountable time stamping in Proceedings of Public Key Crytography 2000 PKC2000 eds. Y Zheng and H. Imai pp. 293 305 Springer Verlag January 2000 there is proposed a method of adopting a tree structure in place of the linear lists used in the nonpatent literatures Nos. 1 and 2 in order to calculate publication data collecting up event ordering requests processed by an event ordering certification apparatus for a certain period thereby remarkably reducing the amount of data required for the user to verify an event ordering receipt from the amount of data proportional to the number of event ordering requests accepted for the certain period to the amount of data proportional to a logarithm base 2 of the former amount.

In the above mentioned method described in the nonpatent literatures Nos. 3 and 4 however there are problems as follows.

Assuming that two different users send their respective event ordering requests to an event ordering certification apparatus and subsequently these event ordering requests are accepted by the event ordering certification apparatus it is impossible to provide evidence that the acceptance of one event ordering request by the first user has been carried out before the acceptance of another event ordering request by the second user unless the publication data collecting up the event ordering requests is published with a completion of the above certain period. Thus the above method is inferior to users convenience against the event ordering certification system. Additionally if the event ordering certification apparatus has a malfunction then it becomes impossible for the users to verify the event ordering receipts.

In order to solve the above mentioned problem an object of the present invention is to provide in an event ordering certification system for certifying an event ordering with the use of a tree structure an event ordering certification method an event ordering certification audit method certification and audit apparatuses in an event ordering certification system and programs for event ordering certification event ordering certification audit validation of event ordering certificates and validation of event times all of which can verify event ordering receipts published by an event ordering certification organization without using publication data collecting up event ordering requests.

The certification apparatus comprises a transmitting receiving part for transmitting and receiving data to and from the user apparatuses and the audit apparatus through the computer network an event ordering request aggregation part for arranging digital data as event ordering requests transmitted from the user apparatuses with the use of a sequential aggregation tree an audit information drafting part for drafting audit information to be transmitted to the audit apparatus a complementary data acquiring part for acquiring complementary data in response to complementary data requests from the user apparatuses a digital signature drafting part for attaching attach a high intensity digital signature to data where respective contents of plural receipts issued by the certification apparatus for a constant period are associated with each other an electronic information publishing part for giving publicity to the data having the high intensity digital signature and a memory part for memorizing the receipts and information about the event ordering certification.

As mentioned above the event ordering request aggregation part operates to aggregate the event ordering requests with the use of the sequential aggregation tree. This sequential aggregation tree will be described with reference to . The sequential aggregation tree of is a sequential aggregation tree that is completed for a certain period e.g. one week a cycle for the ordering apparatus to give publicity to coordinating data which will be referred to as sequential aggregation period . In the sequential aggregation tree digital data produced from all or part of digital data included in the event ordering requests from the users apparatuses in accordance with a designated sequentially assigned data calculating procedure is sequentially assigned to respective leaves from the left side with time note the assigned digital data will be referred to as sequentially assigned data item for example a hash value of the digital data included in the event ordering request .

A calculating method of values assigned to respective nodes except leaf in the sequential aggregation tree is as follows. An assigned value of a parent in the sequential aggregation tree is obtained by calculating a hash value as a result of connecting an assigned value H of a left side child with an assigned value H of a right side child conjunction between a bit row and a bit row and further applying a designated collision resistant one way hash function. Here the resultant value is expressed by h H H . In this way it is performed to calculate an assigned value at high level by assigned values at low level and finally calculate an assigned value root value at the highest level root .

We now describe an example of a sequential aggregation tree having sixteen leaves as shown in . The number of leaves of the sequential aggregation tree and its height do not become definite unless the sequential aggregation period is completed. Further in the sequential aggregation tree the assignment of values to the leaves is carried out from left in sequence. The assignments of values to nodes higher than level i.e. non leaves are carried out incrementally if possible. Accordingly for a plurality of nodes on the same vertical line of the assignments of values to the nodes are carried out at about the same time in the same processing unit. Under the notation that a node at level j and numbered index i is represented by j i and an assigned value of j i is represented by V j i the concrete example of will be described.

Suppose a situation that sequential assigned data is assigned to node in other words a hash value to be assigned to a certain sequential aggregation tree leaf is represented by V . Then in order to calculate a root value H V from this hash value V it has only to link V to V from the left side thereby calculating a hash value h V to the hash value h from the right side thereby calculating a hash value h V to the hash value h from the left side thereby calculating a hash value h and link V to the hash value h from the right side thereby calculating a hash value H V in order. With the above procedure when it becomes possible to calculate the root value H from V and its complementary data e.g. V V V V in this case we can say V links with the root value H through the hash function h . Additionally the complementary data of V in the sequential aggregation tree referred to as sequentially aggregated complementary data is given by

The event ordering reply drafting part drafts a certification reply containing a receipt EOC y as shown in and sends it to the user apparatus . The receipt EOC y is constructed so as to contain digital data y sent from a user sequentially assigned data item z calculated from the digital data y by the above mentioned calculation procedure for sequentially assigned data item a sequential aggregation tree number enabling a sequential aggregation tree having the data item z assigned to be identified uniquely a sequential aggregation tree leaf number enabling a sequential aggregation tree leaf having the data item z assigned to be identified uniquely and a part HK of sequentially aggregated complementary data acquirable at that time. The above data part HK will be referred to as immediate complementary data . In the modification the receipt EOC y may be constructed on deletion of the immediate complementary data HK.

The event receipt EOC y is allowed to be sent with a digital signature using a secret key secret key for signature of a public key cryptosystem key pair that the certification apparatus prepares in advance. In this case it is established that the user apparatus has access to a public key of the public key cryptosystem key pair by means of a public key cryptography board or the like.

Note that sequential aggregation complementary data acquirable after publishing a receipt EOC y in question will be referred to as late complementary data . That is at that stage of drafting the receipt EOC y only the immediate complementary data is transmitted to the user apparatus while the late complementary data is transmitted to the user apparatus when it is required after publishing the receipt EOC y in question. In for instance node assigned values V and V constitute the immediate complementary data about node while node assigned values V and V constitute the late complementary data acquirable on and after node has been assigned. For a sequential aggregation tree leaf number i V i may be represented by V i in short.

In operation when the complementary data acquiring part receives a request for the above mentioned late complementary data from the user apparatus the part sends back all of the information at the present moment i.e. tree number and leaf number to which the relevant request is assigned and the sequential aggregation complementary data positional information assigned value which has been already determined at this moment to the user apparatus

Referring to the contents of the sequential aggregation complementary data will be described in detail.

As for one leaf of the sequential aggregation tree its complementary data CToken t t at another leaf t positioned on the right of the leaf t will be defined as follows.

A path extending from the leaf up to a root of the sequential aggregation tree is called root path of t . Further a row of nodes consisting of brotherly nodes for nodes belonging to the above root path of t but the root itself is called authentication path of t . Note that a detailed definition of the authentication path will be described later. In respective constituents nodes of an authentication path a row of constituents whose assigned values have already become definite at the point of the establishment of an assigned value for a leaf t on the right of t will be referred to as authPathD t t and also called authentication path for t at t hereinafter. In connection one resulting from adding the information about assigned values to the above row of constituents will be referred to as authPathDV t t and also called valued authentication path for t at t hereinafter.

From above it will be understood that authPathDV t t constitutes the complementary data CToken t t while involving even information that the receipt EOC y does not involve.

Even when t is one leaf of a next sequential aggregation tree SBT produced after completing a generative period i.e. sequential aggregation period of the preceding sequential aggregation tree SBT containing t authPathDV t t involves only the information about the tree SBT. At this time CToken t t in combination with the receipt EOC y contains information enough to calculate the root value of the sequential aggregation tree for the relevant sequential aggregation period.

In for instance CToken t t contains one row composed of a first pair of positional information of a and its assigned value pair V a and a second pair of positional information of a and its assigned value pair V a . The row is represented by V a V a .

In the following descriptions we define complementary data that allows a root value of a sequential aggregation tree to be calculated in combination with an assigned value of the sequential aggregation tree contained in a receipt as complete complementary data of the receipt . In connection we refer to complementary data that would allow the root value of the sequential aggregation tree to be calculated in combination with the assigned value and the immediate complementary data contained in the receipt as complete late complementary data .

The audit information drafting part acquires audit information from the sequential aggregation tree and sends it to the audit apparatus . More in detail the audit information is formed by an event ordering receipt certificate for audit which is produced at an audit point in the sequential aggregation tree as follows. Note that the terminology event ordering receipt certificate for audit will be referred to as audit receipt below. Here the audit point designates a leaf in a sequential aggregation binary tree that an event ordering request for audit from the audit apparatus is assigned. Note that the terminology event ordering request for audit will be referred to as audit request below.

Although a single audit point is shown in it is a matter of course that there may be provided some audit points in accordance with a designated algorithm. For the purpose of a later mentioned audit against a receipt for an event ordering request the audit point may be positioned in anyplace so long as it coincides with one leaf e.g. node in corresponding to the event ordering request or another leaf on the right temporally behind .

The format of an audit receipt is identical to that of a receipt to be sent to the user apparatus . Note that digital data y as a basis of calculating a sequentially assigned data item may be data that was sent from the audit apparatus to the certification apparatus as an audit request. Alternatively the digital data y may be produced by the relevant certification apparatus in accordance with a predetermined procedure for the audit apparatus in question. Additionally on the assumption of drafting a digital document as an object of event ordering certification in the audit receipt in accordance with a predetermined procedure a hash value as a result of applying a predetermined hash function on the digital document may be adopt as the digital data for calculating the sequentially assigned data item.

The user apparatus comprises a transmitting receiving part for transferring data to and from the certification apparatus and the audit apparatus through the computer network an event ordering certification requesting part for performing the event ordering requests containing designated digital data a complementary data requesting part for requesting complementary data for a receipt receipt certificate acquirable at the point of requesting an event ordering certification verifying part for verifying the receipt and a memory part for storing the information about event ordering certification containing the receipt.

Here it is noted that the event ordering certification verifying part has the following validation functions for the receipt.

First the event ordering certification verifying part has the zeroth 0. validation function to perform a digital signature validation to a digital signature if it is included in the receipt.

As the first validation function it is performed to verify whether the sequentially assigned data item contained in the receipt is linked with the public information published with assured authenticity such as high intensity digital signature by the certification apparatus .

As described below the event ordering certification verifying part has the second function of verifying the validity of the receipt by using the audit apparatus even before publishing the public information from the certification apparatus .

The audit apparatus comprises a transmitting receiving part for transferring data to and from the certification apparatus and the user apparatuses through the computer network an event ordering certification audit part that verifies a receipt by using both audit request information from the user apparatus and part s own audit information when receiving an audit request for the receipt from the user apparatus and sends a result of validation to the user apparatus and a memory part for storing audit information including the audit receipt.

Here we now describe the function of the event ordering certification audit part with reference to . In because of an audit point the audit information that the audit apparatus receives at this point of time comprises V and V as mentioned above. On the other hand the user apparatus sends as the audit request information V and V V and V as the sequential aggregation complementary data. Regarding the incorporation of V into the audit request information it is noted that it becomes possible for the user apparatus to acquire V not included in the immediate complementary data from the certification apparatus at the point of requesting the validation i.e. on and after the audit point temporally behind the issue of the point and therefore the user apparatus actually acquires V as the late complementary data from the certification apparatus and incorporates it into the audit request information. In this way the event ordering certification audit part verifies whether its own audit information V coincides with V introduced by the audit request information from the user apparatus

Hereinafter a sequential aggregation tree leaf to which a sequentially assigned data item drafted by an event ordering request from the user apparatus is assigned will be referred to as user point while a sequential aggregation tree leaf to which a sequentially assigned data item drafted by an audit request from the audit apparatus is assigned will be referred to as audit point .

We refer to a node in in the sequential aggregation tree to be verified comparatively as authentication point after. Generally when a certain user point number is smaller than an audit point number a label assigned value for the authentication point is included in the audit information. Further the label for the authentication point is included in a label calculable from the late complementary data that the user apparatus could receive on and after the point of completing an event ordering certification process at the audit point. In a sequential aggregation tree therefore if there are sequentially arranged a user point an audit point and a request point for late complementary data in order from left the above mentioned validation could be accomplished constantly. This reason of accomplishment will be described later see later mentioned Feature 2 of Sequential Aggregation Tree Item 3 .

In order for the user apparatus to ask the audit apparatus to perform the second validation for a certain receipt an audit point of the audit apparatus has to be present between one leaf where an event ordering request for the above receipt is assigned and another leaf where a request of late complementary data for the above receipt is assigned including also leaves .

Note that the above apparatuses are formed by electronic apparatuses each having a CPU Central Processing Unit having at least a calculating function and a control function a main memory having a function to store programs and data such as RAM Random Access Memory and a secondary memory capable of continuing to memorize data even at powered off such as HD Hard Disc . The operations of respective parts of the certification apparatus i.e. the event ordering request aggregating part the event ordering drafting part the audit information drafting part the complementary data acquiring part the digital signature drafting part and the electronic information publishing part the operations of respective parts of the user apparatus i.e. the event ordering requesting part the complementary data requesting part and the event ordering verifying part and the operation of the event ordering certification audit part of the audit apparatus are nothing but respective crystallizations of the above calculating control functions of the above central processing unit. Additionally the memory part of the certification apparatus the memory part of the user apparatus and the memory part of the audit apparatus are respectively equipped with the above mentioned functions of either the main memory or the secondary memory.

Each program for executing a variety of processes in this embodiment is stored in either the main memory or the secondary memory mentioned above. In connection this program may be recorded in a computer readable recording medium e.g. hard disc flexible disc CD ROM MO DVD ROM etc. or delivered through a communication network.

In the event ordering certification system constructed above an event ordering certification method and an event ordering certification validation method will be described with reference to . In the figures is a sequence diagram to explain the operation of the certification apparatus to draft a receipt i.e. a receiving certificate and an audit receipt i.e. a receiving certificate for audit for one sequential aggregation period. is a flow chart to explain the operation of the user apparatus to apply a first validation on the receipt. is a sequence diagram to explain the operation of the user apparatus to apply a second validation on the receipt.

When the user apparatus sends an event ordering request including digital data to the event ordering certification apparatus it receives the event ordering request including the digital data y through the transmitting receiving part steps S S .

Next the event ordering request aggregation part calculates a sequentially assigned data item z from the digital data y as partial or all input and further assigns the sequentially assigned data item z to a sequential aggregation tree leaf to construct a sequential aggregation tree incrementally. While the event ordering certification drafting part drafts a receipt EOC y and successively sends it to the user apparatus through the transmitting receiving part steps S S S .

In this way the user apparatus can acquire the receipt EOC y step S . In connection the user apparatus may incorporate immediate complementary data acquirable at that time into the receipt EOC y . However it should be noted that the receipt EOC y does not include the late complementary data.

In the same way when the audit apparatus sends an audit event ordering request the event ordering certification apparatus receives the audit event ordering request including through the transmitting receiving part steps S S .

Next the event ordering request aggregation part assigns a sequentially assigned data item for audit calculated by the audit event ordering request to a sequential aggregation tree leaf to construct a sequential aggregation tree incrementally. While the audit information drafting part drafts a receipt certificate for audit referred to as audit receipt after and successively sends it to the audit apparatus through the transmitting receiving part steps S S S .

Next when the user apparatus sends a request of late complementary data for the obtained receipt to the event ordering certification apparatus it receives the request of late complementary data through the transmitting receiving part steps S S .

Then the complementary data acquiring part of the certification apparatus acquires complementary data for the receipt which can be acquired at that time and further sends this late complementary data to the user apparatus through the transmitting receiving part steps S S .

The above mentioned operation of the certification apparatus is repeated in a certain period for sequential aggregation i.e. sequential aggregation period . When the sequential aggregation period is completed a root value in the sequential aggregation tree is calculated. Then the electronic information publishing part gives publicity to the root value steps S S S . In connection in view of assuring the authenticity of the information the electronic information publishing part may disclose published information having a high intensity digital signature with the use of the high intensity digital signature drafting part .

According to the event ordering certification method of the audit apparatus transmits the request of audit information to the certification apparatus and correspondingly it transmits the audit information to the audit apparatus . Alternatively the certification apparatus may send the audit information to the audit apparatus automatically.

Referring to we now describe a method for validation of event ordering certificates utilizing the published information disclosed electronically. This corresponds to the first validation function of the user apparatus .

First the user apparatus calculates a root value Rhcal in the sequential aggregation tree by the digital data y as the request of certification that the apparatus has sent to the certification apparatus the receipt EOC y the sequential aggregation complementary data included in the late complementary data note At this point all sequential aggregation complementary data can be acquired step S .

Next it is executed to acquire a root value RH for the same sequential aggregation period published with the high intensity digital signature electronically and further it is executed to judge whether this root value RH is identical to the calculated root value Rhcal steps S S .

If the above validation is completed in success then it is possible to confirm that the receipt is not subjected to tamper step S . On the other hand if the above validation is failed it is possible to confirm that the receipt is subjected to tamper step S . Consequently after the information is published electronically while ensuring the authenticity by means of the high intensity digital signature it is possible to verify that the receipt published by the certification apparatus is one which has been issued during said sequential aggregation period in an order distinguishable with a sequential aggregation tree leaf number included in the receipt against original data included in the receipt.

Referring to we now describe the method for validation of event ordering certificates using the audit apparatus . This corresponds to the second validation function of the user apparatus

Before an audit request the user apparatus requests late complementary data of a receipt objective of validation for the certification apparatus step S . When the certification apparatus receives this request through the transmitting receiving part complementary data acquiring part acquires either the late complementary data obtained by subtracting instant complementary data from all of the late complementary data acquirable at that time case the instant complementary data is included in the receipt or all of the late complementary data acquirable at that time case no instant complementary data is included in the receipt and successively the part sends the so acquired late complementary data to the user apparatus through the transmitting receiving part steps S S S . With this acquirement of the complementary data by the user apparatus the event ordering certification verifying part sends audit request information including the receipts received in advance to the audit apparatus steps S S .

The audit apparatus receives the audit request information through the transmitting receiving part step S . In respective leaves of a sequential aggregation tree where audit receipts on previous reception are assigned the event ordering certification audit part calculates an audit point a between a sequential aggregation tree leaf that the receipt in the above audit request information on this reception is assigned and a leaf included in the late complementary information step S . Next the audit apparatus calculates a certification point for the leaf by the audit point from the audit request information and further calculates an assigned value Acal for the so calculated certification point step S . On the other hand the event ordering certification audit part acquires an assigned value A of this certification point that the apparatus has already acquired as the audit information from the memory part and judges whether the assigned value A of the certification point coincides with the assigned value Acal of the certification point on calculation steps S S .

If the above validation is completed in success then it is possible to confirm that the receipt is not subjected to tamper step S . On the other hand if the above validation is failed it is possible to confirm that the receipt is subjected to tamper step S . The event ordering certification audit part sends this audit result to the user apparatus through the transmitting receiving part while the user apparatus receives the audit result step S S .

Consequently even before publication an electronic publishing organization each user apparatus can absolutely verify that the receipt published by the certification apparatus is one that was issued during said sequential aggregation period in an order distinguishable with a sequential aggregation tree leaf number included in the receipt against original data included in the receipt. Note that the above audit result may contain an identifier of the audit point . In this case the user apparatus can obtain an assurance that the registration of an event ordering request corresponding to the receipt requiring the above audit was carried out before the registration of an audit event ordering request corresponding to the audit point from the audit apparatus .

Note that in the process at step S it may be carried out for the audit apparatus to attach a digital signature to the information containing the complementary data that the audit apparatus has received with the use of a signature secret key of the certification audit apparatus . Then the result of validation with the digital signature is transmitted to the user apparatus . Consequently even if an effective digital signature is not available for the root value of the sequential aggregation tree on the presupposition that the digital signature by the audit apparatus is credible it becomes possible for a user using the user apparatus to certify the validity of event ordering certification using the above receipt against a third person objectively.

Next we describe the second validation that is a validation method of event ordering certification using the audit apparatus in detail.

Note that the following description is based on the premise that a point of time of starting the service of the event ordering certification system coincides with an origin of time one parameter e.g. one second one milli second etc. is established as a clocking unit and a time point is represented by an integral number as a result of clocking a passage of time since the above origin of time by the above clocking unit.

Here some preliminary definitions are given to explain the validation method of event ordering certification.

In a sequential aggregation tree SBT one node is identified by its level j and its in level number i. As for this node p its level and number are expressed by level p and index p respectively.

Additionally leaf SBT i represents a leaf in the sequential aggregation tree SBT which is identified with the leaf number i in the sequential aggregation tree. A series of processes of accepting an event ordering request forming the origin of assigning assigned values to the leaf SBT i sequentially and further assigning an assigned value to the same leaf will be referred to as processing round and represented by round SBT i . When it is obvious from the context that which of sequential aggregation tress is being discussed now they may be represented by leaf i and round i simply.

Identification numbers starting from zero are applied to sequential aggregation trees in order of generation. This number will be referred to as sequential aggregation tree number hereinafter. The number of leaves in an nsequential aggregation tree will be represented by N n .

Both sequential aggregation tree number n and sequential aggregation tree leaf number i are given to each receipt. Thus a sequential aggregation tree leaf having the receipt issued can be designated with these two numbers in pairs. The order between two extended leaf identifiers n i and n i is defined with the use of lexicographic order. That is 

Additionally as for a leaf SBT i in a sequential aggregation tree SBT in question the receipt time of an event ordering request forming the origin of assigning assigned values to respective leaves of the above sequential aggregation tree SBT will be referred to as time corresponding to the leaf and represented by time SBT i or time i simply. Similarly as for the leaf the receipt time of an event ordering request forming the origin of assigning an assigned value to this leaf is represented by time .

In order to allow the user apparatus to perform the second validation against one receipt with the use of the audit apparatus the audit point of the audit apparatus has to be present between a sequential aggregation tree leaf corresponding to the receipt and another sequential aggregation tree leaf corresponding to a request of late complementary data for the receipt as mentioned above also including leaves and . For this purpose it is good enough if three following conditions 1 to 3 for a positive integer are fulfilled 

 2 Let one optional audit point by the audit apparatus and the next point be and respectively. Then time time is satisfied.

 3 Assume that after receiving a receipt by a sequential aggregation tree leaf of the extended leaf identifier the user apparatus receives the late complementary data for the receipt at a certain sequential aggregation tree leaf . Then time time is satisfied.

Note that the reason for sufficiency of these conditions will be described later see items 1 and 2 in Feature 3 of Next Aggregation Tree mentioned later .

It is assumed that the audit apparatus receives an audit receipt at an audit point belonging to a certain sequential aggregation tree shown in . Then the audit receipt contains instant complementary data at the audit point . In spite of positioning on the left side of the audit point in an optional leaf in the sequential aggregation tree SBT the above instant complementary data incorporates an assigned value V in the following sense. Thus an assigned value V p of a certification point p for by is included in the above instant complementary data. This assigned value at the certification point can be calculated by starting from V and linking assigned values of some nodes belonging to an authPath with each other be means of hash function reason for establishment see item 1 in Feature 2 of Sequential Aggregation Tree mentioned later .

Consequently by judging whether the above value V p is included in the instant complementary data in the audit receipt received at the audit point it is possible to verify that both transmission of a request underlying the receipt acquired at the user point by a user and acceptance of the request by the certification apparatus are in advance of the reception of the audit receipt by the audit apparatus at the audit point referred to as validation result No. . See .

Here we now describe serialisablity of the certification apparatus . The serialisablity of the certification apparatus is defined as a situation that in case of a plurality of event ordering requests the certification apparatus sequentially accepts these requests in accordance with a certain ordering for arranging a plurality of requests in series and sequentially sends receipts in response to these requests in accordance with the certain ordering.

The serialisablity of the certification apparatus is an important requirement. According to this embodiment the certification apparatus is provided with means for ensuring serialisablity. In detail the means for ensuring serialisablity may be formed by a serialisablity audit apparatus that is constructed so as to monitor a situation where if the certification apparatus accepts a single event ordering request then the apparatus firstly sends a receipt for this event ordering request and subsequently the apparatus accepts a next request.

If adopting the serialisablity then it is possible to form a conclusion that the ordering relationship between the user point and the audit point is stronger than that of the validation result No. . Provided that the serialisablity of the certification apparatus is ensured until the reception of the receipt by the apparatus at the audit point for instance it is possible to form a conclusion that the acceptance of the event ordering request corresponding to the user point has been carried out previously to the acceptance of the audit event ordering request corresponding to the audit point owing to the above validation referred to as varidation result No. . See . This reason is as follows. Let s say that in the serialized process of event ordering requests the acceptance of the audit event ordering request corresponding to the audit point has been carried out previously to the acceptance of the event ordering request corresponding to the user point . In this case it means that the receipt EOC for the point is transmitted previously to the acceptance of the audit receipt EOC for the point so that it becomes impossible to allow the receipt EOC to include data that an event value included in the EOC is incorporated through the hash function. From above when expecting the serialisablity of the certification apparatus until the reception of the audit receipt by the audit apparatus at the audit point it can be presumed that the acceptance of the event ordering request corresponding to the user point was carried out previously to the acceptance of the audit event ordering request corresponding to the audit point . Hereinafter this operation will be referred to as future bounding of user point .

It should be noted that the above argument couldn t be effected unless the audit apparatus receives the instant complementary data forming the receipt in part despite that the serialisablity of the certification apparatus is ensured until the reception of the audit receipt by the apparatus at the audit point . Because it is impossible to eliminate a possibility that the certification apparatus changes an assigned value at T after the reception of the audit receipt by the apparatus at the audit point .

According to the event ordering certification system of the first embodiment when accepting an event ordering request from the user apparatus the certification apparatus operates to publish a receipt incl. a sequential assigned value calculated from the digital data in the event ordering request positional information of a sequential aggregation tree where the sequentially assigned data item is assigned and its complementary data and additionally the apparatus publishes the information electronically while ensuring the authenticity for instance by means of attaching a high intensity digital signature to a root value forming a sequential aggregation tree for complementary information. Therefore the user apparatus can verify the receipt from the published information and the complementary data with ease. In addition even before electronically publishing the root value in the sequential aggregation tree the audit apparatus can audit the receipt on acceptance of an audit request from the user apparatus since the same apparatus possesses the audit information about an audit point in the sequential aggregation tree.

As a result when the legality of the receipt can be validated then it is possible to certify that the operation of the apparatus to receive the event ordering request for a receipt objective of audit was carried out before the operation to receive the event ordering request for an audit receipt used in the audit.

The system structure of the second embodiment is similar to that of the first embodiment. The second embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that after completing each of sequential aggregation periods or based on a pre contract the audit apparatus requests completed late complementary data for each audit receipt which has been acquired for the sequential aggregation period to the certification apparatus and subsequently the audit apparatus acquires the completed late complementary data from the apparatus . Note that in this embodiment constitutions and functions different from those of the first embodiment will be described. Regarding the other constitutions and functions their descriptions are eliminated while elements identical to those of the first embodiment are indicated with the same reference numerals respectively.

Similarly to the first embodiment the system architecture of the event ordering certification system is not limited to this only and therefore it may be modified to various forms so long as its identity in function. For instance as shown in event ordering certification user validation apparatuses referred to as user validation apparatuses below i a b . . . n may verify the receipts in place of the user apparatuses . Additionally in place of the certification apparatus the electronic information publication apparatus of may obtain published data from the certification apparatus and release the published data to the public. Moreover the computer network may be replaced by other communicating means such as postal mail.

The certification apparatus comprises the transmitting receiving part for transmitting and receiving data to and from the user apparatuses and the audit apparatus through the computer network the event ordering request aggregation part for arranging digital data transmitted from the user apparatuses with the use of a sequential aggregation tree an audit information drafting part for drafting audit information to be transmitted to the audit apparatus the complementary data acquiring part for acquiring complementary data in response to complementary data requests from the user apparatuses the digital signature drafting part for attaching attach a high intensity digital signature to data where respective contents of plural receipts issued by the certification apparatus for a constant period are associated with each other the electronic information publishing part for giving publicity to the data having the high intensity digital signature and a memory part for memorizing the receipts and information about the event ordering certification.

The audit information drafting part drafts not only the audit receipts at the respective audit points through the sequential aggregation tree but also the completed late complementary data of the respective audit receipts acquired for the sequential aggregation period.

The audit apparatus comprises the transmitting receiving part for transmitting and receiving data to and from the certification apparatus and the user apparatuses through the computer network a complementary data requesting part for requesting the completed late complementary data of each audit receipt to the certification apparatus an event ordering certification audit part and a memory part . In detail when receiving an audit request for one receipt from the user apparatus the event ordering certification audit part verifies the receipt with the use of the audit respect information transmitted from the user apparatus and the audit information incl. the audit receipt and its completed late complementary data and subsequently sends the audit result to the user apparatus . Note that the memory part stores the audit information including the receipt certificate for audit i.e. audit receipt .

In addition to the function of the event ordering certification audit part of the first embodiment i.e. future bounding of user point the event ordering certification audit part has a function of past bounding of user point mentioned later. This means that the same part is capable of auditing not only the positioning of a certain user point on the left side of one audit point namely former positioning with time but the positioning of a certain user point on the right side of one audit point namely later positioning with time .

In the following descriptions the above mentioned operation of the audit apparatus to acquire after completing each sequential aggregation period the completed late complementary data for each of audit receipts that the apparatus acquired in the relevant sequential aggregation period will be referred to as the audit apparatus carries out combined complete complement .

In this embodiment as the audit apparatus acquires the completed late complementary data for the audit receipts received for the sequential aggregation period with respect to each completion of the sequential aggregation periods this combining of the instant complementary data included in the audit receipts with the late complementary data allows the audit apparatus to acquire full complementary data for the audit event receipts received for the sequential aggregation period.

Suppose that the user apparatus and the audit apparatus satisfy with the conditions 1 to 3 mentioned in the first embodiment. Let be a user point by the user apparatus . Suppose that T time is satisfied. Under this condition T time by the above condition 1 there exist audit points by the audit apparatus on the left side namely former positioning with time of . Let one of such audit points be . Alternatively may be defined as being a rightmost one of audit points satisfying with the above conditions. The audit will be carried out in accordance with the following procedure.

 1 The user apparatus sends the receipt sequential aggregation tree number instant complementary data acquired at the user point to the audit apparatus .

 2 The audit apparatus picks up the sequential aggregation tree number from the receipt sent from the user apparatus specifies a sequential aggregation tree leaf corresponding to the receipt and selects an audit receipt which corresponds to one sequential aggregation tree leaf positioned on the left of the leaf from the audit receipts that the apparatus has acquired. In the audit receipts on the left of the leaf alternatively there may be selected an audit receipt whose corresponding sequential aggregation tree leaf is positioned on the rightmost side. This sequential aggregation tree leaf corresponding to such a selected audit receipt will be called .

 3 Performing the above mentioned combined complete complement the audit apparatus acquires completed late complementary data of an audit receipt corresponding to the audit point . A sequential aggregation tree leaf corresponding to the completed late complementary data is identical to the leaf or positioned on the right of the leaf namely later positioning with time .

 4 By the audit receipt corresponding to the audit point and the corresponding late complementary data the audit apparatus can calculate an assigned value of a validation point p by the user point of the audit point .

 5 Therefore the audit apparatus can audit that the point is positioned on the left of the point by verifying the calculated assigned value of the validation point p by the user point of the audit point is included in the instant complementary data in the receipt corresponding to the sequential aggregation tree leaf which was sent from the user apparatus

All one can firstly say from this validation result is as follows. Let t t and t denote a time when the audit event ordering request of the audit apparatus corresponding to the audit point is received by the certification apparatus a time when the event ordering request of the user apparatus corresponding to the user point is received by the certification apparatus and a time when the receipt against the event ordering request is transmitted from the certification apparatus respectively. Then the inequality t

It is noted that the serialisablity of the certification apparatus is ensured in this embodiment as well. That is assuming that the serialisablity of the certification apparatus is ensured until the point of time t there could be concluded another inequality t

It should be noted that the above argument couldn t be effected unless the user apparatus receives the instant complementary data forming the receipt despite that the serialisablity of the certification apparatus is ensured until the time t . Because it is impossible to eliminate a possibility that the certification apparatus changes an assigned value at after the time t .

Note that the above apparatuses are formed by electronic apparatuses each having a CPU Central Processing Unit having at least a calculating function and a control function a main memory having a function to store programs and data such as RAM Random Access Memory and a secondary memory capable of continuing to memorize data even at powered off such as HD Hard Disc . The operation of the audit information drafting part of the certification apparatus the operation of the complementary data requesting part of the audit apparatus and the operation of the event ordering certification audit part of the audit apparatus are nothing but respective crystallizations of the above calculating control functions of the above central processing units. Additionally the memory part of the certification apparatus and the memory part of the audit apparatus are equipped with the above mentioned functions of either the main memory or the secondary memory.

Each program for executing a variety of processes in this embodiment is stored in either the main memory or the secondary memory mentioned above. In connection this program may be recorded in a computer readable recording medium e.g. hard disc flexible disc CD ROM MO DVD ROM etc. or delivered through a communication network.

In the event ordering certification system constructed above the event ordering certification method and the event ordering certification validation method will be described with reference to . In these figures is a sequence diagram to explain the operation of the certification apparatus to draft an event receipt and an audit receipt for one sequential aggregation period while is a sequence diagram to explain the operation of one user apparatus to carry out the second validation against the even receipt.

We first describe the event ordering certification method of . As for the event ordering certification method of the second embodiment constituent processes are almost similar to those of the first embodiment. Thus the operations at steps S to S of are identical to those at steps S to S of the . The event ordering certification method of the second embodiment differs from that of the first embodiment in the addition of subsequent steps S to S. The following description is directed to these steps S to S.

On completion of the constant period for sequential aggregation the audit information drafting part of the audit apparatus acquires the completed late complementary data of respective audit receipts issued for this aggregation period in response to the completed late complementary data request from the audit apparatus and successively sends the data to the audit apparatus steps S S S S .

Then the audit apparatus receives the completed late complementary data of the respective audit receipts step S .

In connection with the above mentioned event ordering certification method of where the audit apparatus sends the completed late complementary data request to the certification apparatus and it subsequently sends the completed late complementary data to the audit apparatus the method may be modified in a manner that the certification apparatus sends the completed late complementary data to the audit apparatus automatically.

Next the event ordering certification validation method using the audit apparatus will be described with reference to . This method corresponds to the second validation function of the user apparatus . The second validation function of the user apparatus is identical to the validation function of the first embodiment i.e. future bounding of user point plus a new validation function i.e. past bounding of user point . illustrates this new validation function. In this embodiment the validation processes about future bounding of user point are identical to those of the first embodiment of and therefore their descriptions are eliminated. Additionally the validation method corresponding to the first validation function of the user apparatus is identical to that of the first embodiment and therefore its descriptions are eliminated similarly.

In the user apparatus sends audit request information including a receipt as an audit target but including the instant complementary data to the audit apparatus steps S S .

Then when the audit apparatus receives the audit request information through the transmitting receiving part the event ordering certification audit part specifies a sequential aggregation tree leaf where the receipt in the audit request information is assigned and calculates an audit point positioned on the left of the so specified leaf steps S S . Next the audit apparatus acquires an audit receipt of the audit point and completed late complementary data for the audit receipt step S .

In succession the audit apparatus calculates a certification point for the audit point by the leaf and further calculates an assigned value Acal of the above certification point from the audit receipt of the audit point and completed late complementary data for the audit receipt steps S S . On the other hand the event ordering certification audit part acquires an assigned value A of this certification point that the part has already received as the audit request information and verifies whether the assigned value A of the certification point coincides with the assigned value Acal on calculation steps S S .

If the above validation is completed in success then it is possible to confirm that the receipt is not subjected to tamper step S . On the other hand if the above validation is failed it is possible to confirm that the receipt is subjected to tamper step S . The event ordering certification audit part sends this audit result to the user apparatus through the transmitting receiving part while the user apparatus receives the audit result step S S .

Consequently even before publishing by an electronic publishing organization each user apparatus can absolutely verify that the receipt published by the certification apparatus is one that was issued during the relevant sequential aggregation period and also issued against original data included in the receipt in order identified by a sequential aggregation tree leaf number included in the receipt. Additionally the apparatus can verify the past bounding of the user point. Note that the above audit result may contain an identifier of the audit point . In this case the user apparatus can obtain an assurance that the registration of an event ordering request corresponding to the receipt requiring the above audit was carried out before the registration of an audit event ordering request corresponding to the audit point from the audit apparatus absolutely.

Note that the above description is related to the operation of validation about the past bounding of a user point. Besides the audit apparatus may perform a validation about past bounding of user point together with the future bounding of a user point. In this case the receipt and the late complementary data in the first embodiment would be required as the audit information.

According to the event ordering certification system of the second embodiment it is possible to bring about the same effects as the first embodiment. In addition when the legitimacy of a receipt can be verified it is possible to certify that the certification apparatus receiving of an event ordering request of the receipt as audit target has occurred behind the same apparatus receiving of an event ordering request of the audit receipt temporally.

Regarding the second embodiment mentioned above various modifications and changes can be made. Such modifications of the second embodiment will be described below.

The audit apparatus is also capable of judging the sequential order between two user points owing to the above mentioned functions of future bounding of user point and past bounding of user point . Suppose two user apparatuses and acquire receipts at sequential aggregation tree leaves and respectively. We now describe a method of the audit apparatus for auditing the temporal context between and with reference to . is a flow chart showing the operation of the audit apparatus for auditing the temporal context between and .

In the following descriptions about the sequential aggregation tree leaves and a terminology time point or represents a point of time when an event ordering request assigned to or is received. Therefore represents that the time point is present after the time point . Assume in the following descriptions represents a larger one in and and additionally the serialisablity of the certification apparatus is ensured until its transmission of a receipt against an event ordering request received at the leaf .

Suppose that the user apparatuses and the audit apparatus respectively satisfy with the conditions 1 to 3 described in future bounding of user point of the first embodiment.

When the audit apparatus receives judgment requests of the sequential order of the receipts between the users from the user apparatuses and it is determined to let either a point equal to or a leftmost point of the audit points on the right of be represented by and also let a point equal to or a leftmost point of the audit points on the right of be represented by steps S S S .

Next the temporal context between and is verified step S . This operation is accomplished by judging both sequential aggregation tree number and sequential aggregation tree leaf number of the audit receipts of the respective audit points.

Let a point equal to or a rightmost point of the audit points on the left of be represented by . Then is established. Additionally as is shown by the method of future bounding of user point while is shown by the method of past bounding of user point 

If then the judgment in temporal context between and is carried out in the following procedures 1 to 3 .

 1 From information that the user apparatus has acquired at and its late complementary point the position of a certification point for the user point by the audit point and an assigned value of the certification point are calculated. If this assigned value of the certification point is included in instant complementary data in the audit receipt acquired at the audit point by the audit apparatus then it judges that is present on the left of the point and further verifies how far is apart from to the left i.e. by the number of points . Assume here is present at an n. point to the left of a step S .

 2 Similarly from information that the user apparatus has acquired at and its late complementary point the position of a certification point for the user point by the audit point and an assigned value of the certification point are calculated. If this assigned value of the certification point is included in instant complementary data in the audit receipt acquired at the audit point by the audit apparatus then it judges that is present on the left of the point and further verifies how far is apart from to the left i.e. by the number of points . Assume here is positioned at an n. point to the left of step S .

If n n then the audit apparatus can exhibit that the user point by the user apparatus is present on the left of the user point by the user apparatus step S . While if n

According to the first modification of the second embodiment it is possible to judge the temporal context of receipts in addition to the effects of the second embodiment.

Alternatively after completion of each sequential aggregation period the audit apparatus may acquire the completed late complementary data of respective audit receipts acquired for the sequential aggregation period simultaneously calculate a root value in the sequential aggregation tree from each audit receipt and its complete complementary data and verify whether the so calculated root value coincides with a root value on publication. This operation of the audit apparatus will be referred to as root value validation by combined completion .

The above mentioned operations of the audit apparatus are direct to an aim to verify that no falseness is carried out by the certification apparatus as shown in steps S S S S S .

Additionally the audit apparatus can verify the legitimacy of audit request information included in the audit request of the user apparatus due to the function of root value validation by combined completion .

Suppose after completing to form a sequential aggregation tree the user apparatus changes the assigned value for a leaf from an intrinsic assigned value V to an assigned value v and argues that this assigned value v links V root SBT by hash function. Then in order to allow a third person to admit this argument the user apparatus has to prepare complementary data for the leaf 

Thus according to the second modification of the second embodiment it is possible to verify the legitimacy of a root value of the sequential aggregation tree published by an electronic information publishing organization in addition to the effect of the second embodiment. Additionally even if there arises a falseness in either the certification apparatus or the user apparatus it is possible to curve the falseness due to the root value validation function of the audit apparatus .

Additionally the audit apparatus has a function of providing each of the user apparatuses with the complete complementary data. Below this operation will be referred to as complementary data completion . This function will operate effectively if the certification apparatus stops its service due to an obstacle or the like. Further even if the certification apparatus does not stop the service the function would be of assistance to lightening of burden on the apparatus when the public data is published or the requests for complementary data irrupt temporarily.

Assume in the audit apparatus possesses complete complementary data for an audit point a. In this case by combining the complete complementary data with information that the user apparatus can acquire at a user point u to obtain an event ordering receipt and another point u to obtain its late complementary data it is possible for the user apparatus to calculate complete complementary data for the user point u. Note that this possibility will be referred to as feature P after.

In let j be a level of a certification point for the user point u by the audit point a. The reason about the apparatus possibility is that in the authentication path information at the user point u the information about nodes each lower than the level j is acquired by the user while the information about a node higher than the level j and lower than a level k is acquired by the audit apparatus .

Consider as one example we are given an one day type audit apparatus disclosing at one week intervals i.e. acquiring the audit information at least one time per day thereby acquiring the complete complementary data of each audit point . Provided that the audit apparatus acquires late complementary data after the lapse of one or more days since the user apparatus receives a receipt then it becomes possible to construct complete complementary data for the receipt by combining the information acquired by the user apparatus with the information acquired by the audit apparatus due to the above feature P .

Referring to a method for the user apparatus to acquire complete complementary data through two or more audit apparatuses i a b n will be described. Suppose as the audit apparatuses we are given an one day type audit apparatus i.e. acquiring the audit information at least one time per day thereby acquiring the complete complementary data of each audit point mentioned above and an one hour type audit apparatus i.e. acquiring the audit information at least one time per hour and establishing respective late complementary data points of respective audit points so as to interleave the audit point of the audit apparatus which depends on the apparatus

In the above supposition the user apparatus acquires late complementary data after the lapse of one or more hours since receiving a receipt. In such a case by combining the information acquired by the user apparatus with the information acquired by the audit apparatus and the information acquired by the audit apparatus it becomes possible to construct complete complementary data of the user point.

This possibility can be accomplished represented by using the above feature P repeatedly. First by combining the information acquired by the audit apparatus with that by the audit apparatus authentication path information for an audit point a is obtained. Thus as similar to the case of there can be acquired authentication path information for a user point u.

As for the audit points of the above mentioned audit apparatuses and for instance the one hour type audit apparatus depending on the audit apparatus may acquire the late complementary data for one s own each audit point after the lapse of one or more days since the user apparatus reception of the receipt. Alternatively so long as it is recognized that the audit point of the one day type audit apparatus is acquired at the fixed time in one day e.g. AM 0 00 the late complementary data for the audit point everyday may be collected up after the end of each day. Although there are adopted two audit apparatuses in the above example three or more audit apparatuses may be adopted in modifications.

Note that in this embodiment constitutions and functions different from those of the above embodiments will be described. Regarding the other constitutions and functions their descriptions are eliminated while elements identical to those of the first embodiment are indicated with the same reference numerals respectively.

Similarly to the first embodiment the system architecture of the event ordering certification system is not limited to this only and therefore it may be modified to various forms so long as its identity in function. For instance user validation apparatuses time stamping apparatuses may verify the receipts in place of the user time stamping apparatuses . Additionally in place of the certification apparatus the electronic information publication apparatus may obtain published data from the certification apparatus and release the published data to the public. Moreover the computer network may be replaced by other communicating means such as postal mail.

Assume also in this embodiment the serialisablity of the certification apparatus is ensured as similar to the first embodiment. As ensuring means a serialisablity audit apparatus may be employed as similar to the first embodiment.

The time information offering apparatus retains accurate time information and supplies the user time stamping apparatuses and the audit apparatus with the time information.

Each user apparatus requests a time stamping containing designated data to the corresponding user time stamping apparatus and subsequently acquires a time receipt having the time information from the user time stamping apparatus

The user time stamping apparatus has the function of a time stamping apparatus in addition to the function of the user apparatus as mentioned above. The user time stamping apparatus comprises a transmitting receiving part for transferring data to and from the audit apparatus the user apparatus and the time information offering apparatus a time stamp drafting part for drafting a time receipt on acceptance of a time stamping request from the user apparatus an event ordering requesting part for requesting a certification containing a time receipt digest a complementary data requesting part for requesting complementary data of a receipt which is acquirable at the present moment an event ordering certification verifying part for verifying the receipt and a memory part for storing information about event ordering certification including the receipt and information about time stamping including the time receipt. Note that although this embodiment adopts a user apparatus doubling as a time stamping apparatus there may exists a user apparatus that does not double as the time stamping apparatus allowing provision of a system structure where the user time stamping apparatuses and the user apparatuses are mixed together.

In detail the time stamp drafting part accepts the time stamping request including designated digital data transmitted from the user apparatus and successively drafts the time receipt where the time information from the time information offering apparatus is attached to the digital data.

The event ordering requesting part operates to incorporate the time receipt digest i.e. a hash value of the time receipt drafted for the time stamping request from the user apparatus into an event ordering request. In detail this time receipt digest corresponds to a result of applying a collision resistant one way hash function which is prepared by the user time stamping apparatus in advance on the time receipt. Accordingly the receipt that the user time stamping apparatus receives from the certification apparatus has a structure shown in . However as mentioned above the original digital data in the certificate contains the time receipt digest.

In addition to the function of the audit apparatus of the first embodiment the audit apparatus of this embodiment has a function as a time auditing apparatus. The audit apparatus comprises the transmitting receiving part the event ordering certification audit part a block time stamping certificate drafting part and a memory part . In detail the transmitting receiving part transfers data to and from the certification apparatus the user time stamping apparatuses and the time information offering apparatus through the computer network . When receiving the audit request for a certain receipt from the user time stamping apparatus the event ordering certification audit part verifies the receipt while using the audit request information transmitted from the user time stamping apparatuses and the audit information and sends the audit result to the user time stamping apparatuses . The block time stamping certificate drafting part drafts a block time stamping certificate for certifying a time block including the time attached on the time receipt corresponding to the receipt on audit. The memory part stores the audit information including the audit receipt and the block time certificate. Note that although this embodiment adopts as the event ordering certification audit apparatus an audit apparatus doubling as an event time audit apparatus there may exist an audit apparatus that does not double as the event time audit apparatus allowing provision of a system structure where the audit apparatus and the audit apparatus are mixed together.

The block time stamping certificate drafting part acquires the time of its receiving an audit receipt from the certification apparatus from the time information offering apparatus and further attaches the time to the block time certificate. Thus in this embodiment the block time certificate drafted by the block time stamping certificate drafting part includes a time stamp bounding on the future side. As previously mentioned in the first embodiment since the validation of an event ordering certificate using the audit apparatus i.e. the second validation by the user apparatus makes it possible to certify that the leaf of the sequential aggregation tree where the event ordering request is assigned is temporally former of the leaf of the audit point the time stamp bounding on the future side certifies nothing but the acceptance of a time stamping request from the user apparatus having its origin in requesting the event ordering certificate is temporally former of the time when the audit apparatus received the audit receipt. This block time certificate in this embodiment will be referred to as the first class block time certificate after.

Note that the above apparatuses are formed by electronic apparatuses each having a CPU Central Processing Unit having at least a calculating function and a control function a main memory having a function to store programs and data such as RAM Random Access Memory and a secondary memory capable of continuing to memorize data even at powered off such as HD Hard Disc . The operations of respective parts of the user time stamping apparatus i.e. the time stamp drafting part the event ordering requesting part the complementary data requesting part the event ordering certification verifying part and the operation of the block time stamping certificate drafting part of the audit apparatus are nothing but respective crystallizations of the above calculating control functions of the above central processing unit. Additionally the memory part of the user time stamping apparatus and the memory part of the audit apparatus are respectively equipped with the above mentioned functions of either the main memory or the secondary memory.

Each program for executing a variety of processes in this embodiment is stored in either the main memory or the secondary memory mentioned above. In connection this program may be recorded in a computer readable recording medium e.g. hard disc flexible disc CD ROM MO DVD ROM etc. or delivered through a communication network.

In the event ordering certification system constructed above the event ordering certification method and the event ordering certification validation method will be described with reference to .

Regarding the event ordering certification method its overall operation is substantially the same as the operation of assuming that the user time stamping apparatuses and the audit apparatus correspond to the user apparatuses and the audit apparatus respectively. Therefore the following descriptions are mainly directed to an interaction between the user time stamping apparatus and the user apparatus which is different from the operation of . are sequence diagrams to closely explain the operation of step S to send an event ordering request corresponding to step S. Note that also contains step S for receiving the receipt corresponding to step S of . Further is a sequence diagram to closely explain the operation of step S to receive a receipt certificate for audit referred to as audit receipt later corresponding to step S of .

Further in the first validation of the event ordering validation method if assuming that the user time stamping apparatus corresponds to the user apparatus then the operation of validation is identical to that of and therefore its description is eliminated. In the second validation of the event ordering validation method if assuming that the audit apparatus corresponds to the audit apparatus then the operation of validation is identical to that of and therefore we now explain the drafting of a block time certificate by the audit apparatus which is different from the operation of . is a sequence diagram explaining step S in case of succeeding the validation of an event receipt corresponding to step S of in detail.

Referring to we first describe step S of sending an event ordering request of the event ordering certification method.

When the user apparatus sends a time stamping request including digital data to the user time stamping apparatus it receives the time stamping request including digital data through the transmitting receiving part steps S S . Next the time stamp drafting part of the apparatus acquires the time of receiving the time stamping request from the time information offering apparatus drafts a time receipt certificate referred to as time receipt after having the time applied on the digital data and send the time receipt to the user apparatus steps S S S . In this way the user apparatus can acquire the time receipt step S .

Next the event ordering requesting part of the user time stamping apparatus drafts a digest of the time receipt further drafts an event ordering request including this time receipt digest and sends it to the certification apparatus steps S S . In this way the certification apparatus receives the event ordering request through the transmitting receiving part step S .

Although only the time receipt is sent to the user apparatus in the above mentioned method there may be expected a method of sending a receipt in addition to the time receipt to the user apparatus

In at the event ordering requesting step step S it is not executed to send back the time receipt. Instead at the event receipt receiving step step S corresponding to step S of it is executed to send back the time receipt and the receipt. That is the user time stamping apparatus sends the receipt and the corresponding time receipt to the user apparatus when receiving the receipt from the certification apparatus steps S S . In this way the user apparatus receives both the receipt and the time receipt step S .

When receiving the audit receipt from the certification apparatus through the transmitting receiving part the audit apparatus acquires the time of receiving the audit receipt from the time information offering apparatus and memorizes the time in the memory part while coordinating the audit receipt steps S S S .

Referring to we now describe the operation of step S when the audit apparatus succeeds in verifying an event receipt.

The event ordering certification audit part of the audit apparatus audits a receipt in response to the audit request from the user time stamping apparatus . When the audit result is well OK the audit part publishes the first class block time certificate by the time accompanied with the audit receipt and incorporates the first class block time certificate into the audit result steps S S S .

Accordingly according to the event ordering certification system of the third embodiment it is possible to bring about the same effect as the first embodiment. Additionally owing to the publication of the first class block time certificate it is possible to provide a time stamp bounding on the future side.

In the third embodiment the audit apparatus having a function as the time audit apparatus is employed in place of the audit apparatus of the first embodiment. In one modification of the third embodiment an audit apparatus having the function of the time audit apparatus may be employed in place of the audit apparatus of the second embodiment.

According to the modification of the third embodiment the block time stamping certificate drafting part acquires the time of its sending the audit event ordering request to the certification apparatus from the time information offering apparatus and further attaches the time to the block time certificate. Thus in this modification the block time certificate drafted by the block time stamping certificate drafting part includes a time stamp bounding on the past side

As previously mentioned in the second embodiment since the validation of an event ordering certificate using the audit apparatus i.e. the second validation by the user apparatus makes it possible to certify that the leaf of the sequential aggregation tree where the event ordering request is assigned is temporally later of the leaf of one audit point the time stamp bounding on the future side certifies nothing but the transmission of the time receipt by the user time stamping apparatus against a time stamping request from the user apparatus having its origin in requesting the event ordering certification is temporally former of the time when the audit apparatus sent the audit event ordering request. This block time certificate in this embodiment will be referred to as the second class block time certificate after.

In this modification since the audit apparatus has a function to publish the first class block time certificate justifiably it is possible to publish the third class block time certificate being a block time certificate having time stamps bounding on the future and past sides. This is provided to certify that the acceptance of a time stamping request from the user apparatus having its origin in requesting the event ordering certificate is temporally former of the time when the audit apparatus received the audit receipt and that the transmission of a time receipt by the user time stamping apparatus against the time stamping request of the user apparatus is temporally later of the time when the audit apparatus sent the audit event ordering request.

In a further modification of the third embodiment an event ordering system may be provided with an event time validation apparatus not shown in . In operation this event time validation apparatus operates to acquire a time receipt published by each of the user time stamping apparatuses and one or more block time certificates for certifying a temporally former boundary of the time applied on the time receipt a temporally later boundary of the time or both boundaries of the time. Based on the so acquired certificates the event time validation apparatus judges the validity of the time applied on the time receipt. In detail if a probability that the time applied on the time receipt is included in a time block certified by the block time certificates with a predetermined allowable error is larger than a predetermined value then the event time validation apparatus judges the validity of the time applied on the time receipt.

The certification apparatuses and the electronic information publishing part were not explained in the above descriptions in detail. Nevertheless preferably information publishing in the computerized society is required to meet with the following requirements.

 3 When each of the above entities acquires information to be published an entity certification of a resource center is provided while the perfectibility of information on provision is ensured by the resource center.

In these requirements the requirement 1 could be realized since some service organizations provide their occupations with a certain category of information. It is noted that the above mentioned embodiment fills the requirement 1 since the certification apparatus and the plural audit apparatuses provide as their occupations the information about the root value etc. of the sequential aggregation tree.

The requirement 2 can be accomplished due to information provision through WWW World Wide Web in widespread use of recent years.

The requirement 3 can be accomplished by applying a digital signature based on the public key cryptosystem to information for provision. In this application it is necessary that the digital signature has sufficient intensity and the effectiveness of a private key for signature and a public key pairing with this at that time is ensured by PKI Public Key Infrastructure with the use of a public key certificate CRL Certificate Revocation List OCSP Online Certificate Status Protocol service etc. The pair of keys are adequate so long as being effective at the point of acquiring the information by an information demandant. By renewing the pair of keys as needed it is possible to maintain the effectiveness of the key pair. In replacing one key pair KP SK PK by a new key pair KP SK PK it is not indispensable to create a digital signature by the private key SK of the key pair KP within an available period of the key pair KP. Required is that when a user has access to the above entities a digital signature is produced by using a key pair that is effective at that time.

Hitherto it has been carried out to make the information public to mass media such as newspapers as means for information publishing. However it should be noted that this publishing method is not necessarily appropriate as measure for information publishing in this computer controlled society. Because it is difficult to meet the requirement 2 since it is not easy for a user using the above method to access information published on a specific mass media for example 10 years after. Even if possible to access it is impossible for the user to acquire the information while meeting the above requirement 3 .

As for the sequential aggregation tree employed in the above mentioned embodiments in common its dynamic constitutive method and feature will be described below. On the assumption we first explain a basic function essential to the constitution of the sequential aggregation tree.

A sequential aggregation tree of height k is formed by respective nodes at levels to k. Since the number of nodes at level j j 0 1 . . . k is 2 under the notation that j i denotes a node at level j and by number i then i 0 1 . . . 2 1.

Assume ceiling x denotes a minimum integer more than x and floor x denotes a maximum integer less than x for a real number x.

Let V j i be an assigned value of node j i and V i be expressed by V i . Further assume that L is a negative integer satisfying L k and SBT is a certain sequential aggregation tree. Then it is defined a subgraph B of SBT is a partial tree at level L as there exists a certain node p at level L belonging to SBT so that B is a subgraph of SBT composed of the node p and its descendants .

Assume that B is a partial tree of SBT. Then leafs B represents a set of leaves forming the tree B. Assume that X is a non empty set composed of leaves of SBT. Then first X represents a leftmost leaf in the set X and last X represents a rightmost leaf in the set X.

Let i . . . i be the set interval of integers i satisfying i i i for two integers i and i i . . . i be the set interval of integers i satisfying i

In accordance with the above definitions about the basic function we now describe a first method of forming an aggregation tree dynamically. In the first method a difference in depth is suppressed less than 1 and no dummy node is produced.

Assume that the number of event ordering requests to be accepted for an aggregation period e.g. one week is previously fixed by a method of some kind. Let n be the fixed number of requests. Then the height of the aggregation tree is k ceiling log n . Here the maximum number of leaves in the tree of height k is 2. Thus on condition d 2 n if only eliminating nodes at level in the number of 2d then it becomes possible to assign the event ordering requests number n to respective leaves without producing any dummy node. The reason is as follows If the number of leaves at level is reduced by number 2d then new leaves at level number n are produced. As a result due to a reduction in the number of leaves by number d the total number of leaves results in n 2 d.

Let LW 2 the number of nodes at level LL 2 d the number of nodes at level having children and LL 2 2 d the number of nodes at level . If for n event ordering requests n the number of requests first arranging LL requests at level first and subsequently arranging while the remaining requests at level then a function place i representing a destination of an ievent ordering request can be described as

Next the second method of forming a sequential aggregation tree will be described. The second method is the same as the first method in terms of forming the sequential aggregation tree incrementally and differs from the first method in point of assuming that the number of event ordering requests to be accepted at predetermined intervals every sequential aggregation period cannot be anticipated.

Here the above terminology incremental means that it is executed with respect to each acceptance of the event ordering requests to calculate a part of the sequential aggregation tree that could be calculated by the acceptance. Although the number of event ordering requests on acceptance cannot be anticipated we describes on the assumption that the upper limit N can be estimated. Assume in this method the event ordering requests are all assigned at level and a dummy node is employed to calculate a root value for a binary tree.

In forming a sequential aggregation tree by this method if representing the number of event ordering requests accepted for a designated aggregation period e.g. one week by N then a height k of the sequential aggregation tree is represented by k ceiling log N . As the number of the sequential aggregation tree of height k is 2at the maximum n event ordering requests 0 1 . . . n 1 are assigned to respective nodes at level i.e. from node to node n 1 .

In general rtPathk j i is represented by rtPathk j i j r j . . . k r k . Assume here that r j floor i 2 for j j . . . k . Then at respective levels j j 0 . . . k 1 the followings are established 

If r j is an even number nodes j r j 1 become dummy nodes and respective nodes j i for i under r j 1 i 2are eliminated 

In the sequential aggregation tree based on the above method the dummy node appears only on the right end at each level. The number of dummy nodes drafted is less than k.

Under the above definitions when a processing procedure of is completed namely when the designated sequential aggregation period is completed n k ij bj and Aj represent the number of time processing requests the height of a so formed sequential aggregation tree the number of nodes at level j whether or not there is a dummy node at level j and an alignment of values assigned to the nodes at level j respectively.

At level node becomes a dummy node by step ... . At level a value is assigned to node by step .... so that node forms a dummy node. At level a value is assigned to node by step .... so that node forms a dummy node. At level a value is assigned to node by step ... . At level a value is assigned to node by step ... .

As a result the sequential aggregation tree as shown in can be constructed incrementally. At each level there is only one dummy node at most. It is necessary to assign a dummy label assigned dummy value to the dummy node in accordance with any procedure determined in advance. As a simple definition of such a procedure there exists a method of defining a dummy label as the function of level. Thus this method may be adopted.

The first to third embodiments mentioned above are provided on the assumption that the sequential aggregation tree is completed with the use of dummy nodes on each occasion of publishing information. However the other method may be adopted as one concrete method of forming a sequential aggregation tree.

In detail the event ordering certification systems and in the above mentioned embodiments can employ any one of the above mentioned methods of dynamically forming the sequential aggregation tree. Therefore due to the possibility of coping with quantitative alteration in the number of even ordering requests from the user apparatuses with flexibility it is possible to build an even ordering certification system having improved scalability.

For nodes in an incrementally formed sequential aggregation tree having no predetermined height it is possible to define a root path and an authentication path at a certain point of time as follows. Note that this definition is applicable for a situation such that the number of requests accepted during a predetermined sequential aggregation period cannot be anticipated in advance in the first to third embodiments.

Assume that m minh m 1 2 when a maximum value in the leaf number at the present moment is m 0 and therefore the number of leaves is m 1 and curSBT m denote a sequential aggregation tree having height m .

Assume that p i j curSBT m and a row of nodes from p to a root of curSBT m is represent by a root path rtPath p m .

 rtPath p m represents a row of nodes whose assigned values are to be determined at the point when an assigned value for an m. leaf of leaves belonging to the root path rtPath p m is determined.

An aggregate of nodes p j i essential to calculate a root value of curSBT m from node p j i will be called authentication path of the node and represented by authPathT p m . Note that for each node belonging to an authentication path it includes information about a direction left or right junctural to the node in the form of tags.

then authPathT p m can be expressed by using rtPath p m as follows authPath . . . 1 1 1 where when r j is an even number a j r j 1 LR j R and when r j is an odd number a j r j 1 LR j L for j j . . . k 1 .

As for the element j a j LR j of authathT p m part LR j will be called LR tag . Further regarding the element j r j of rtPath p m j r j 1 in case of an even number of r j will be called right complementary point of j r j while j r j 1 in case of an odd number of r j will be called left complementary point of j r j after.

Then authPathT p m consists of right or left complementary points of points except the root of rtPath p m .

The authPathT p m except for information of LR tag will be called authPathT p m . That is if authPath . . . 1 1 1 then authPath . . . 1 1 is established. On the contrary if authPath . . . 1 1 1 is given then authPathT p m can be calculated as follows For j j . . . k a node at level j forming rtPath p m is presented by

For authPath p m and authPathT p m respective aggregates of nodes that their assigned values have been already determined at that time when an assigned value of m. leaf becomes definite are defined as authPathD p m and authPathTD p m respectively. When authPath p m and authPathT p m are expressed as above there exist satisfying 1 and

Additionally assume that authPathDV p m and authiPathTDV p m represents authPathD t m and authPathTD t m plus assigned values of respective nodes belonging to authPathD p m and authPathTD p m respectively. In detail when authPathDV p m and authPathTDV p m are expressed as above there are established authPath 0 0 0 . . . 1 1 1 1 1 1 and authPath 0 0 0 . . . 1 1 1 1 0 . . . 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 where v j V j a j for each j j . . . j k 1 .

On condition that a relevant sequential aggregation tree is completed at that stage of assigning an assigned value to a leaf numbered m in accordance with any of the above mentioned forming methods and that authPathTDV p m is represented as above it is possible to calculate a root value of the sequential aggregation tree by an assigned value V p of node p j i and also authPathTDV p m in the following manner. For j j . . . k v j is defined by the following 1 and 2 recursively. Then v k becomes a root value of the sequential aggregation tree.

Suppose that m m denote respective leaf numbers of leaves in a sequential aggregation tree where m m. Then curSBT m1 curSBT m2 is satisfied.

In the following descriptions assuming that m represents a maximum value of leaf numbers at the present moment about an incrementally formed sequential aggregation tree the terminologies 

authPath i m authPathT i m authPathD i m authPathTD i m authPathDV i m and authPathTDV i m may be abbreviated to

authPath i m authPathT i m authPathD i m authPathTD i m authPathDV i m and authPathTDV i m respectively.

We now explain an algorithm to calculate an authentication point of a user point by an audit point in the sequential aggregation tree. Let k denote a height of a sequential aggregation tree i an identification number of the user point and let i denote an identification number of the audit point where i

By this procedure it is carried out to calculate both root path rtPath i m for node i and root path rtPath i m for node i . As a result rtPath i m comes to coincide with rtPath i m since a certain element. Then the element where rtPath i m coincides with rtPath i m at first is called confluent point between node i and node i . Further a left child of the confluent point is referred to as authentication point of node i i.e. user point by node i i.e. audit point .

Described above is the definition of an authentication point where a user point and an audit point belong to an identical sequential aggregation tree together. Nevertheless in case that a sequential aggregation tree that another sequential aggregation tree containing the audit point does belong to is produced after the formation of a sequential aggregation tree SBT that the user point belongs to a root of SBT is defined as authentication point of the user point by the audit point .

Let B be a partial sequential aggregation tree forming a certain sequential aggregation tree. Also assume that the processing of a round corresponding to last leafs B has been already completed at a certain point of time. At that point of time assigned values for respective nodes belonging to B have been calculated and assigned to these nodes.

In accordance with the method of to form a sequent aggregation tree incrementally it is executed at each completion of respective rounds to calculate all assigned values for other nodes except leaves calculable by assigned values for leaves acquired until the round in question and assign the calculated values to these nodes.

At the point of finishing the processing of the round corresponding to last leafs B there are already determined assigned values of respective leaves belonging to leafs B allowing assigned values of each node forming the partial tree B to be calculated. Thus at this stage the assigned values of respective nodes forming the tree B are calculated and assigned to the nodes. For the sequential aggregation tree whose height is not determined yet and which is formed incrementally a feature 2 will be established as follows.

Let C Z i and i denote a user apparatus an audit apparatus and two sequential aggregation tree leaf numbers respectively where i

 1 An assigned value of the authentication point is included in complementary data in the receipt at the audit point that is node i .

 2 If the above authentication point is expressed by j i then assigned values for nodes belonging to authPath i j and each having its level smaller than j are included in either late complementary data that a user receiving a receipt at a round corresponding to node i could receive after the above round or complementary data in the receipt.

That is if i i then assigned values for nodes belonging to authPath i j and each having its level smaller than j are included in either EOC i or CToken i i .

 3 The assigned value of the above authentication point and the assigned values of nodes belonging to rtPath i i whose level is smaller than the level of the authentication point can be calculated from the receipt incl. in receipt complementary data that a user has received at node i and the late complementary data that the user receives on and after a round corresponding to node i .

We now describe a case of incorporating in receipt complementary data immediate complementary data into a receipt to be delivered to a user. Even when not incorporating the in receipt complementary data into the receipt but instead incorporating the same information into late complementary data the same conclusion could be attained with similar argument.

 1 First an item 1 will be described with reference to . Assume here j i denotes a confluent point. Let j i be an authentication point being a left child of the above confluent point. In rtPath i i of node i in surSBT i it is assumed that j i represents a node originating in node i and just before the confluent point. Then the authentication point coincides with a left complementary point of j i . Thus according to the definition of the authentication path authPathT i i j i L is included in the authentication path of node i in curSBT i . The assignment of a value for node j i has been completed before round i . Therefore j i L V j i is included in an in receipt complementary data against node i .

The authentication point j r j is included in root path rtPath i i for node i . Assume here that Path 0 0 1 0 0 . . . 1 . . . .

Further an array row of nodes formed by elements of authPath i j and having each level smaller than j is represented by 0 s 0 . . . j 1 s j 1 .

Then it has only to certify that V j r j is included in either EOC i or CToken i i for each j i.e. j 0 . . . j 1 .

By the definition of authPath i i it is noted that an element p j s j at level j of authPath i i is either a right of an element p at level j 1 of rtPath i i and the left child. We describe both cases respectively.

 Case 1 When p is the right child of p an assigned value V p for p is included in the late complementary data CToken i i that the apparatus C can receive at i satisfying i j as shown in . The reason is as follows. By the feature 1 of the sequential aggregation tree when the event ordering certification process on the round corresponding to leaf i is completed it has already become possible to calculate an assigned value for a partial tree of curSBT i indicated with B of . As a matter of fact the assigned values have been already calculated and assigned. Accordingly the late complementary data published on and after the above point of completion contains the assigned value V p for the root p of the partial tree B.

 Case 2 When p is the left child of p an assigned value V p for node p is included in an in receipt complementary data for event ordering demanders on the round i as shown in . The reason is that

Accordingly at the start of a round distinguished by i under BcurSBT i an assigned value for leafs B has become definite already. Thus according to the feature 1 of the sequential aggregation tree an assigned value for p root B has become definite at the round distinguished by i. Therefore p is included in authPathD i .

 3 By the definition of authentication path and item 2 it is possible to calculate V j r j for each j 0 . . . j recursively as follows.

Assume that V j r j was calculated for j 0 . . . j 1 . Then V j 1 r j 1 is calculated as follows 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 for 1 

Note that the following description is based on the premise that a point of time of starting the service of the event ordering certification system coincides with an origin of time one parameter e.g. one second one milli second etc. is established as a clocking unit and a time point is represented by an integral number as a result of clocking a passage of time since the above origin of time by the above clocking unit. Assume furthermore at a first audit point in each sequential aggregation period T each audit apparatus Z receives not only audit information closed in the period T but also a previously obtained root value. For instance the previously obtained root value is formed by a value V root T assigned to a root during a sequential aggregation period T just before the first audit point.

For an incrementally constructed sequential aggregation tree because of no predetermined height there is established a next feature 3.

Below let T be a positive integer and let and be respective identifiers of extended leaves. Assuming that Z denotes an audit apparatus at an audit point of the audit apparatus Z the following condition 1 is satisfied time 0 0 1 

Additionally assuming that and represent one optional audit point of the audit apparatus and the next audit point respectively the following condition 2 is satisfied time time 2 Assuming that a user A sends a certain event ordering request denotes a leaf of a sequential aggregation tree against this request subsequently the user A requests late complementary data for its event receipt denotes another leaf against this request for late complementary data the following condition 3 is satisfied time time 3 Assume at a first audit point belonging to each sequential aggregation period on and after the second sequential aggregation period the audit apparatus Z receives a root value of a preceding sequential aggregation period from an event ordering certification organization.

 2 For the audit point satisfying . . . an assigned value label for an authentication point of by is included in an audit receipt that the audit apparatus Z receives at a certain leaf e.g. after the audit point .

 3 There exists an audit point by the audit apparatus Z for an optional leaf and the following condition 4 is then satisfied time time 

 4 For an optional user point satisfying T time there exists an audit point by the audit apparatus Z which satisfies 

 1 Suppose that there exists no audit point by the audit apparatus Z which satisfies . . . . Situations are classified depending on whether there exists an audit point of the audit apparatus Z positioned on the left of or not.

 Case 1 The situation where there exists an audit point of Z on the left of is discussed. Assume that an audit point on the left of and also closest to is represented by and another audit point on the right of and also closest to is represented by . Since time 1 and time 2 time 1 However this conclusion contradicts the assumption of absence of an audit point by Z satisfying time time . . . time . Consequently there exists an audit point satisfying time time . . . time .

 Case 2 The situation where there exists no audit point of Z on the left of is discussed. Then for the audit point satisfying time 0 . . . T . . . is shown.

 Case 1 The situation where there exists an audit point of Z before is discussed. Assume that an audit point before and latest to is represented by and the time of the next audit point is represented by . Then time 

 Case 2 The situation where there exists no audit point of Z before is discussed. Then by the assumption of Feature 3 there exists an audit point by Z satisfying time 

 4 It is led straightforward by the above assumption 1 that there exists an audit point of Z satisfying time 0 . . . T .

Let SBT be a sequential aggregation tree having a height k. Then i represents a leaf number of SBT. Assume that k k and authPathTk denotes an array of first k elements of authPathTk i where k is the number of elements.

Assume that authPathTk i LR . . . k 1 i k 1 LR k 1 . Additionally let v and v be different hash values. We are given AP and AP as follows 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 . . . 1 1 1 1 1 2 0 2 0 1 1 2 . . . 1 1 2 1 1 . Then it is noted that v k calculated from v and AP as below 1 does not coincide with v k calculated from v and AP as below 2 excepting practically negligible probability.

 1 For each j 0 . . . k v j is recursively defined as 1 0 1. If j 0 and 1 then 1 1 1 1 1 . If j 0 and 1 then 1 1 1 1 1 .

 2 For each j 0 . . . k v j is recursively defined as 2 0 2. If j 0 and 1 then 2 2 1 2 1 . If j 0 and 1 then 2 2 1 2 1 .

Thus 1 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 is satisfied. Also the conditions 1 2 lead to 1 1 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 . Thus 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 0 is satisfied and thus v j v j and v j v j make a collision of the collision resistant hash function h.

 Case 2 This is a case with LR j R. In the same way as case 1 it is led that v j v j and v j v j make a collision of the collision resistant hash function h.

From above the collision of the collision resistant hash function h appears in both cases. Such a situation is not meant to be except a practically negligible probability . Thus a situation of v k v k is not also meant to be except a practically negligible probability .

In connection with the first to third embodiments mentioned above we now describe more practical embodiments of the event ordering certification system and the event ordering certification audit system. Concretely these embodiments are more practical with respect to various conditions about both resource and performance of respective apparatuses forming the above systems and the same of the network connecting the apparatuses mutually. More in detail we now cite an example of certifying the event ordering by using a nonrepeating oriented graph such as tree structure. In order to realize the event ordering certification with scalability such that the event ordering could be accomplished even if the nonrepeating oriented graph cannot be stored in a computer memory any of the apparatuses i.e. an event ordering certification apparatus and related user apparatuses is required to concern the event ordering certification by a method making it unnecessary to extract the nonrepeating oriented graph on the memory. Additionally from the same view of scalability it is required that even if the nonrepeating oriented graph gets large communication traffic between the event ordering certification apparatus and the user apparatuses would not become excessive. If the communication traffic between the apparatuses could be suppressed within the order of a logarithm of the number of nodes belonging to the corresponding nonrepeating oriented graph this requirement would be satisfied. In general there exists a trade off relationship between communication traffic i.e. traffic between memory capacity necessary for realizing a designated function by a computing system connected through a network and apparatuses and individual processing throughput of the apparatuses. Therefore in order to allow a system with a designated function to be applicable under various situations about memory quantity processing capability of the apparatuses and transmission capacity of the network it is valuable to provide an implementation method that a system throughput within a practical range reduces both memory quantity and communication traffic and another implementation method that both memory quantity and communication traffic within their practical ranges reduce the system throughput conversely.

The certification apparatus comprises a transmitting receiving part for transmitting and receiving data to and from the user apparatuses I through the computer network an event ordering request aggregation part for arranging digital data as event ordering requests transmitted from the user apparatuses I with the use of a sequential aggregation tree an event ordering reply drafting part for drafting a certification reply containing the receipt a digital signature drafting part for applying a high intensity digital signature on data where respective contents of a plurality of receipts published for a constant period by the certification apparatus are aggregated thereby forming publication data an electronic information publishing part for publishing the publication data electronically and a memory part for storing the receipts and information about event ordering certification.

As mentioned above the event ordering request aggregation part operates to aggregate the event ordering requests with the use of the sequential aggregation tree. This sequential aggregation tree will be described with reference to . shows one concrete example of a sequential aggregation tree where digital data is sequentially assigned from the left side with time during a certain period e.g. one week a cycle that the certification apparatus publishes coordinated data which will be referred to as sequential aggregation period . Note that the digital data is obtained by calculating all or part of digital data included in the event ordering requests from the users apparatuses I in accordance with a designated sequentially assigned data calculating procedure. Note that the so obtained data e.g. hash values of the digital data included in the event ordering requests will be referred to as sequentially assigned data item . Note that a leaf of the sequential aggregation tree where each event ordering request from the user apparatus I is assigned is also referred to as registration point .

A calculating method of values assigned to respective nodes except leaf in the sequential aggregation tree is as follows. An assigned value of a parent in the sequential aggregation tree is obtained by calculating a hash value as a result of connecting an assigned value H of a left child with an assigned value H of a right child conjunction between a bit row and a bit row and further applying a designated collision resistant one way hash function h. Here the resultant value is expressed by h H H . In this way it is performed to calculate a higher leveled assigned value from lower leveled assigned values finally reaching a highest leveled assigned value namely a root value H.

We now describe an example of a sequential aggregation tree having sixteen leaves as shown in . The number of leaves of the sequential aggregation tree and its height do not become definite unless the sequential aggregation period is completed. Further in the sequential aggregation tree the assignment of values to the leaves is carried out from left in sequence. The assignments of values to nodes higher than level i.e. non leaves are carried out incrementally if possible. Accordingly for a plurality of nodes on the same vertical line of the assignments of values to the nodes are carried out at about the same time in the same processing unit.

Assuming that a node of level j and number i is represented by j i and an assigned value of j i is represented by V j i the concrete example of will be described.

Suppose the hash value to be assigned to a certain leaf is identical to V i.e. a registration point of . In order to calculate a root value H V from this hash value V it has only to link V to V from the left side thereby calculating a hash value h V to the hash value h from the right side thereby calculating a hash value h V to the hash value h from the left side thereby calculating a hash value h and link V to the hash value h from the right side thereby calculating a hash value H V in order. With the above procedure when it becomes possible to calculate the root value H from V and its complementary data e.g. V V V V in this case we can say V links with the root value H through the hash function h . Additionally the complementary data of V in the sequential aggregation tree is given by

where L and R represent to link from the left side in linking two digital data and to link from the right side in linking two digital data respectively.

The event ordering reply drafting part drafts a certification reply containing a receipt EOC y as shown in and sends it to the user apparatus I. The receipt EOC y is constructed so as to contain digital data y sent from a user sequentially assigned data item z calculated from the digital data y by the above mentioned calculation procedure for sequentially assigned data item a sequential aggregation tree number enabling a sequential aggregation tree having the data item z assigned to be identified uniquely a sequential aggregation tree leaf number enabling a sequential aggregation tree leaf having the data item z assigned to be identified uniquely and both positional information and assigned value of sequential aggregation complementary data part SK acquirable at that time. The above data part SK will be referred to as immediate complementary data of registration point .

Again the certification reply is constructed so as to contain the positional information of late complementary data TK of respective registration points of the user apparatus I in the past and their assigned values. Note that the late complementary data TK designates sequential aggregation complementary data which is acquirable after publishing the certification reply in question. In for instance the late complementary data of V is formed by V and V . While V and V constitute the late complementary data that is acquirable on and after an assignment of V . As for one leaf a and another leaf a on the right of the leaf a generally late complementary data of the leaf a determined at the time of completing the assignment of the leaf a will be referred to as complementary data of a at a . In the complementary data of node at node is formed by node .

Referring to we now describe a concrete example of the certification reply in accordance with this embodiment. Note that the format of a certification reply in the embodiment will be referred to as sequence complementary procedure hereinafter. Suppose now the registration points from a certain user apparatus I consist of X node X node X node X node X node and X node .

In the sequence complementary procedure it is executed at respective registration points to return the following data to the user apparatus I.

 1 For the certification reply at the point X there is returned immediate complementary data of the point X i.e. assigned value of node .

 2 For the certification reply at the point X there are returned immediate complementary data of the point X and X s late complementary data at point X i.e. immediate complementary data of X assigned values of nodes X s late complementary data at X assigned values of nodes .

 3 For the certification reply at the point X there are returned immediate complementary data of the point X and X X s late complementary data at point X i.e. immediate complementary data of X assigned values of nodes X s late complementary data at X assigned values of nodes X s late complementary data at X assigned value of node .

 4 For the certification reply at the point X there are returned immediate complementary data of the point X and X X X s late complementary data at point X i.e. immediate complementary data of X assigned values of nodes X s late complementary data at X assigned values of nodes X s late complementary data at X assigned value of node X s late complementary data at X assigned value of node .

Much the same will be true on the points X and X. In this way with respect to a certain registration point the certification reply is formed so as to contain the immediate complementary data of this registration point and the late complementary data data items of respective registration points at the registration point which have been registered before the above registration point in accordance with the sequence complementary procedure. Note that the respective certification replies are managed with respect to each user apparatus I.

The user apparatus I comprises a transmitting receiving part for transferring data to and from the certification apparatus through the computer network an event ordering certification requesting part for performing the event ordering requests containing designated digital data by several times an event ordering certification verifying part for verifying a receipt contained in the certification reply in response to the event ordering request and a memory part for storing the certification reply containing the receipt and the information about event ordering certification.

As a first function of validation the event ordering certification verifying part verifies that the sequential assigned data item is linked with the information published through the digital signature drafting part of the certification apparatus and the electronic information publishing part . In detail it is executed to validate whether a value published as the root value of the sequential aggregation tree coincides with a root value calculated by the user apparatus I or not.

As a second function of validation the event ordering certification verifying part verifies the temporal context of receipts among the user apparatuses I even before the information is published.

The second function of validation will be described with reference to . First we now explain the relationship between a confluent point and an authentication point.

Regarding a leaf a in a certain sequential aggregation tree a path from a to a root of the tree is called root path of a and represented by rtPath a . Additionally a row of sibling nodes for the nodes belonging to rtPath a but the root will be called authentication path and represented by authPath a .

Suppose we are given a certain sequential aggregation tree having two leaves a and a where the leaf a is positioned on the right of the leaf a. Then a point where a path traveling from a to the root intersects with a path traveling from a to the root will be referred to as confluent point between a and a . Additionally a left child of the confluent point will be called authentication point of a by a or a authentication point of a by a . For instance in an authentication point of the registration point X by X is a point . Similarly an authentication point of the registration point X by X is a point .

Suppose two user apparatuses A and B respectively acquire the certification replies of respective registration points by the sequence complementary procedure. In let a a a and af be respective registration points of the user apparatus A and let b be a registration point of the user apparatus B. Note that af is referred to as temporary terminal point and also positioned on the rightmost side of the registration points of the user apparatus A. In there exist the registration point a of the user apparatus A the registration point b of the user apparatus B on the right of the point a and the registration point af of the user apparatus A on the further right of the point b.

Here according to the sequence complementary procedure when the registration point a is positioned on the left of the registration point b a label assigned value of the authentication point is included in a certification reply immediate complementary data of the registration point b. Additionally on and after the event ordering certification process at the registration point b is completed e.g. position of the registration point af the label of the authentication point is included in a label calculable from the late complementary data of the registration point a. Therefore by verifying whether the assigned value of the authentication point calculated from the late complementary data of the registration point a at the registration point af coincides with the assigned value of the authentication point included in the immediate complementary data of the registration point b it is possible to verify the temporal context between the registration point a and the registration point b detail see later mentioned Feature of Sequential Aggregation item 3 .

In if only existing a coincidence about an assigned value V o for an authentication point o of the registration point a by the registration point b in the present sequential aggregation tree at the present moment i.e. at the registration point af it is possible to certify that the registration of the registration point a was carried out in advance of the registration of the registration point b objectively. The event ordering certification verifying part verifies this temporal context due to its operation mentioned later.

Note that the above apparatuses are formed by electronic apparatuses each having a CPU Central Processing Unit having at least a calculating function and a control function a main memory having a function to store programs and data such as RAM Random Access Memory and a secondary memory capable of continuing to memorize data even at powered off such as HD Hard Disc . The operations of the certification apparatus i.e. the event ordering request aggregation part the event ordering reply drafting part the digital signature drafting part and the electronic information publishing part and the operations of the user apparatus I i.e. the event ordering requesting part and the event ordering certification validating part are nothing but respective crystallizations of the above calculating control functions of the above central processing units. Additionally the memory part of the certification apparatus and the memory part of the user apparatus I are equipped with the above mentioned functions of either the main memory or the secondary memory.

In the event ordering certification system constructed above an event ordering certification method and an event ordering certification validation method will be described with reference to . In the figures is a sequence diagram to explain the operation of the certification apparatus to draft a certification reply containing a receipt for one sequential aggregation period by the event ordering certification apparatus . are sequence diagrams to explain the operation of the user apparatus I to perform a second validation for the receipt.

When the user apparatus I sends an event ordering request including digital data y to the event ordering certification apparatus it receives the event ordering request including the digital data y through the transmitting receiving part steps S S .

Next the event ordering request aggregation part calculates a sequentially assigned data item z from the digital data y as partial or all input and further assigns the sequentially assigned data item z to a sequential aggregation tree leaf to construct a sequential aggregation tree incrementally. While the event ordering reply drafting part drafts the certification reply containing the receipt sequence complementary procedure immediate complementary data of a registration point and late complementary data of previous registration points at the above registration point the previous registration points being registered before the above registration point and successively sends the certification reply to the user apparatus through the transmitting receiving part steps S S S .

In this way the user apparatus can acquire the certification reply containing the receipt step S . Subsequently the user apparatus repeats both transmitting of the certification reply at step Sand receiving of the certification reply at step S

In the certification apparatus meanwhile the above mentioned operation is repeated for a constant period for sequential aggregation i.e. sequential aggregation period . When the sequential aggregation period is completed the electronic information publishing part calculates a root value of the sequential aggregation tree and publishes the root value electronically steps S S S .

Referring to the event ordering certification validation method will be described. This corresponds to the second function of validation in the user apparatus I. shows data interaction between the user apparatus A and the user apparatus B. Here the user apparatus A requests judgment of a postpositive point to the user apparatus B. In detail the user apparatus A asks the user apparatus B to judge the ordering of a postpositive receipt after the registration point of a receipt that the user apparatus A did receive.

First the user apparatus A sends a postpositive point judging request to the user apparatus B together with a receipt EOC a for validation i.e. the receipt at a registration point a step S . Receiving the postpositive point judging request the user apparatus B extracts a leaf number n a out of the receipt EOC a and searches a larger leaf number than the leaf number n a from the registration points of the user apparatus B steps S S . If the registration points of the user apparatus B contains at least one registration point each having a leaf number larger than the leaf number n a then the user apparatus B selects one registration point b whose leaf number n b is larger than the leaf number n a and sends the leaf number n b to the user apparatus A steps S S . On the contrary if the registration points of the user apparatus B does not contain a leaf number larger than the leaf number n a user apparatus B sends a message indicating absence of comparable data to the user apparatus A step S .

Receiving the leaf number n b from the user apparatus B the user apparatus A selects a provisional registration point af having a leaf number larger than the leaf number n b acquires late complementary data lateData a af of the registration point a at the provisional registration point af and sends the data lateData a af to the user apparatus B steps S S S S . When receiving the message indicating absence of comparable data from the user apparatus B this validation is finished step S .

After receiving the late complementary data lateData a af from the user apparatus A the user apparatus B calculates an authentication point o of the registration point a by the registration point b from the leaf identifier numbers n a and n b and further calculates an assigned value of the authentication point o from the receipt EOC a and the data lateData a af step S . Next the user apparatus B verifies whether the calculated assigned value is included in late complementary data contained in a receipt EOC b of the registration point b or not. If the assigned value is included the user apparatus B sends a judgment that the registration point a has been registered in advance of the registration point b to the user apparatus A steps S S . On the contrary if the assigned value is not included the user apparatus B sends a judgment that there exists any falseness due to the impossibility of certifying that the registration point a has been registered in advance of the registration point b to the user apparatus A steps S S .

Consequently the user apparatus A can verify the temporal context in publishing the receipt between the user apparatus A and the user apparatus B since the apparatus A acquires the judgment steps S S .

The above mentioned event ordering certification validation method is directed to the request for judgment of the postpositive point from the user apparatus A to the user apparatus B. In the modification the user apparatus A may request judgment of a prepositive point to the user apparatus B. In detail the user apparatus A may ask the user apparatus B to judge the ordering of a prepositive receipt before the registration point of a receipt that the user apparatus A did receive. is a sequence diagram showing data interaction between the user apparatus A and the user apparatus B when the apparatus A requests the judgment of the prepositive point to the apparatus B.

First the user apparatus A sends a prepositive point judging request to the user apparatus B together with the receipt EOC a for validation i.e. the receipt at the registration point a step S . Receiving the prepositive point judging request the user apparatus B extracts the leaf number n a out of the receipt EOC a and searches a smaller leaf number than the leaf number n a and a larger leaf number than the leaf number n a from the registration points of the user apparatus B steps S S . If the registration points of the user apparatus B contains a leaf number smaller than the leaf number n a and a leaf number larger than the leaf number n a then the user apparatus B selects one registration point b whose leaf number n b is smaller than the leaf number n a and another provisional registration point bf whose leaf number n b is larger than the leaf number n a steps S S . On the contrary if the registration points of the user apparatus B contain neither a leaf number smaller than the leaf number n a nor a leaf number larger than the leaf number n a the user apparatus B sends a message indicating absence of comparable data to the user apparatus A step S . When receiving the message indicating absence of comparable data from the user apparatus B the user apparatus A finishes the validation step S .

Next the user apparatus B acquires late complementary data lateData b bf of the registration point b at the provisional registration point bf calculates an authentication point o of the registration point a by the registration point b from the leaf identifier numbers n a and n b and further calculates an assigned value of the authentication point o from the receipt EOC a and the data lateData b bf steps S . Next the user apparatus B verifies whether the calculated assigned value is included in late complementary data contained in a receipt EOC a of the registration point a or not. If the assigned value is included the user apparatus B sends a judgment that the registration point a has been registered after the registration point b to the user apparatus A steps S S . On the contrary if the assigned value is not included the user apparatus B sends a judgment that there exists any falseness due to the impossibility of certifying that the registration point a has been registered after the registration point b to the user apparatus A steps S S .

Consequently the user apparatus A can verify the temporal context in publishing the receipt between the user apparatus A and the user apparatus B since the apparatus A acquires the judgment steps S S .

In the above mentioned event ordering certification validation method the user apparatuses A and B verify the temporal context of the publication of the receipts. The present invention is not limited to this and a third organization other than parties concerned e.g. the event ordering certification audit apparatus of the first to third embodiments may verify the temporal context. In this case the user apparatuses A and B transmit information essential to validation to the third organization where the validation is carried out.

The fourth embodiment will be summarized as follows. In the event ordering certification system for certifying the event ordering with the use of a tree structure the certification apparatus on receipt of an event ordering request from the user apparatus I publishes a certification reply in the sequence complementary method the certification reply containing the immediate complementary data of a registration point and the late complementary data of respective registration points registered before the registration point at the registration point . Therefore it is possible for the user apparatus I to verify the temporal context in publishing respective receipts between the user apparatuses I while using the certification reply. Therefore even if this validation is carried out before publishing data collecting up the event ordering requests is published electronically it is possible to verify the validity of the receipts.

The fifth embodiment differs from the fourth embodiment with respect to the format of certification reply. According to the fifth embodiment the certification reply is drafted in later mentioned chain complementary procedure different from the above sequence complementary procedure. In the sequence complementary procedure mentioned above at each registration point of one user apparatus I the certification apparatus has to return the late complementary data about all past registration points of the relevant use apparatus I to the same apparatus I. Therefore the amount of data for the certification reply increases with an increase in the number of past registration points. On the contrary according to the chain complementary procedure the amount of data of the certification reply is suppressed from increasing. In the fifth embodiment both constitutions and functions different from those in the previous embodiments will be described below. As to the other constitutions and functions their descriptions are eliminated while applying the same reference numerals to the identical elements respectively.

The certification apparatus comprises the transmitting receiving part for transmitting and receiving data to and from the user apparatuses I through the computer network the event ordering request aggregation part for arranging digital data as event ordering requests transmitted from the user apparatuses I with the use of a sequential aggregation tree an event ordering reply drafting part for drafting a certification reply containing a receipt receipt certificate the digital signature drafting part for applying a high intensity digital signature on data where respective contents of a plurality of receipts published for a constant period by the certification apparatus are aggregated thereby forming publication data the electronic information publishing part for electronically publishing the publication data having the high intensity digital signature applied thereon and a memory part for storing the receipts and information about event ordering certification.

The event ordering reply drafting part drafts the certification reply containing a receipt EOC y as shown in and sends it to the user apparatus I. The receipt EOC y is constructed so as to contain digital data y sent from a user sequentially assigned data item z calculated from the digital data y by the above mentioned calculation procedure for sequentially assigned data item a sequential aggregation tree number enabling a sequential aggregation tree having the data item z assigned to be identified uniquely a sequential aggregation tree leaf number enabling a sequential aggregation tree leaf having the data item z assigned to be identified uniquely and both positional information and assigned value of sequential aggregation complementary data part SK acquirable at that time. The above data part SK will be referred to as immediate complementary data of registration point .

Again the certification reply is constructed so as to contain the positional information of late complementary data TK of an immediately preceding registration point of the user apparatus I in the past and their assigned values.

Referring to we now describe a concrete example of the certification reply in accordance with this embodiment Note that the format of the certification reply in the embodiment will be referred to as chain complementary procedure hereinafter. Suppose now the registration points from a certain user apparatus I consist of X node X node X node X node X node and X node .

In the chain complementary procedure it is executed at respective registration points to return the following data to the user apparatus I.

 1 For the certification reply at the point X there is returned immediate complementary data of the point X i.e. assigned value of node .

 2 For the certification reply at the point X there are returned immediate complementary data of the point X and X s late complementary data at point X i.e. immediate complementary data of X respective assigned values of nodes X s late complementary data at X assigned values of nodes .

 3 For the certification reply at the point X there are returned immediate complementary data of the point X and X s late complementary data at point X i.e. immediate complementary data of X assigned values of nodes X s late complementary data at X assigned value of node .

 4 For the certification reply at the point X there are returned immediate complementary data of the point X and X s late complementary data at point X i.e. immediate complementary data of X assigned values of nodes X s late complementary data at X assigned value of node .

Much the same will be true on the points X and X. Therefore according to chain complementary procedure as for a certain registration point the certification reply is formed so as to contain the immediate complementary data of this registration point and the late complementary data data item of an immediately preceding registration point at the above registration point. Consequently as the amount of data in the certification reply against the event ordering request does not increase proportionally in spite of an increase in the number of past registration points it is possible to reduce the amount of communication data between the certification apparatus and the user apparatus I. Note that the respective certification replies are managed with respect to each user apparatus I.

In spite of the certification reply in the chain complementary procedure the user apparatuses I can acquire data identical to the data in the sequence complementary procedure. The reason will be described with reference to .

Assume that we are given a sequential aggregation tree ST where three leaves a a and a are arranged in this order from the left as shown in . Then from the late complementary data of a point a at a point a the immediate complementary data of a and the late complementary data of a at a the late complementary data of a at a is calculated as follows.

First assume that j denotes a level of the highest node in the late complementary data of a at a. Additionally an authentication point of a by a a brotherly node of the authentication point and a level of the brotherly node are presented by AP a a AP a a and j respectively.

On the above assumption it is firstly noted that in authentication path nodes contained the late complementary data of a of a assigned values of nodes of level smaller than j are included in the late complementary data of a at a.

Secondly in the authentication path nodes contained the late complementary data of a of a assigned values of nodes of level equal to j can be calculated by the late complementary data of a at a and the immediate complementary data of a.

Thirdly in the authentication path nodes contained the late complementary data of a of a an aggregate of nodes of level larger than j is identical to an aggregate of nodes of level larger than j in the authentication path nodes contained the late complementary data of a at a. Therefore in the authentication path nodes contained the late complementary data of a at a assigned values of nodes of level larger than j can be calculated by the late complementary data of a at a

Note from above 1 to 3 a process of calculating the late complementary data of a at a will be referred to as propagation procedure for completion hereinafter.

With the use of propagation procedure for completion the user apparatus I can calculate the certification reply in accordance with the sequence complementary procedure from the certification reply in accordance with the chain complementary procedure. is a diagram showing this calculating method. shows the immediate complementary data and the late complementary data essential to respective registration points in both the sequence complementary procedure and the chain complementary procedure. Note that both the immediate complementary data and the late complementary data in the certification replies in the chain complementary procedure are framed in by double line of . In respective arrows designate calculating directions. For instance shows that it is possible to calculate the late complementary data P of a at a from the late complementary data P of a at a the immediate complementary data P of a and the late complementary data P of a at a.

Similarly it is possible to calculate the late complementary data P of a at a from the late complementary data P of a at a the immediate complementary data P of a and the late complementary data P of a at a. Then by repeating this operation it becomes possible to calculate all the late complementary data of in spite of the chain complementary procedure finally. This is no less the late complementary data than the certification replies in the sequence complementary procedure.

Accordingly in spite of the chain complementary procedure of this embodiment the user apparatuses I can carry out the validation similar to the first embodiment due to the propagation procedure for completion as shown in . Note that the propagation procedure for completion will be described as a later mentioned incremental completion in detail.

The user apparatus I comprises the transmitting receiving part for transferring data to and from the certification apparatus through the computer network the event ordering certification requesting part for performing the event ordering requests containing designated digital data by several times an event ordering certification verifying part for verifying a receipt contained in the certification reply in response to the event ordering request and a memory part for storing the information about event ordering certification and the certification reply containing the receipt.

In addition to the function of the event ordering certification verifying part of the fourth embodiment the event ordering certification verifying part has a function of performing the incremental completion mentioned later and includes the following functions of validation against the receipt.

As a first function of validation the event ordering certification verifying part verifies that the sequential assigned data item is linked with the information published through the digital signature drafting part of the certification apparatus and the electronic information publishing part . In detail it is executed to validate whether a value published as the root value of the sequential aggregation tree coincides with a root value calculated by the user apparatus I or not.

As a second function of validation the event ordering certification verifying part verifies the temporal context of receipts among the user apparatuses I even before the information is published.

Suppose two user apparatuses A and B respectively acquire the certification replies of respective registration points by the chain complementary procedure. In let a a a and af be respective registration points of the user apparatus A and let b be a registration point of the user apparatus B. Note that af is referred to as temporary terminal point . In there exist the registration point a of the user apparatus A the registration point b of the user apparatus B on the right of the point a and the registration point af of the user apparatus A on the further right of the point b.

According to the embodiment at first the propagation procedure for completion of is applied to the registration point a of the user apparatus A while establishing af as the temporary terminal point. Consequently the certification reply identical to that of the sequence complementary procedure is obtained. Subsequently by carrying out the same method as the fourth embodiment it is possible verify the temporal context between the registration point a and the registration point b. Thus also in this embodiment if only there is a coincidence about an assigned value V o for an authentication point o of the registration point a by the registration point b in the present sequential aggregation tree at the present moment i.e. at the registration point af it is possible to verify that the registration of the registration point a was carried out in advance of the registration of the registration point b objectively.

Note that the above apparatuses are formed by electronic apparatuses each having a CPU Central Processing Unit having at least a calculating function and a control function a main memory having a function to store programs and data such as RAM Random Access Memory and a secondary memory capable of continuing to memorize data even at powered off such as HD Hard Disc . The operation of the event ordering reply drafting part in the certification apparatus and the operation of the event ordering certification verifying part of the user apparatus I are nothing but respective crystallizations of the above calculating control functions of the above central processing units. Additionally the memory part of the certification apparatus and the memory part of the user apparatus I are equipped with the above mentioned functions of either the main memory or the secondary memory.

As for the event ordering certification method in the event ordering certification system constructed above the description of the method is eliminated due to the identity achieved by replacing the certification apparatus and the user apparatuses I of with the certification apparatus and the user apparatuses I respectively. As for the method for varidation of event ordering certificates there is no difference between the fourth embodiment and the fifth embodiment but replacing the user apparatuses A B of by the user apparatuses A B respectively. Further if only executing a later mentioned incremental completion process in each of the user apparatuses A and B as an advance step subsequent operations of the apparatuses A and B would be the same as those of . Therefore an explanation about the method for varidation of event ordering certificates is eliminated.

The data storing method of the certification apparatus in the chain complementary procedure will be described in detail. First the first method is a method A of accomplishing the above mentioned chain complementary procedure since the certification apparatus builds a sequential aggregation tree on the memory part

According to the method A it is carried out to add a node at level i.e. a leaf to the sequential aggregation tree on the memory part whenever the certification apparatus receives an event ordering request. Additionally for a node more than level whose assigned value is calculable the certification apparatus adds the node and the assigned value to the sequential aggregation tree.

The operation of the certification apparatus in the method A will be described with reference to . is a flow chart showing the functions of the event ordering request aggregation part and the event ordering reply drafting part

First when receiving an event ordering request from the user apparatus I the certification apparatus drafts a sequentially assigned data item from the event ordering request assigns the data item to a new leaf of the sequential aggregation tree to make a new registration point and stores node information positional information and the assigned value about the new registration point steps S S .

Next in accordance with the definition of immediate complementary data the certification apparatus acquires immediate complementary data of the new registration point from the sequential aggregation tree stored in the memory part step S .

Next for a node at level more than 1 whose assigned value becomes calculable as a result of the addition of the new registration point the certification apparatus calculates the assigned value and stores the positional information of the node and the assigned value in the memory part step S .

Next in accordance with the definition of late complementary data the certification apparatus acquires late complementary data of an immediately preceding registration point from the immediately preceding registration point with respect to each user apparatus I and the sequential aggregation tree stored in the memory part step S .

Next the certification apparatus replaces the immediately preceding registration point with the new registration point and stores it as an immediately preceding registration point for the user apparatus I drafts a certification reply including the immediate complementary data and the late complementary data acquired at steps Sand S and sends the certification reply to the user apparatus I steps S S S .

The second method is a method of accomplishing the above mentioned chain complementary procedure by the certification apparatus s forming a stack structure in the memory part in place of the formation of a sequential aggregation tree on the memory part . The second method will be referred to as method B hereinafter. The method B is directed to an improvement of the above mentioned method A where necessary memory capacity increases in substantially proportional to the size of the sequential aggregation tree. Thus according to the method B since respective assigned values for the nodes in the sequential aggregation tree the immediate complementary data for each event ordering request and the late complementary data are calculated by using the stack structure it is possible to reduce the necessary memory capacity allowing a handling of a sequential aggregation tree whose size is so large that the memory part cannot store.

In the above stacks the first stack is provided with data structure used up to now. For instance R. Markle discloses one recursive procedure H a b for calculating an assigned value for a root node of a binary tree see Secrecy Authentication and Public Key System UMI Research Press 1982 page 36 . When applying this recursive procedure H a b on one stack for its standard packaging this stack will be treated in the similar way as the above first stack.

The operation of the certification apparatus in the method B will be described with reference to . is a flow chart showing the functions of the event ordering request aggregation part and the event ordering reply drafting part

First when receiving an event ordering request from the user apparatus I the certification apparatus drafts a sequentially assigned data item from the event ordering request and assigns the data item to a new leaf of the sequential aggregation tree to make a new registration point steps S S .

Next the certification apparatus acquires the immediate complementary data of the new registration point from the first stack step S .

Next it is carried out to add a stack frame including the positional information of the new registration point and its assigned value to the first stack step S . At this time if the above stack frame corresponds to the complementary data for an immediately preceding registration point in any one of the other user apparatuses I the stack frame is added to the second stack of the relevant user apparatus I steps S S .

Next so long as the first stack includes two stack frames corresponding to two nodes as the brotherly nodes the certification apparatus produces a stack frame including the positional information about a parent node for the two nodes above and its assigned value next deletes the stack frames corresponding to the two nodes from the first stack and instead adds the so produced new stack frame to the first stack steps S S . At this time if the new stack frame corresponds to the complementary data for an immediately preceding registration point in any one of the other user apparatuses I the stack frame is added to the second stack of the relevant user apparatus I steps S S .

Next the certification apparatus acquires the late complementary data of the immediately preceding registration point at the new registration point from the second stack for the relevant user apparatus and simultaneously empties the second stack step S .

Next the certification apparatus replaces the immediately preceding registration point with the new registration point and stores it as an immediately preceding registration point for the relevant user apparatus I drafts a certification reply including the immediate complementary data and the late complementary data acquired at steps Sand S and sends the certification reply to the user apparatus I steps S S S .

The above mentioned operation will be described with a concrete example of in detail. Suppose that X denotes a new registration point.

First when receiving an event ordering request from the user apparatus I the certification apparatus drafts a sequentially assigned data item from the event ordering request and assigns the data item to a new leaf i.e. the registration point X of the sequential aggregation tree to make the new registration point steps S S .

Next it is carried out to acquire an assigned value for node being the immediate complementary data of the new registration point X from a stack frame of the first stack an assigned value for node from a stack frame of the first stack and an assigned value for node from a stack frame of the first stack respectively step S .

Next a stack frame including the positional information about the new registration point and its assigned value is added to the first stack step S . Then if the stack frame newly added to the first stack corresponds to the complementary data for an immediately preceding registration point in any one of the other user apparatuses I the same stack frame is added to the second stack of the relevant user apparatus I steps S S .

Next since the first stack includes two stack frames and corresponding to the brotherly nodes the certification apparatus produces a stack frame including the positional information about node corresponding a parent node of the two nodes and its assigned value next deletes stack frames and corresponding to the brotherly nodes from the first stack and adds the so produced new stack frame to the first stack as a new stack frame steps S S . At this time if the stack frame newly added to the first stack corresponds to the complementary data for an immediately preceding registration point in any one of the other user apparatuses I the stack frame is added to the second stack of the relevant user apparatus I steps S S .

Next it is carried out to acquire an assigned value for node which is the late complementary data of the immediately preceding registration point X at the new registration point X from the stack frame of the second stack for the relevant user apparatus I and simultaneously empty the second stack step S .

Next it is carried out to replace the immediately preceding registration point X with the new registration point X and store it as an immediately preceding registration point for the relevant user apparatus I draft a certification reply including the immediate complementary data and the late complementary data acquired at steps Sand S and send the certification reply to the user apparatus I steps S S S .

We now explain one packaging example when the certification apparatus using the second method drafts a certification reply.

The terminology  chain comple data vec designates an array of data structure chain comple data . The data structure chain comple data comprises a late comple stack part a prev point part a prev point old part and an old tree id part. The late comple stack part has a stack structure of stack frames as similar to the  stack. The prev point part represents an identification number nonnegative integer or nil showing an immediately preceding point. The prev point old part represents an identification number nonnegative integer or nil showing an immediately preceding point in a sequential aggregation tree produced in advance of the present sequential aggregation tree. The old tree id part represents an identification number nonnegative integer or nil of a sequential aggregation tree to which a registration point indicated with the prev point old part belongs when the prev point old part is not nil.

On establishment of V as the digital data from a demander and id as an identification number of the demander whenever the certification apparatus receives an event ordering request this procedure is called out steps STto ST .

Referring to we now describe a sequential aggregation tree changing process of completing to form a sequential aggregation tree on completion of one aggregating period and successively initializing to form a next sequential aggregation tree for a next aggregation period.

In the subroutine TERMINATE STREE SUB of there are is executed to add nodes as occasion demands on a basis of a sequential aggregation tree under construction at the point of completing the aggregation period assign designated hash values to these nodes in accordance with a predetermined procedure and further define a root value of the relevant sequential aggregation tree.

Referring to the operation of TERMINATE STREE SUB will be described in response to a specific situation in detail. Suppose a situation where the aggregation period has finished after completing the process of a leaf identification number ID. No. and before staring the process of a leaf ID. No. and therefore the operation of TERMINATE STREE SUB is called out. It is noted that  stack contains V and V in view from top. Owing to the operation of TERMINATE STREE SUB it becomes possible to assign dummy hash values to nodes and thereby determining a root value of this sequential aggregation tree and simultaneously possible to define the perfect authentication path data i.e. an aggregate of authentication path nodes allowing calculation of a root value as follows.

 1 At step ST it is executed to set V to the local variable sfml xb so that  stack contains V only. Next at step ST it is executed to set to the local variable place xb and 4 to the local variable idx xb.

At step ST it is executed to judge whether the idx xb is an even number or an odd number. In this case because of 4 the routine goes to step ST

At step ST it is executed to judge whether the  stack is nil or not. In this case as the  stack is not nil the routine goes to step ST

At step ST it is executed to set to the local variable lev xb V to val xb and set 1 4 to idx . Further lev xb idx  1 5 is set to place . This positional information represents a first dummy node. Then it is executed to call out a function dummy hash to calculate a hash value to be assigned to the first dummy node and further executed to set its return value to dum val  . Additionally it is executed to set sfml  as

Here make stackflm is a function of producing a stack frame while setting the positional information about node and its hash value as arguments. Here while setting place and sfml as arguments there is called out REGISTER COMPLE DATA defined with .

At next step S it is executed to set to lev nw floor idx xb floor 2 to idex nw and set to place nw . In succession it is executed to set hash comb val xb dum val  to val nw . On establishment of two hash values as arguments hash comb is a function of returning a result of applying a designated hash function to a junction between these hash values. Setting make stackflm place nw val nw to sflm nw sflm nw is pushed against  stack . Consequently  stack has a structure including V and V . Further setting both place nw and sflm nw as arguments there is called out REGISTER COMPLE DATA. Then the routine is returned to step S

 2 At step ST it is execute to pop  stack by one and set V to sflm xb Here the state of  stack becomes V . . Additionally it is executed to set and 2 to place xb and idx xb respectively.

At step S it is judged that the value idx xb of 2 is an even number and successively the routine goes to step S. As the value  stack is not nil the routine goes to step S. At this step there are established 2 for lev xb V for val13 for idx1 for place1 and a return value of dummy hash for dum val1 respectively. Assume that this return value of dummy hash is represented by V . Further it is executed to set make stackflm place1 dum val1 V to sflm1 . Here setting both place1 and sflm1 as arguments there is called out REGISTER COMPLE DATA.

Next at step ST it is executed to set to lev nw floor val xb floor 1 to idex nw and set to place nw . In succession it is executed to set hash comb val xb dum val1 to val nw . This value is represented by V . Setting make stackflm V to sflm nw sflm nw is pushed against  stack . Consequently stack has a structure including V and V . Further setting both place nw and sflm nw as arguments there is called out REGISTER COMPLE DATA. Then the routine is returned to step S

 3 At step ST it is execute to pop  stack by one and set V to sflm xb Here the state of  stack becomes V . . Additionally it is executed to set and 1 to place xb and idx xb respectively.

At step S it is judged that the value idx xb of I is an odd number and successively the routine goes to step S. At this step there are established 3 for lev xb and V for val1 respectively. It is execute to pop  stack by one and further establish so popped V to sflm . Further there are established place0 of lev0 of 0 idx0 of 0 and val0 of V respectively.

Next at step ST it is executed to set to lev nw floor 0 to idex nw and set to place nw . In succession it is executed to set hash comb V V to val nw . This value is represented by V . Setting make stackflm V to sfml nw sfml nw is pushed against  stack . Consequently  stack has a structure including V . Further setting both place nw and sflm nw as arguments there is called out REGISTER COMPLE DATA. Then the routine is returned to step S

 4 At step ST it is execute to pop  stack by one and set V to sflm xb Here the state of  stack becomes nil. . Additionally it is executed to set and 0 to place xb and idx xb respectively. At step S it is judged that the value idx xb of 0 is an even number and successively the routine goes to step S. As the value  stack is nil the routine goes to step Sto set V as a return value and thereafter the routine is ended.

Consequently the return value in this procedure becomes V that is a root value of the relevant sequential aggregation tree.

It is executed to set  chain comple data vec id to chain comple data and further set prev point part of chain comple data to prev chain point step ST 

If not there are established prev chain point for prev point old part of chain comple data nil for prev point part the present sequential aggregation tree for old tree part respectively. Next chain comple data is set to  chain comple data vec id step ST .

Next the incremental completion in each user apparatus I will be described in detail. The incremental completion is roughly classified to 1 incremental individual completion and 2 incremental aggregate completion either of which is carried out by the user apparatus I. Note that the above mentioned propagation procedure of completion relates to an explanation of one function of the incremental aggregate completion.

Assume that a registration point af is a provisional terminal point that belongs a certain aggregation interval I of the user apparatus A or coincides with a first registration point in the next aggregation interval.

In case of the first registration point in the next aggregation interval to the certain aggregation interval af will be referred to as postscript point to the relevant aggregation interval .

Assume that an aggregate of registration points registered till the provisional terminal point af during the aggregation interval I is represented by a a . . . a n . Note although there is normally established a n af this relationship is not realized in case of af of a postscript point. 

Then by the aggregate of registration points one or more sequential aggregation small trees are formed with the provisional terminal point of af . This aggregate of sequential aggregation small trees will be referred to as sequential aggregation forest having the provisional terminal point af after.

When af is in the relevant aggregation interval it is assumed that af represents a leaf number nonnegative integer and that 1 stands at k k . . . k m digit in the binary coded notation of af . However the minimum digit is established as 0 digit. In m is set to 4 m 4 . Here k m may be equal to 0. The relationship of k k k . . . k m has to be established. Then the number of leaves in the n. sequential aggregation small tree belonging to the above sequential aggregation forest amounts to 2. In ST . . . ST denote sequential aggregation small trees.

The incremental individual completion is to perform the following calculations 1 to 3 for designated a a a . . . a n 

 2 Calculating of one or more assigned values for one or more roots of one or more sequential aggregation small trees positioned on the left of the above ST in the sequential aggregation forest from the complementary data at the leaves a . . . a n and af and

 3 Calculating of assigned values of nodes belonging to authPathST a from the complementary data at the leaves a . . . a n and af . Here authPathST a represents an authentication path of a in ST.

Note that the definition of incremental individual completion may be accomplished with the use of a present moment sequential aggregation tree defined as follows. In connection with the present moment sequential aggregation tree a minimum binary tree including a sequential aggregation tree having the provisional terminal point af will be referred to as present moment sequential aggregation tree having the provisional terminal point af after.

Note that if the total number of leaves in the sequential aggregation forest is represented by N a height h of the sequential aggregation tree at the present moment becomes a minimum nonnegative integer k satisfying N 2.

Returning to for explanation of the second validation function in the light of the above mentioned argument when performing the incremental individual completion with af as the provisional terminal point against the registration point a it becomes possible to calculate an assigned value V o for an authentication point o. Consequently if the immediate complementary data acquired at the registration point b contains the calculated assigned value V o for an authentication point o of the registration point a by the registration point b in the present moment sequential aggregation tree having the registration point af as the present moment the it is possible to certify that the registration of the registration point a occurred in advance of the registration of the registration point b.

Next referring to the operation of incremental individual completion will be described. is a flow chart showing the operation of incremental individual completion.

First it is executed to indicate one registration point a which precedes the provisional registration point af and belongs to the aggregation interval I step S . In a sequential aggregation forest of a leaf with index i.e. node constitutes a.

Next it is executed to calculate the sequential aggregation small tree ST to which the registration point a step S . In the sequential aggregation forest shown in the second sequential aggregation small tree ST from the left constitutes the tree ST.

Next it is executed to calculate respective late authentication path nodes s of the registration point a in the tree ST step S . In the sequential aggregation forest of . Both leaf node of index and node of index at level form the late authentication path nodes.

Next it is executed to determine acquisitive reference points of the respective late authentication path nodes s step S . Now we describe the acquisitive reference points and acquisitive timing points. Note that in the following descriptions a combination between the immediate complementary data of a certain registration point a and the late complementary data of the point a acquired at the next registration point a will be referred to as chain complementary data of the registration point a hereinafter.

If a registration point a is given a requested registration point that allows information enough to calculate an assigned value V j s j of a node j s j at level j in the authPath a to be acquired from either its complementary data or a calculation based on the complementary data will be referred to as acquisitive reference point of V j s j . Then we refer to a registration point to receive the above necessary complementary data as acquisitive timing point .

For instance if a registration point X is given in the sequential aggregation tree of the acquisitive reference point of a node being one of the late complementary data becomes a registration point X node while the acquisitive timing point becomes a registration point X node . Again if the registration point X is given the acquisitive reference point and acquisitive timing point of a node being one of the immediate complementary data become a registration point X node . As for the immediate complementary data generally the acquisitive reference point coincides with the acquisitive timing point.

Next based on the acquisitive reference point determined at step S it is executed to calculate assigned value for the respective authentication path nodes s step S .

In this way the procedure for incremental completion at the registration point a is completed. When applying a collision resistant hash function on an input containing the assigned value for the registration point a with the use of the above calculation result it becomes possible to calculate V root ST . Note that the possibility of the above mentioned calculation is based on the premise that both of the acquisitive reference point of each path node s and the acquisitive timing point are together positioned formerly of the provisional registration point af

Inputting the leaf identifier a nonnegative integer and the identifier fin nonnegative integer of the provisional terminal point and further assuming that ST represents a sequential aggregation small tree containing a and also belonging to the sequential aggregation tree at the point of completing the registration of the provisional terminal point this algorithm outputs the leftmost leaf identifier start nonnegative integer and the rightmost leaf identifier last nonnegative integer in pairs. The number of leaves in the relevant sequential aggregation small tree amounts to last start 1 and the height of the relevant sequential aggregation small tree becomes log last start 1 .

The concrete example of on application of the procedure of is as follows. Let the leaf identifier a and the identifier fin of the provisional terminal point be 18 and 26 respectively. Then the calculation in accordance with the procedure of allows 16 to be returned as start while 23 to be returned as last . From these outputs it will be found that a sequential aggregation small tree to which a belongs is the tree ST in .

Next with reference to we describe grounds for algorithm of the procedure DECIDE GET POINT A of deciding the acquisitive reference point of the authentication path node assigned value in the incremental completion of .

Assume here that a sequential aggregation small tree that a belongs to which is one of small trees in the completed forest having the provisional terminal point of af is represented by ST a leafs ST .

Further the authentication path of a in the small tree ST is represented by authPathST a where authPath 0 0 0 1 1 . . . 1 1 . Note that is a height of the sequential aggregation small tree ST that a in the completed forest belongs to. That is k height ST . In the following descriptions for nonnegative integers n and m it is assumed that n . . . m represents an aggregate of integers more than n and less than m.

For each j 0 . . . k 1 the algorithm to decide which of requested registration points does provide j s j through its complementary data will be shown below.

 1 If a node j r j is a left child of j 1 r j 1 then s j r j 1 while a node j s j becomes a right child of j 1 r j 1 . A rightmost point in the requested registration points belonging to leafs subTree j r j is calculated and represented by a .

 1 1 If a af it is assumes that the next requested registration point to a is represented by a there exists such a where a af because a af .

 1 1 1 If a leafs subTree j s j a rightmost point in the requested registration points belonging to leafs subTree j s j is represented by a .

 1 1 1 1 If a last leafs subTree j s j see the immediate complementary data immedData a contains complete complementary data cmpltDATA subTree j s j a of the point a in a tree subTree j s j . Thus immedData a3 V j s j is established. Note that X Y represents that Y can be calculated from X. 

Then both the acquisitive reference point and the acquisitive timing point of V j s j may be set to a together.

 1 1 1 2 1 If a af see the next requested registration point to a is represented by a there exists such a where a af because a af. The point a may be a postscript point. .

Thus by the feature of a sequential aggregation tree V j s j can be calculated from the immediate complementary data acquired at a and the late complementary data for a acquired at a . That is immedData a3 lateData a3 a4 V j s j is established. Provided that a is an authentication point of a by a V a is included in the immediate complementary data immedData a . However it should be noted that it does not necessarily mean that V a coincides with V j s j . 

Then the acquisitive reference point of V j s j and its acquisitive timing point may be set to a and a respectively. Then a af and a af.

Then in the completed forest having the provisional terminal point of af there is no sequential aggregation small tree containing j s j .

The acquisitive reference point of V j s j may be set to a while setting the acquisitive timing point V j s j to a .

Then in the completed forest having the provisional terminal point of af there is no sequential aggregation small tree containing j s j .

 2 If a node j r j is a right child of j 1 r j 1 see then r j s j 1 while a node j s j becomes a left child of j 1 r j 1 .

Both the acquisitive reference point of V j s j and the acquisitive timing point may be set to a together. Then a af.

From above since the procedure DECIDE GET POINT A of deciding the acquisitive reference point of the authentication path node assigned value in the incremental completion of is formed by steps on consideration of all situations it is found that the algorithm of is reasonable.

Each element forming the array has a structure of chaindata defined with . In the array an i. element contains the immediate complementary data of an i. registration point in the relevant aggregation period and the late complementary data of the i. registration point which is acquired at a registration point just behind the i. registration point.

 1 It is executed to establish an integer i representing an index of the array chaindata store as the first argument and an integer j representing level of a sequential aggregation tree as the second argument step S .

 2 It is executed to establish chaindata store i for the local variable chaindata step S leaf index part of chaindata for the local variable a step S and establish indexes of respective nodes at level j in authPath a for the variable a step S .

 3 In accordance with the above procedure DECIDE GET POINT A described with it is executed to determine an acquisitive reference point a of V j a j step S . Note that a is one of registration points which allows a calculating of V j a j from the chain complementary data acquired at the one registration point.

 4 It is executed to search the array chaindata store and decide an integer i forming the index of an array element whose leaf index part is a step S .

 6 It is executed to establish rgt val part of chaindata for the variable rgt val immediate part of chaindata for the variable immedData and establish late part of chaindata for the variable lateData step S .

 7 It is executed to judge whether a stack frame having its place part of j a is included in any one of rgt val immedData or lateData or not step S .

 7 2 If not included it is executed to calculate assigned values of nodes from level up to level j which are calculable from both immedData and lateData through a hash function sequentially step S .

 7 2 1 It is executed to judge whether V j a j is included in the above calculated assigned values or not step S .

First it is executed to calculate assigned values of respective nodes belonging to authPath a by applying the procedure COMPLETION SUB of on each j 0 j

Next it is executed to establish the array auth node vals as return values and the routine is ended step S .

The above mentioned incremental completion is a method of designating a receipt as an object for completion and further accomplishing an individual completion of the designated receipt. The following incremental completion is a method of designating a series of receipts acquired in sequence by one user apparatus I in block and further calculating the same data as those of the above incremental individual completion. This kind of incremental completion will be referred to as incremental bulk completion hereinafter. That is the incremental bulk completion is to calculate the same data as those calculated by the above incremental individual completion against all of successive registration points a a . . . a n .

The incremental bulk completion can be accomplished by the following procedure adopting the above mentioned propagation procedure for completion.

 1 Assume that a . . . a n constitute a series of registration points belonging to a certain aggregation period I by a certain user apparatus I.

 2 Let af denotes the next registration point to a n of the user apparatus I. The point af may be a postscript point.

 3 According to the procedure COMPLETION BULK BACKWARD of it is executed to apply the incremental completion on a a n . . . a in this order.

By mathematical induction it is certified that the above procedure allows the incremental individual completion to be accomplished for such a situation that af as the provisional terminal point is established to each registration point a n i where i 0 . . . n as follows see . In the following description for the sake of simplicity it is supposed that a . . . a n belong to a common sequential aggregation small tree ST while af is positioned on the left of respective leaves of ST. Note that much the same is true on a general case.

For each i 0 . . . n it has only to certify a combination between the late complementary data of a n i containing additions by the procedure COMPLETION BULK BACKWARD and the immediate complementary data at a n i includes assigned values for all authentication path nodes of a n i in the tree ST.

Suppose that i 0. Then a n i a n . By the procedure COMPLETION BULK BACKWARD a n is tacked on the late complementary data of a n at the completion of a registration process of a n step Sof . Here as a root value of the sequential aggregation small tree has already become definite at the completion of the registration process of a n the combination between the late complementary data of a n i containing additions by the procedure COMPLETION BULK BACKWARD and the immediate complementary data at a n i includes the assigned values for all authentication path nodes of a n in the tree ST.

If given i 0 . . . n 1 and i i it is presumed that the combination between the late complementary data of a n i containing additions by the procedure COMPLETION BULK BACKWARD and the immediate complementary data at a n i includes the assigned values for all authentication path nodes of a n i in the tree ST. In this case it has only to certify that the same is applicable to i i 1. It is possible to certify this applicability by using the propagation procedure for completion as follows.

Assume that a a n i and a a n i 1 . Further let AP a a be an authentication point of a by a. Further brotherly nodes of the authentication point are represented by AP a a . Let j denotes a level of AP a a see .

In the authentication path nodes of a in the small tree ST due to the feature of a sequential aggregation tree mentioned below assigned values for nodes whose level is less than j are included in data added at step Sof .

In the authentication path nodes of a in the small tree ST assigned values for nodes whose level is equal to j are included in data added at step Sof .

In the authentication path nodes of a in the small tree ST assigned values for nodes whose level is more than j are included in data added at step Sof .

From above it is elicited that the combination between the late complementary data of a a n i 1 containing additions by the procedure COMPLETION BULK BACKWARD and the immediate complementary data at a n i 1 includes the assigned values for all authentication path nodes of a n i 1 in the tree ST.

From the above 1 and 2 it becomes obvious that for each i 0 . . . n the combination between the late complementary data of a n i containing additions by the procedure COMPLETION BULK BACKWARD and the immediate complementary data at a n i includes assigned values for all authentication path nodes of a n i in the tree ST.

Note that by the similar inductive method it is obvious that there is no possibility of a judgment of NO at step Scausing an output of error .

The above descriptions are directed to a processing method in a situation such that it is possible to allow the computer to store data that the user apparatus has acquired as the event ordering certification during one aggregation interval by the chain complementary method in a memory of the computer. On the contrary if the acquisition data cannot be stored in the memory of the computer due to weight of numbers of registration points acquired by the user apparatus I during the aggregation period it is possible to calculate the complete authentication path data about all of the registration points during the relevant aggregation period by firstly reading part of the acquisition data into the memory and secondly calculating the complete authentication path data in incremental steps in accordance with a method described below.

 1 Extract and thin out only specific data from complementary data that a certain user apparatus I has received during a certain aggregation interval the specific data each having a registration point whose index meets a specified condition to form thinned out extraction data.

Upon designating a positive integer m for sampling interval as the specified condition for extraction it may be carried out to extract only the specific data each having a registration point whose index is dividable by m. In a concrete example of upon designating 5 for sampling interval only registration points having indexes dividable by 5 are extracted from the registration points having indexes from to shown with black circles . In this case the registration points of indexes are extracted to form the above thinned out extraction data.

 2 Form local data. The local data is composed of both registration value and complementary data about a registration point whose index is interposed between adjoining thinned out extraction data. In general the local data is provided in plural.

In a concrete example of there are collected registration points having indexes each interposed between the index of the first thinned out extraction data and the index of the second thinned out extraction data in order to form the first local data. In a concrete example of there are collected registration points having indexes each interposed between the index of the second thinned out extraction data and the index of the third thinned out extraction data in order to form the second local data.

 3 Apply the above incremental completion on the respective local data formed at 2 while handling a rightmost registration point of each local data as the provisional terminal point. This application of incremental completion will be referred to as local completion for local data after.

Using the late complementary data calculated in the above process it is assumed that a rightmost point of respective registration points belonging to local data in question is represented by a and that an authentication point of a i.e. the respective registration points by a is represented by AP a a . Then in the authentication path nodes of a it is possible to calculate assigned values for nodes lower than level AP a a . Further the so calculated assigned values of the nodes contain all of assigned values that have become definite at the completion of the processing of a in the authentication path nodes of a. That is the so calculated assigned values contain the late complementary data of the registration point a at a.

In the concrete example of there are calculated assigned values for node and node as the late complementary data of the registration point numbered index an assigned value for node as the late complementary data of the registration point numbered index and an assigned value for node as the late complementary data of the registration point numbered index by the above local completion for local data.

Assuming that the rightmost point index of respective registration points belonging to the relevant local data is represented by a it is possible to calculate assigned values for nodes lower than level AP a a in the respective registration points a belonging to the local data. For instance if a is a registration point of index then AP a a becomes allowing a calculation of assigned values of nodes which are lower than level . Since the late complementary data of a at a comprises assigned values for nodes it will be understood that it is possible to calculate the late complementary data at a. Much the same is true on other registration points belonging to this local data.

As a result of the processing of the above section 3 about two adjoining registration points a and a in the thinned out extraction data it is possible to acquire the late complementary data of a at a. By applying the above main routine COMPLETION MAIN  for completing a certificate on the late complementary data it is executed to complete certificates acquired at respective registration points contained in the thinned out extraction data namely calculating of assigned values of all of the authentication path nodes of these registration points. This operation will be referred to as global completion for thinned out extraction data after.

In a concrete example of when completing certificates of registration points in the thinned out extraction data numbered indexes and in other words the registration points of leaf numbers and it is possible to calculate assigned values of all of the authentication path nodes of three registration points. For instance as for one registration point in the thinned out extraction data numbered index it is possible to calculated assigned values for nodes and .

 5 Using each of the local data subjected to the local completion of the above section 3 and the thinned out extraction data subjected to the global completion of the above section 4 it is performed to complete certificates of respective registration points contained in local data in question. This operation will be referred to as global completion for local data hereinafter.

 5 1 Suppose that registration points of certain local data is formed by a a . . . a n a. Then assigned values for all authentication path nodes of a have been already calculated at step 4 . Assume that these assigned values are represented by V V . . . V k 1 

 5 2 Thus it is possible to calculate assigned values of respective nodes belonging to the root path of a. Assume that these assigned values are represented by V V . . . V k 1 V k 

 5 3 For each a a . . . a n 1 it is assumed that an authentication point of a by a is represented by AP a a and k level AP a a n 

 5 4 In the authentication path nodes of a assigned values for nodes whose level is smaller than k have been already calculated by step 3 .

 5 5 Further the authentication path node at level k of a coincide with a node at level k belonging to the root path of a. Accordingly an assigned value of such an authentication path node becomes V k by the calculation at 5 2 .

 5 6 For j satisfying k j k the authentication path node at level j of a coincide with a node at level j belonging to the root path of a. Accordingly an assigned value of the authentication path node becomes V j by the calculation at 5 1 .

In this way by 5 1 to 5 6 it is possible to calculate the assigned values of all authentication path nodes of a with respect to each a a . . . a n 1 .

As for the concrete example of the authentication path nodes of a registration point numbered index leaf ID No. comprises nodes and . If a is a registration point numbered index leaf ID No. then AP a a 3 0 and k level AP a a 3. In the authentication path nodes of a assigned values for nodes and at each level smaller than k 3 can be calculated at the above step 5 3 see . Additionally an assigned value for an authentication path node at level k 3 can be calculated at the above step 5 2 see . An assigned value for a node at level more than k 3 can be calculated at the step 5 1 see .

Owing to the procedure of the above steps 1 to 5 indispensable data that a memory has to retain simultaneously in view of accomplishing the completion of acquired certificates is the thinned out extraction data and the single local data only. Assuming that the total number of registration points is represented by N and the thinned out interval used at the step 1 is represented by m then the number of indispensable registration points that a memory has to retain simultaneously becomes N m m. If m square root over N then there is established N m m 2 square root over N allowing the order of necessary memory capacity to be reduced from N to square root over N.

Next the root value calculation of the user apparatus I by the complementary data will be described. This is a detailed explanation about root value calculation by the first validation function of the user apparatus I.

When a certain aggregation interval I comes to an end the user apparatus I can calculate complete authentication path data with its executing of the individual completion of a receipt in response to one event ordering request RQ that the apparatus I sent during the aggregation interval I in accordance with the above mentioned method. From the so calculated complete authentication path data it is possible to further calculate an assigned value for a root of a sequential aggregation tree for the relevant aggregation interval in accordance with the steps 1 to 5 as below.

It is firstly noted that the complete authentication path data consists of both immediate complementary data and late complementary data. Assume that each of the immediate complementary data and the late complementary data consists of complementary data elements in the form of positional information LR tag assigned value hash value . Note that either tag of L or tag of R is selected in the term of LR tag . The above positional information contains level information. Assume that there is defined among the level information a binary relationship 

About a voluntary registration point it is assumed that complementary data elements contained in the authentication path data are represented by.

where i 1 . . . n. Additionally assume the level information contained in the positional information P i is represented by level P i . Then it is assumed that the binary relationship 

Suppose the positional information consists of a combination of level represented by a nonnegative integer in one sequential aggregation tree with in level index and additionally the level information of the positional information coincides with a first element in the combination. In this case it has only to select an integer magnitude relation 

Referring to we now describe a case of adopting as one leaf of a sequential aggregation tree in a certain aggregation interval a root value of another sequential aggregation tree completed in the previous aggregation interval. In such a case it is possible to verify the temporal context in publishing receipts between different sequential aggregation trees with ease. In for instance when a registration point a of a user apparatus A is assigned to one leaf of a partial tree ST of a sequential aggregation tree ST and when a registration point of a user apparatus B is assigned to one leaf of a partial tree ST of a sequential aggregation tree ST the confluent point between a and b becomes a node R while the authentication point of a by b becomes a node R . Accordingly if a value of the authentication point R calculated from the registration point a is included in the immediate complementary data at the registration point b then it becomes possible to certify that the registration of the point a occurred in advance of the registration of the point b.

Here it is noted that a root R n 1 is a node in common with one sequential aggregation tree ST n 1 and another sequential aggregation tree ST n which is characterized by 

Note that the above level information consists of LR tag nonnegative integer tree number nonnegative integer in tree level information . As for the term of LR tag either tag of L or tag of R is selected.

Here j and i are nonnegative integers. The positional information of each element forming Leafs ST can be represented by R TD n 0 i .

A binary tree composed the sequential aggregation small tree ST the root R n 1 and the root R n is represented by ST n . That is root ST leftChild 1 and rightChild R .

However for n 0 R n 1 is replaced by a node IR see . The positional information about the node IR is represented by L 1 0 0 .

The calculation of the root value from the complementary data is accomplished in accordance with the flow chart of .

 6 Setting the sorting result of step 5 to J LR V . . . J k 1 LR k 1 V k 1 and also setting a registration value of the relevant registration point to V the root values are recursively defined as follows W 0 W 1 . . . W k 1 W k . 0 0 i If then 1 . ii If LR j R then W j 1 h W j V j .

When calculating in accordance with the above definition there is obtained k 4 and W j can be calculated as follows 0 10 0 5 1 10 0 4 10 0 5 2 1 10 1 3 3 10 2 0 2 and 4 9 3 . Thus 3 1 10 and 4 10 .

The event ordering certification system of the fifth embodiment has the same effects as those of the fourth embodiment. As for the event ordering certification system for certifying the event ordering with the use of a tree structure it is supposed that the certification apparatus on receipt of an event ordering request from the user apparatus I publishes a certification reply in the chain complementary method including a receipt against the request note the certification reply containing the immediate complementary data of a registration point and the late complementary data of another registration point just before the registration point . Even then if the user apparatus I performs the incremental completion while using the certification reply it becomes possible for the user apparatus I to verify the temporal context in publishing respective receipts between the user apparatuses I. Therefore even if this validation occurred in advance of the electronic publication of public data collecting up the event ordering requests it is possible to verify the validity of the receipts.

Additionally the chain complementary method has the effect of reducing amount of data contained in the certification reply in comparison with the sequence complementary method. Also in the chain complementary method of course as the certification apparatus can employ not only the method of storing sequential aggregation trees in the memory part but a storing method using a stack structure it is possible to reduce storage capacity required for the certification apparatus remarkably.

Additionally since the incremental completion process by the user apparatus I includes both individual completion and bulk completion the apparatus I can verify the validity of a receipt by executing an appropriate incremental completion according to the situation. Further since the incremental completion can be accomplished even in a method where only partial local data is stored in the memory of the user apparatus I in place of storing all of the certification reply data items it is possible to reduce storage capacity required for the user apparatus I remarkably.

After completing the sequential aggregation period since the incremental completion allows the user apparatus I to acquire the complete complementary data the user apparatus I can calculate a root value of the sequential aggregation tree. Further when utilizing the root value of a sequential aggregation tree in the previous aggregation interval as an assigned value for the next sequential aggregation tree it is possible to verify the temporal context in the publication of receipts bridging these sequential aggregation trees with ease.

Various changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention. For instance the binary decision trees in the above mentioned embodiments may be replaced by directed trees where each parent has a plurality of children.

Additionally the user apparatus I or I may be equipped with user s side means for electronic information publication. In operation when the certification apparatus or stops its operation or vanishes data necessary for calculating a root value of the sequential aggregation tree before completing a constant aggregation interval the user s side means operates to select one or more of nodes whose assigned values are calculable and whose parents assigned values are not calculable from certification replies that the user apparatus has already received and stored by the time of stopping the operation of the apparatus or or vanishing the data. In succession the user s side means operates to publish the positional information and assigned value s of the selected node s electronically. In connection there may be further provided a designated validation organization that verifies whether the above electronic information published by the user apparatus I or I is consistent or not.

We now describe the feature of the sequential aggregation tree in the fourth and fifth embodiments in detail.

Regarding the leaf number i in the sequential aggregation tree a series of processes of accepting an event ordering request which forms the origin of sequentially assigning assigned values to leaves identified with i and successively assigning the assigned values to these leaves will be referred to as processing round and represented by. round i .

Now assume that C is a user apparatus Z an audit apparatus and both i and i denote two leaf numbers where i

 1 An assigned value for the authentication point is included in the immediate complementary data at the audit point i.e. node i 

 2 Let j i denote the above authentication point. Let ST be a sequential aggregation small tree where the leaf i belongs to when round j is ended. In connection an authentication path of i in ST is represented by authPathST i . As for various nodes belonging to the authPathST i assigned values for nodes at each level smaller than j are included in either the late complementary data that the user would receive on and after the round corresponding to node i or a receipt incl. immediate complementary data that the user has received at node i .

That is if i i then assigned values for the nodes belonging to authPath i j and having each level smaller than j are included in either immedData i or lateData i i and

 3 Assume that a root oath of leaf i in ST is represented by rtPathST i . Then it is possible to calculate an assigned value for the above authentication point and assigned values of nodes belonging to rtPath i i the nodes each having level smaller than the level of the authentication point from the late complementary data that the user would receive on and after the round corresponding to node i and the receipt incl. immediate complementary data that the user has received at node i .

We now describe a case of incorporating immediate complementary data into a receipt to be delivered to a user. Even when not incorporating the immediate complementary data into the receipt but instead incorporating the same information into late complementary data the same conclusion could be attained with similar argument.

 Case 1 First of all we refer to . Suppose a situation that both i and i belong to one sequential aggregation small tree ST in a sequential aggregation forest at the point of i. Assume here j i denotes a confluent point between i and i. Let j i be an authentication point being a left child of the confluent point. In a root path rtPathST i i of node i it is assumed that j i represents a node originating in node i and just before the confluent point. Then the authentication point coincides with a left complementary point of j i . Thus according to the definition of the authentication path authPathTST j i L is included in the authentication path of node i in ST. The assignment of a value for node j i has been completed before round i . Therefore j i L V j i is included in the immediate complementary data against node i .

 Case 2 Next we suppose a situation where both i and i do not belong to any sequential aggregation small tree in the sequential aggregation forest at the point i simultaneously with reference to . Then i belongs to a certain sequential aggregation small tree ST in the sequential aggregation forest at the point i. At this time due to the definition of the immediate complementary data for the registration point i V root ST is included in the immediate complementary data for the registration point i .

 Case 1 First of all we refer to . Suppose a situation that both i and i belong to the sequential aggregation small tree ST in the sequential aggregation forest at the point of i.

Further a row of nodes formed by elements of authPathST i and having each level smaller than j is represented by s . . . j 1 s j 1 . Then it has only to certify that V j r j is included in either immedData i or lateData i i for each j i.e. j 0 . . . j 1 .

By the definition of authPathST i it is noted that an element p j s j at level j of authPathST i i is either a right child of an element p at level j 1 of rtPathST i or the left child. We describe both cases respectively.

 Case 1 1 When p is the right child of p an assigned value V p of p is included in the late complementary data lateData i i that the apparatus C can receive at i satisfying i j as shown in . The reason is that when the event ordering certification on the round corresponding to leaf i is completed it has already become possible to calculate an assigned value for an ST partial tree indicated with B of . As a matter of fact the assigned values have been already calculated and assigned. Accordingly the late complementary data for the registration point i published on and after the above point of completion contains the assigned value V p for the root p of the partial tree B.

 Case 1 2 When p is the left child of p an assigned value V p for node p is included in the immediate complementary data for the registration point i as shown in . Because for the partial tree B having the root p of there is established 

Accordingly when starting the round identified with i an assigned value for leafs B has already become definite. Thus an assigned value for p root B has become definite on the round i. Therefore p is included in an aggregate of authentication path nodes of i whose assigned values have already becomes definite at the point i.

 Case 2 Next we refer to . Suppose a situation that both i and i do not belong to any sequential aggregation small tree in the sequential aggregation forest at the point of i simultaneously. Then i belongs to a certain sequential aggregation small tree ST in the sequential aggregation forest at i so that root ST constitutes an authentication point of i by i. Here assume that k height ST . An authentication point j i is included in a root path rtPathST i of i . Assume here that

Further a row of nodes formed by elements of authPathST i and having each level smaller than j is represented by s . . . j 1 s j 1 . Then it has only to certify that V j r j is included in either immedData i or lateData i i for each j i.e. j 0 . . . j 1 .

By the definition of authPathST i it is noted that an element p j s j at level j of authPathST i i is either a right child of an element p j 1 r j 1 at level j 1 of rtPathST i or the left child. We describe both cases respectively.

 Case 2 1 When p is the right child of p an assigned value V p of p is included in the late complementary data lateData i i that the apparatus C can receive at i satisfying i j as shown in . The reason is as follows. When the event ordering certification on the round corresponding to leaf i is completed it has already become possible to calculate an assigned value for an ST partial tree indicated with B of . As a matter of fact the assigned values have been already calculated and assigned. Accordingly the late complementary data for the registration point i published on and after the above point of completion contains the assigned value V p for the root p of the partial tree B.

 Case 2 2 When p is the left child of p an assigned value V p for node p is included in the immediate complementary data for the registration point i as shown in . Because about the partial tree B having the root p of there is established 

Accordingly when starting the round identified with i an assigned value for leafs B has already become definite. Thus an assigned value for p root B has become definite on the round i. Therefore p is included in an aggregate of authentication path nodes of i whose assigned values have already becomes definite at the point i.

 3 By the definition of authentication path and item 2 it is possible to calculate V j r j for each j 0 . . . j recursively as follows.

In the event ordering certification system for certifying the event ordering while using a tree structure according to the present invention it is possible to verify the event ordering receipt published from the event ordering certification organization without using public data where the event ordering requests are gathered up.

Consequently even if being in the middle of a publishing period it is possible to verify the validity of an event ordering receipt that the user apparatus has received enhancing the convenience of a user. Additionally even if failures occur in an event ordering certification organization it is possible to construct an event ordering certification system resistant to an obstacle.
