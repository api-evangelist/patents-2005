Ser. No. 60 594 298 filed on Mar. 26 2005 and entitled USES OF METADATA IN A STRUCTURED DATA FEED ENVIRONMENT.

Ser. No. 60 702 467 filed on Jul. 26 2005 and entitled VERTICAL MARKETS AND FEATURES FOR ENHANCED WEB SYSTEMS.

The invention relates to syndication and more specifically to systems for expanding the functionality a flexibility of RSS and other syndicated media.

Really Simple Syndication RSS media presents an emerging trend in networked communications involving the direct production and manipulation of text and multimedia by end users.

The public sees this layer primarily in terms of blogging that is the act of individuals creating Web sites and adding to them more or less daily. By dramatically increasing production and sharing of Web based content the blogging movement now produces a virtual river of content available continuously and with global circulation. Just as word processing empowered millions to create their own documents blogging software has made it relatively easy for millions to produce their own Web sites and keep them continually updated. By the promotion of a simple underlying standard for sharing text and other media blogging has popularized the syndication or passing on of content borrowed from others extending the reach of any given blogger and further increasing the total quantity of information in circulation.

A number of companies have emerged as niche players targeting various aspects of syndicated data streams. For example some companies such as FeedDemon NewsGator myYahoo Yahoo and Bloglines have focused on client side aggregation and presentation. Companies such as Technorati Google and Feedster have focused on the complementary services of searching for data feeds of interest. Other companies have focused on technologies for providing syndicated data streams such as SixApart Drupal TypePad Flickr Picasa Google and Blogger Google . Other companies have positioned themselves as content providers including new companies such as Engadget Weblogs Inc. Topix.net and MySpace as well as established media companies such as the New York Times and BBC. Of course various generic Internet technologies are also relevant to the rapidly growing weblog data flow such as BitTorrent or Akamai s EdgePlatform.

While offering significant advancement in terms of sharing and communication of news and other items the RSS value chain remains weak in many areas and could benefit from better integration and additional layers of functionality. For example RSS is relatively weak in terms of presentation search signal and network routing. Aggregators that centralize content use display formats that are widely criticized despite a general agreement among users that they improve over conventional search engine displays. In its current form RSS also fails to provide enterprise class features such as security privacy data integrity and quality of service.

Remarkably the rapidly growing content pool and the wide array of associated services and software technologies have arisen without the benefit of industry standards or formal commercial agreement on protocols. Thus the underlying RSS technology remains very rudimentary. There remains a need for enhanced data stream services and for an improved user interface and client tools for managing receiving and creating syndicated data streams.

A variety of tools and techniques are disclosed for managing viewing publishing searching clustering and otherwise manipulating data streams. Data streams such as RSS data feeds may be searched aggregated and filtered into a processed feed. The processed feed along with rules used to process the feed may be shared in a number of ways.

A server may provide a complementary search engine to locate new feeds and to store and or index items or posts in known feeds. Together these technologies may provide a richly functioned feed management system and greater ease of use for individuals in managing large numbers of feeds and large amounts of data in feeds. Additional functional layers may provide for authentication security and privacy metadata creation and management and social networking features. Using the management tools and additional functionality a syndicated data stream system may provide a platform for a wide array of useful consumer and business applications.

The terms feed data feed data stream and the like as well as the S definition described further below as used herein are intended to refer interchangeably to syndicated data feeds and or descriptions of such feeds. While RSS is one popular example of a syndicated data feed any other source of news or other items may be used with the systems described herein such as the outlining markup language OPML and these terms should be given the broadest possible meaning unless a narrow sense is explicitly provided or clear from the context. Similarly terms such as item news item and post as well as the S messages described further below are intended to refer to items within a data feed and may contain text and or binary data encoding any digital media including still or moving images audio application specific file formats and so on.

The term syndication is intended to refer to publication republication or other distribution of content using any suitable technology including RSS and any extensions or modifications thereto as well as any other publish subscribe or similar technology that may be suitably adapted to the methods and systems described herein. Syndicated is intended to describe content in syndication.

Various embodiments of the present invention are described below including certain embodiments relating particularly to RSS feeds and other syndicated data streams. It should be appreciated however that the present invention is not limited to any particular protocol for data feeds and that the various embodiments discussed explicitly herein are primarily for purposes of illustration. Thus the term syndication generally and references to RSS specifically should be understood to include for example RDF RSS v 0.90 0.91 0.9x 1.0 and 2.0 variously attributable to Netscape UserLand Software and other individuals and organizations as well as Atom from the AtomEnabled Alliance and any other similar formats as well as non conventional syndication formats that can be adapted for syndication such as OPML. Still more generally while RSS technology is described and RSS terminology is used extensively throughout it will be appreciated that the various concepts discussed herein may be usefully employed in a variety other contexts. For example various privacy and identity techniques described herein could be usefully combined with HTML Web content rather than RSS based XML data. Similarly some of the branding and advertising techniques described herein may be usefully combined with list servers bulletin boards or other Internet news sources. Thus it will be understood that the embodiments described herein are provided by way of example only and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventive concepts disclosed herein.

As shown in a network may include a plurality of clients and servers connected via an internetwork . Any number of clients and servers may participate in such a system . The system may further include one or more local area networks LAN interconnecting clients through a hub in for example a peer network such as a wired or wireless Ethernet network or a local area network server in for example a client server network . The LAN may be connected to the internetwork through a gateway which provides security to the LAN and ensures operating compatibility between the LAN and the internetwork . Any data network may be used as the internetwork and the LAN .

In one aspect of the systems described herein a device within the internetwork such as a router or on an enterprise level a gateway or other network edge or switching device may cache popular data feeds to reduce redundant traffic through the internetwork . In other network enhancements clients may be enlisted to coordinate sharing of data feeds using techniques such as those employed in a BitTorrent peer to peer network. In the systems described herein these and other techniques may be generally employed to improve performance of an RSS or other data feed network.

In one embodiment the internetwork is the Internet and the World Wide Web provides a system for interconnecting clients and servers in a communicating relationship through the Internet . The internetwork may also or instead includes a cable network and at least one of the clients may be a set top box cable ready game console or the like. The internetwork may include other networks such as satellite networks the Public Switched Telephone Network WiFi networks WiMax networks cellular networks and any other public private or dedicated networks that might be used to interconnect devices for transfer of data.

An exemplary client may include a processor a memory e.g. RAM a bus which couples the processor and the memory a mass storage device e.g. a magnetic hard disk or an optical storage disk coupled to the processor and the memory through an I O controller and a network interface coupled to the processor and the memory such as modem digital subscriber line DSL card cable modem network interface card wireless network card or other interface device capable of wired fiber optic or wireless data communications. One example of such a client is a personal computer equipped with an operating system such as Microsoft Windows XP UNIX or Linux along with software support for Internet communication protocols. The personal computer may also include a browser program such as Microsoft Internet Explorer Netscape Navigator or FireFox to provide a user interface for access to the internetwork . Although the personal computer is a typical client the client may also be a workstation mobile computer Web phone VOIP device television set top box interactive kiosk personal digital assistant wireless electronic mail device or other device capable of communicating over the Internet. As used herein the term client is intended to refer to any of the above described clients or other client devices and the term browser is intended to refer to any of the above browser programs or other software or firmware providing a user interface for navigating an internetwork such as the Internet.

An exemplary server includes a processor a memory e.g. RAM a bus which couples the processor and the memory a mass storage device e.g. a magnetic or optical disk coupled to the processor and the memory through an I O controller and a network interface coupled to the processor and the memory. Servers may be clustered together to handle more client traffic and may include separate servers for different functions such as a database server an application server and a Web presentation server. Such servers may further include one or more mass storage devices such as a disk farm or a redundant array of independent disk RAID system for additional storage and data integrity. Read only devices such as compact disk drives and digital versatile disk drives may also be connected to the servers. Suitable servers and mass storage devices are manufactured by for example Compaq IBM and Sun Microsystems. Generally a server may operate as a source of content and provide any associated back end processing while a client is a consumer of content provided by the server . However it should be appreciated that many of the devices described above may be configured to respond to remote requests thus operating as a server and the devices described as servers may operate as clients of remote data sources. In contemporary peer to peer networks and environments such as RSS environments the distinction between clients and servers blurs. Accordingly as used herein the term server as used herein is generally intended to refer to any of the above described servers or any other device that may be used to provide content such as RSS feeds in a networked environment.

Focusing now on the internetwork one embodiment is the Internet. The structure of the Internet is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and includes a network backbone with networks branching from the backbone. These branches in turn have networks branching from them and so on. The backbone and branches are connected by routers bridges switches and other switching elements that operate to direct data through the internetwork . For a more detailed description of the structure and operation of the Internet one may refer to The Internet Complete Reference by Harley Hahn and Rick Stout published by McGraw Hill 1994. However one may practice the present invention on a wide variety of communication networks. For example the internetwork can include interactive television networks telephone networks wireless voice or data transmission systems two way cable systems customized computer networks Asynchronous Transfer Mode networks and so on. Clients may access the internetwork through an Internet Service Provider ISP not shown or through a dedicated DSL service ISDN leased lines T1 lines OC3 lines digital satellite service cable modem service or any other connection or through an ISP providing same.

In its present deployment as the Internet the internetwork includes a worldwide computer network that communicates using the well defined Transmission Control Protocol TCP and Internet Protocol IP to provide transport and network services. Computer systems that are directly connected to the Internet each have a unique IP address. The IP address consists of four one byte numbers although a planned expansion to sixteen bytes is underway with IPv6 . To simplify Internet addressing the Domain Name System DNS was created. The DNS allows users to access Internet resources with a simpler alphanumeric naming system. A DNS name consists of a series of alphanumeric names separated by periods. When a domain name is used the computer accesses a DNS server to obtain the explicit four byte IP address. It will be appreciated that other internetworks may be used with the invention. For example the internetwork may be a wide area network a local area network a campus area network or corporate area network. The internetwork may be any other network used to communicate data such as a cable broadcast network. To further define the resources on the Internet the Uniform Resource Locator system was created. A Uniform Resource Locator URL is a descriptor that specifically defines a protocol for an Internet resource along with its location.

In an exemplary embodiment a browser executing on one of the clients retrieves a Web document at an address from one of the servers via the internetwork and displays the Web document on a viewing device e.g. a screen. A user can retrieve and view the Web document by entering or selecting a link to a URL in the browser. The browser then sends an http request to the server that has the Web document associated with the URL. The server responds to the http request by sending the requested Web document to the client . The Web document is an HTTP object that includes plain text ASCII conforming to the HyperText Markup Language HTML . Other markup languages are known and may be used on appropriately enabled browsers and servers including the Dynamic HyperText Markup Language DHTML the Extensible Markup Language XML the Extensible Hypertext Markup Language XHML and the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML .

Each Web document usually contains hyperlinks to other Web documents. The browser displays the Web document on the screen for the user and the hyperlinks to other Web documents are emphasized in some fashion such that the user can identify and select each hyperlink. To enhance functionality a server may execute programs associated with Web documents using programming or scripting languages such as Perl C C C or Java or a Common Gateway Interface CGI script to access applications on the server. A server may also use server side scripting languages such as ColdFusion from MacroMedia or PHP. These programs and languages may perform back end functions such as order processing database management and content searching. A Web document may also contain or include references to small client side applications or applets that are transferred from the server to the client along with a Web document and executed locally by the client . Java is one popular example of a programming language used for applets. The text within a Web document may further include non displayed scripts that are executable by an appropriately enabled browser using a scripting language such as JavaScript or Visual Basic Script. Browsers may further be enhanced with a variety of helper applications to interpret various media including still image formats such as JPEG and GIF document formats such as PS and PDF motion picture formats such as AVI and MPEG animated media such as Flash media and sound formats such as MP3 and MIDI. These media formats along with a growing variety of proprietary media formats may be used to enrich a user s interactive and audio visual experience as each Web document is presented through the browser. The term page as used herein is intended to refer to the Web document described above as well as any of the above described functional or multimedia content associated with the Web document 

In general operation a server may provide a data stream to a client . In an exemplary embodiment the data stream may be a syndicated data stream such as RSS an XML grammar for sharing data through the Web. An RSS enabled server may include an RSS file with a title and description of items to be syndicated. As with simple HTML documents the RSS file may be hand coded or computer generated. The first line of an RSS file may contain an XML declaration of the form 

While not strictly required this declaration may improve version compatibility. The next item in an RSS file may be a Document Type Declaration DTD that identifies the file as an RSS document 

The RSS element is the root or top level element of an RSS file. The RSS element must specify the version attribute in this example version 0.91 . It may also contain an encoding attribute the default is UTF 8 

The root element is the top level element that contains the rest of an XML document. An RSS element may contain a channel with a title the name of the channel description short description of the channel link HTML link to the channel Web site language language encoding of the channel such as en us for U.S. English and one or more item elements. A channel may also contain the following optional elements 

A channel may contain an image or logo. In RSS the image element contains the image title and the URL of the image itself. The image element may also include the following optional elements a link a URL that the image links to a width a height and a description additional text displayed with the image . There may also be a text input element for an HTML text field. The text input element may include a title label for a submit button description name and link to send input . The link may enable richer functionality such as allowing a user to submit search terms send electronic mail or perform any other text based function.

Once defined in this manner a channel may contain a number of items although some services e.g. Netscape Netcenter may limit the number. In general the item elements provide headlines and summaries of the content to be shared. New items may be added either manually or automatically such as through a script by appending them to the RSS file.

The content source may provide any electronic content including newspaper articles Web magazine articles academic papers government documents such as court opinions administrative rulings regulation updates or the like opinions editorials product reviews movie reviews financial or market analysis current events bulletins and the like. The content may include text formatting layout graphics audio files image files movie files word processing files spreadsheet files presentation files electronic documents HTML files executable files scripts multi media relational databases data from relational databases and or any other content type or combination of types suitable for syndication through a network. The content source may be any commercial media provider s such as a newspapers news services e.g. Reuters or Bloomberg or individual journalists such as syndicated columnists. The content source may also be from commercial entities such as corporations non profit corporations charities religious organizations social organizations or the like as well as from individuals with no affiliation to any of the foregoing. The content source may be edited as with news items or automated as with data feeds such as stock tickers sports scores weather conditions and so on. While written text is commonly used in data feeds it will be appreciated that any digital media may be binary encoded and included in an item of a data feed such as RSS. For example data feeds may include audio moving pictures still pictures executable files application specific files e.g. word processing documents or spreadsheets and the like. It should also be understood that while a content source may generally be understood as a well defined source of items for a data feed the content source may be more widely distributed or subjectively gathered by a user preparing a data feed . For example an individual user interested in automotive mechanics may regularly read a number of related magazines and regularly attend trade shows. This information may be processed on an ad hoc basis by the individual and placed into a data feed for review and use by others. Thus it will be understood that the data stream systems described herein may have broad commercial use as well as non commercial educational and mixed uses.

As described generally above the data feed may include for each item of content summary information such as a title synopsis or abstract or a teaser for more marketing oriented materials and a link to the underlying content. Thus as depicted in when a client accesses a data feed as depicted by an arrow the client may then display the summary information for each item in a user interface. A client may in response to user input such as clicking on a title of an item in the user interface retrieve the underlying item from the content source as indicated by an arrow . In the bi directional communication depicted by the arrow the client may also identify the specific data feed through which the item was identified which may be useful for tracking distribution channels customer behavior affiliate referral fees and so forth. It should be appreciated that an RSS data feed may be presented to a client as an RSS file in XML format that the client locally converts to HTML for viewing through a Web browser or the data feed may be converted to HTML at a Web site that responds to HTTP requests from a client and responds with an HTML formatted data feed.

A related concept is the so called permalink that provides a permanent URL reference to a source document that may be provided from for example a dynamically generated Web site or a document repository served from a relational database behind a Web server. While there is no official standard for permalink syntax or usage they are widely used in conjunction with data feeds. Permalinks typically consist of a string of characters which represent the date and time of posting and some system dependent identifier which includes a base URL and often identifies the author subscriber or department which initially authored the item . If an item is changed renamed or moved its permalink remains unaltered. If an item is deleted altogether its permalink cannot be reused. Permalinks are exploited in a number of applications including link tracing and link track back in Weblogs and references to specific Weblog entries in RSS or Atom syndication streams. Permalinks are supported in most modern weblogging and content syndication software systems including Movable Type LiveJournal and Blogger.

RSS provides a standard format for the delivery of content through data feeds. This makes it relatively straightforward for a content provider to distribute content broadly and for an affiliate to receive and process content from multiple sources. It will be appreciated that other RSS compliant and or non RSS compliant feeds may be syndicated as that term is used herein and as described in greater detail below. As noted above the actual content may not be distributed directly only the headlines which means that users will ultimately access the content source if they re interested in a story. It is also possible to distribute the item of content directly through RSS though this approach may compromise some of the advantages of network efficiency items are not copied and distributed in their entirety and referral tracking. Traffic to a Web site that hosts a content source can increase in response to distribution of data feeds .

Although not depicted a single content source may also have multiple data feeds . These may be organized topically or according to target clients . Thus the same content may have data feeds for electronic mailing lists PDAs cell phones and set top boxes. For example a content provider may decide to offer headlines in a PDA friendly format or create a weekly email newsletter describing what s new on a Web site.

Data feeds in a standard format provide for significant flexibility in how content is organized and distributed. An aggregator for example may be provided that periodically updates data from a plurality of data feeds . In general an aggregator may make many data feeds available as a single source. As a significant advantage this intermediate point in the content distribution chain may also be used to customize feeds and presentation thereof as well as to filter items within feeds and provide any other administrative services to assist with syndication distribution and review of content.

As will be described in greater detail below the aggregator may filter prioritize or otherwise process the aggregated data feeds. A single processed data feed may then be provided to a client as depicted by an arrow . The client may request periodic updates from the data feed created by the aggregator as also indicated by an arrow . As indicated by an arrow the client may also configure the aggregator such as by adding data streams removing data streams searching for new data streams explicitly filtering or prioritizing items from the data streams or designating personal preferences or profile data that the aggregator may apply to generate the aggregated data feed . When an item of interest is presented in the user interface of the client a user may select a link to the item causing the client to retrieve the item from the associated content source as indicated by an arrow . The aggregator may present the data feed as a static web page that is updated only upon an explicit request from the client or the aggregator may push updates to a client using either HTTP or related Web browser technologies or by updates through some other channel such as e mail updates. It will also be appreciated that while the aggregator is illustrated as separate from the client the aggregator may be realized as a primarily client side technology where software executing on the client assumes responsibility for directly accessing a number of data feeds and aggregating filtering results from those feeds .

It will be appreciated that a user search for feeds will be improved by the availability of well organized databases. While a number of Weblogs provide local search functionality and a number of aggregator services provide lists of available data feeds there remains a need for a consumer level searchable database of feed content. As such one aspect of the system described herein is a database of data feeds that is searchable by contents as well as metadata such as title and description. In a server used with the systems described herein the entire universe of known data feeds may be hashed or otherwise organized into searchable form in real time or near real time. The hash index may include each word or other symbol and any data necessary to locate it in a stream and in a post.

The advent of commonly available data feeds such as RSS feeds along with tools such as aggregators enables new modes of communication. In one common use a user may through a client post aggregated feeds to a Weblog. The information posted on a Weblog may include an aggregated feed one or more data feeds that are sources for the aggregated feed and any personal political technical or editorial comments that are significant to the author. As such all participants in an RSS network may become authors or sources of content as well as consumers.

At present the consumer to consumer market model consists primarily of millions of individual bloggers mostly communicating with each other. This includes non commercial Weblogs where individuals aggregate data feeds from a variety of sources and include editorial commentary or other information. In general a source in this space is an individual presenting aggregated feeds in a Web site with some common theme or themes of interest to the author such as history sports science technology politics literature art music and so forth. However there are no strict requirements that any one or more themes be followed and the Weblog may simply reflect an ad hoc selection of topics that the author finds interesting. Weblogs in this space gain popularity according to the content provided with readership and associated RSS subscriptions or registrations rising or falling according to general interest.

The consumer to business model or segment brings together consumers who are interested in a particular topic typically a topic with a corresponding commercial market such as automobiles mortgages financial services home repair hobbies and the like. A topic may be still more refined such as antique automobiles or antique American automobiles however the corresponding participation of commercial participants may depend on the scope of the market. Thus a large number of financial service providers could be expected to subscribe to an RSS data feed for general consumers of financial services however a smaller number of commercial subscribers might be expected for derivative currency hedge instruments among Pacific Rim country currencies. In general consumer to business uses may provide consumers with concerns interests and preferences in a particular market with a forum that will be followed by corresponding commercial interests. In addition by participating in this RSS network businesses may also address consumer interests in a more direct and personal way as distinguished from the business to consumer segment discussed below. At the same time it will be appreciated that the distinction between these segments need not be an absolute one and a synthesis of these two communication channels may result in a greater dialogue between commercial and individual actors to their collective and mutual benefit. Thus for example with a suitable configured aggregated feed and associated Web presentation an automobile manufacture could design a new minivan or SUV in cooperation with the automobile buying public in a manner that addresses previously unknown purchasing preferences of consumers. Additionally since the community of participants is likely to be highly focused this segment may offer significant opportunities for revenue from targeted advertising.

The business to business segment does not appear to be commonly used although in the methods and systems described herein blogs and other RSS media along with suitable security and identity features discussed below may substitute for much of email and other forms of corporate and business to business communication such as time management inventory supply chain manufacturing and customer relations information flow.

The business to consumer segment includes an extension of traditional media companies that can add data feed capabilities to their online presence. This includes news companies in print media radio television media and Internet media including by way of example and not limitation the New York Times the Washington Post the Wall Street Journal Forbes Time Business Week CSPAN ESPN The Weather Channel CNBC CNET Bloomberg Reuters and so on. This may also include non news related media that nonetheless periodically updates content such as movie studios network television cable television and so on. In addition other companies that serve consumers are may also usefully employ data feed systems including companies ranging from catalogue companies such as Land s End to consumer electronics retailer Best Buy. In this context the RSS platform offers a reliable distribution channel for advertising new products and special offers to presumably interested consumers. These and other applications may be realized using the data feed technology described herein.

All such entity to entity communications described above may be improved through enhanced syndication systems as generally described herein. It will be appreciated that one obstacle to expanded use across all of these markets is the absence in the primary technology RSS of enterprise class features such as security authentication conditional access data repositories and rich metadata to name a few. In one aspect the systems described herein bring many of these features to RSS like systems to provide secure scalable syndication systems.

It should be clear that while the term aggregator is used to label aspects of the systems disclosed herein those systems include significant useful and advantageous functionality that is not present in any aggregator in the prior art and as such the term should be interpreted broadly to optionally include all of the functions and techniques described below rather than narrowly in the sense that it is currently used in the art. Although broader in meaning the aggregator and interface described below may operate for example from one of the servers described above with reference to and may cooperate with other participants and content sources in the manner depicted for the aggregator described in .

It will be appreciated that the components described herein correspond generally to various areas of functionality for a data feed system. However in various embodiments other components may be added or certain components may be removed or combined with other components. For example the aggregator described herein may cooperate with an n tier architecture for a more general purpose Web server or with a relational database or other back end systems not specifically depicted herein to store and access data. Similarly the systems described herein may include FTP servers e mail servers PSTN interfaces and other physical connections and protocols for various other functions that may be usefully combined with the aggregator to enhance functionality. Any number of such combinations and variations may be employed consistent with the systems described herein and are intended to fall with the scope of the present disclosure.

It will also be appreciated that a wide range of software and hardware platforms may be used to deploy the systems described herein. Generally the system components may be realized in hardware software or some combination of these. The components may be realized in one or more microprocessors microcontrollers embedded microcontrollers programmable digital signal processors or other programmable device along with internal and or external memory such as read only memory programmable read only memory electronically erasable programmable read only memory random access memory dynamic random access memory double data rate random access memory Rambus direct random access memory flash memory or any other volatile or non volatile memory for storing program instructions program data and program output or other intermediate or final results. The components may also or instead include one or more application specific integrated circuits ASICs dedicated semiconductor devices programmable gate arrays programmable array logic devices or any other device that may be configured to process electronic signals.

Any combination of the above circuits and components whether packaged discretely as a chip as a chip set or as a die may be suitably adapted to use with the systems described herein. It will further be appreciated that the above components may be realized as computer executable code created using a structured programming language such as C an object oriented programming language such as C or any other high level or low level programming language that may be compiled or interpreted to run on one of the above devices as well as heterogeneous combinations of processors processor architectures or combinations of different hardware and software.

Services related to applications may be embodied for example in a client side application including commercially available applications such as a word processor spreadsheet presentation software database system task management system supply chain management system inventory management system human resources management system user interface system operating system graphics system computer game electronic mail system calendar system media player and the like a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack a web service a service oriented architecture service a Java applet or a combination of these. Applications may include for example a user interface social networking vertical market applications media viewers transaction processing alerts event action pairs analysis and so forth. Applications may also accommodate vertical market uses of other aspects of the system by integrating various aspects of for example security interfaces databases syndication and the like. Example of vertical markets include financial services health care electronic commerce communications advertising sales marketing supply chain management retail accounting professional services and so forth. In one aspect the applications may include social networking tools to support functions such as sharing and pooling of syndicated content content filters content sources content commentary and the like as well as formation of groups affiliations and the like. Social networking tools may support dynamic creation of communities and moderation of dialogues within communities while providing individual participants with any desired level of anonymity. Social networking tools may also or instead evaluate popularity of feeds or items in a syndication network or permit user annotation evaluation or categorization. A user interface from the application may also complement other services layers. For example an application may provide a user interface that interprets semantic content to determine one or more display characteristics for associated items of syndicated content.

Other services may include any other services not specifically identified herein that may be usefully employed within an enhanced syndication system. For example content from the sources may be formatted for display through a formatting service that interprets various types of data and determines an arrangement and format suitable for display. This may also include services that are specifically identified which may be modified enhanced or adapted to different uses through the other services . Other services may support one or more value added services. For example a security service may provide for secure communications among users or from users to sources. An identity service may provide verification of user or source identities such as by reference to a trusted third party. An authentication service may receive user credentials and control access to various sources or other services within the system. A financial transaction service may execute financial transactions among users or between users and sources . Any service amenable to computer implementation may be deployed as one or more other services either alone or in combination with services from other elements of the system .

Data services may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Data services may include for example include search query view extract or any other database function. Data services may also or instead include data quality functions such as data cleansing deduplication and the like. Data services may also or instead include transformation functions for transforming data between data repositories or among presentation formats. Thus for example data may be transformed from entries in a relational database or items within an OPML outline into a presentation format such as MS Word MS Excel or MS PowerPoint. Similarly data may be transformed from a source such as an OPML outline into a structured database. Data services may also or instead include syndication specific functions such as searching of data feeds or items within data feeds or filtering items for relevance from within selected feeds or clustering groups of searches and or filters for republication as an aggregated and or filtered content source . In one aspect a data service as described herein provides a repository of historical data feeds which may be combined with other services for user configurable publication of aggregated filtered and or annotated feeds. More generally data services may include any functions associated with data including storing manipulating retrieving transforming verifying authenticating formatting reformatting tagging linking hyperlinking reporting viewing and so forth. A search engine deployed within the data services may permit searching of data feeds or with a content database as described herein searching or filtering of content within data feeds from sources . Data services may be adapted for use with databases such as commercially available databases from Oracle Microsoft IBM and or open source databases such as MySQL AB or PostgreSQL.

Semantics or semantic processing may include any functions or services associated with the meaning of content from the sources and may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Semantics may include for example interrelating content into a knowledge structure using for example OPML adding metadata or enriching current metadata interpreting or translating content and so forth. Semantics may also include parsing content either linguistically for substantive or grammatical analysis or programmatically for generation of executable events. Semantics may include labeling data feeds and items within feeds either automatically or manually. This may also include interpretation of labels or other metadata and automated metadata enrichment. Semantics may also provide a semantic hierarchy for categorizing content according to user specified constraints or against a fixed dictionary or knowledge structure. Generally any function relating to the categorization interpretation or labeling of content may be performed within a semantic layer which may be used for example by users to interpret content or by sources to self identify content. Categorization may be based on one or more factors such as popularity explicit user categorization interpretation or analysis of textual graphical or other content relationship to other items such as through an outline or other hierarchical description content type e.g. file type content metadata e.g. author source distribution channel time of publication etc. and so forth. Currently available tools for semantic processing include OPML dictionaries thesauruses and metadata tagging. Current tools also include an array of linguistic analysis tools which may be deployed as a semantic service or used by a semantic service. These and other tools may be employed to evaluate semantic content of an item including the body and metadata thereof and to add or modify semantic information accordingly.

It will be understood that while OPML is one specific outlining grammar any similar grammar whether XML based ASCII based or the like may be employed provided it offers a manner for explicitly identifying hierarchies and or relationships among items within a document and or among documents. Where the grammar is XML based it is referred to herein as an outlining markup language.

Semantics may be deployed for example as a semantic service associated with a syndication platform or service. The semantic service may be for example a web service a service in a services oriented architecture a layer of a protocol stack a client side or server side application or any of the other technologies described herein as well as various combinations of these. The semantic service may offer a variety of forms of automated semi automated or manual semantic analysis of items of syndicated content including feeds or channels that provide such items. The semantic service may operate in one or more ways with syndicated content. In one aspect the semantic service may operate on metadata within the syndicated content as generally noted above. The semantic service may also or instead store metadata independent from the syndicated content such as in a database which may be publicly accessible or privately used by a value added semantic service provider or the like. The semantic service may also or instead specify relationships among items of syndicated content using an outlining service such as OPML. In general an outlining service outlining markup language outlining syntax or the like provides a structured grammar for specifying relationships such as hierarchical relationships among items of content. The relationship may for example be a tree or other hierarchical structure that may be self defined by a number of discrete relationships among individual items within the tree. Any number of such outlines may be provided in an outline based semantic service.

By way of an example of use of a semantic service a plurality of items of syndicated content such as news items relating to a corporate entity may be aggregated for presentation as a data feed. Other content such as stored data items may be associated with the data feed using an outline markup language so that an outline provided by the semantic service includes current events relating to a corporate entity along with timely data from a suitable data source such as stoke quotes bond prices or any other financial instrument data e.g. privately held securities stock options futures contracts along with publicly available data such as SEC filings including quarterly reports annual reports or other event reports. All of these data sources may be collected for a company using an outline that structures the aggregated data and provides pointers to a current source of data where the data might change such as stock quotes or SEC filings . Thus an outline may provide a fixed structured and current view of the corporate entity where data from different sources changes with widely varying frequencies. Of course other content such as message boards discussion groups and the like may be incorporated into the outline along with relatively stable content such as a web site URL for the entity.

Syndication may include any functions or services associated with a publish subscribe environment and may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Syndication may include syndication specific functions such publication subscription aggregation republication and more generally management of syndication information e.g. source date author and the like . One commonly employed syndication system is RSS although it will be appreciated from the remaining disclosure that a wide array of enhanced syndication services may provided in cooperation with or separate from an RSS infrastructure.

Infrastructure may include any low level functions associated with enhanced syndication services and may be embodied for example in a client side application a remote application or service an application layer of an enhanced syndication services protocol stack as application services deployed for example in the services oriented architecture described below or a combination of these. Infrastructure may support for example security authentication traffic management logging pinging communications reporting time and date services and the like.

In one embodiment the infrastructure may include a communications interface adapted for wireless delivery of RSS content. RSS content is typically developed for viewing by a conventional full sized computer screen however users increasingly view web content including RSS feeds using wireless devices such as cellular phones Personal Digital Assistants PDAs wireless electronic mail devices such as Blackberrys and the like. In many cases content that is suitable for a normal computer screen is not appropriate for a small screen for example the amount of text that can be read on the screen is reduced. Accordingly embodiments of the invention include formatting RSS feeds for wireless devices. In particular embodiments of the invention include methods and systems for providing content to a user including taking a feed of RSS content determining a user interface format for a wireless device and reformatting the RSS content for the user interface for the wireless device. In embodiments the content may be dynamically reformatted based on the type of wireless device.

In embodiments tags from an RSS feed can be used to feed a template such as an XML enabled template that further modifies the RSS feed based on the nature of a wireless device. For example the abstract of an RSS feed can be delivered in a shortened format such as identifying and delivering the first sentence of the abstract. An RSS feed can also be broken up into sub segments and a user can be provided with a link within the feed for requesting additional sub segments or additional portions of the feed thus permitting a user to control content delivery where for example the user has a bandwidth constrained or display constrained device. In embodiments the link may be interactive and may be activated or manipulated by a user with a control such as a button thumbpad touchscreen dial button or stylus.

In embodiments an RSS feed may further comprise inserting a phone number into the feed wherein interacting with the phone number on a cellular phone or other telecommunications capable device initiates a telephone call. The telephone call could be to a content source such as to allow a user to hear a voice rendition of the content of the RSS feed to hear related content such as programming related to the RSS feed to initiate a transaction such as related to the content of the RSS feed to request a particular type of additional information to allow the user to subscribe to the feed or the like.

In embodiments the RSS feed may include a time related component such as a schedule for the delivery of additional content. In embodiments the time related component may be fed to a calendar task list or related facility thus setting an appointment related to the time related component in a user s electronic calendar such as on a handheld device or on a conventional personal computer or laptop computer.

In embodiments an RSS feed may be provided with a separate layer of security that is associated with a security facility of a wireless device. For example an RSS feed may be encrypted so that it may only be read by a specific type of wireless device a specific wireless device or on a specific wireless device only after entry of a password that is issued to a known user of that wireless device. In embodiments security may be associated with a location facility of the wireless device such as GPS cellular triangulation or the like such as to allow a user to access an RSS feed only if the user is physically located in a particular place. For example a user attending a live concert or other event might be permitted to view an RSS feed about the concert but other users might be excluded from that content creating a secure new media channel for event attendees.

In embodiments a user interface for a wireless or handheld device may be customized to include menus that specifically relate to RSS content. For example an interface may be provided with a separate RSS menu icon drop down selection or the like for allowing a user to place such a device in an RSS mode. Within an RSS mode initiated by an RSS menu option a user may be provided with options to take actions related to RSS such as subscribing to feeds selecting feeds from a set of feeds prioritizing feeds selecting feeds as favorites or the like. In embodiments an RSS mode may include a menu item for each of or a subset of the components of the RSS schema. For example a menu icon drop down item or the like may allow a user to select and view the title of an RSS feed the abstract text the authors or other content. In embodiments the user interface of a wireless or handheld device may have an RSS search icon menu or screen that returns RSS results in response to entry of a keyword. In embodiments results may be returned that include commercial and non commercial result sets which may be distinguished on the screen such as by screen location by an icon that identifies them as such or by another indicator of the distinction such as color font underlining italics boldface type highlighting or the like.

In another aspect the infrastructure may include improved pinging systems. The only current form of network service in an RSS environment is a primitive system of pings such as those provided by weblogs.com that permit users to track changes and updates to content. When a producer updates its RSS output file a message is sent to a central file server. When consumers want to know if there are updated RSS outputs from particular sources they go to the central file and see if there is a recent message from the producer of choice rather than retrieving the RSS source directly. When new content is available the consumer may send an electronic request directly to the producer s output file and read the contents into the consumers local files archive or repository. The infrastructure for an enhanced syndication system may provide improved pinging systems. For example a central server may be secure. In such a system each request for a ping may carry an encryption based key for the requestor. Responses to that requestor which may be verified for example with reference to a trusted third party or using some other technique may be time bound with constraints on start times stop times frequency quotas or the like. In another embodiment the requestor may simply use a unique identification number. Pings may be subscription based such that a for fee pinger may be used more frequently than a free pinger. Thus there is disclosed herein a secure pinger for use in an RSS system. Also disclosed herein is a managed pinger which may limit ping responses according to subscription levels frequency or any other suitable criteria.

The infrastructure may more generally provide traffic management services including but not limited to real time monitoring of message latency traffic and congestion and packet quality across a network of end to end RSS exchanges and relationships. This may include real time monitoring of special traffic problems such as denial of service attacks or overload of network capabilities. Another service may be Quality of Service management that provides a publisher with the ability to manage time of sending of signaling messages for pingers time of availability of the signaled about messages unique identifiers which apply to the signaling message and the signaled about message or messages. This may also include quality of service attributes for the signaled about message or messages and criteria for selecting end user computers that are to be treated to particular levels of end to end quality of service. This may be for example a commercial service in which users pay for higher levels of QoS.

It will be generally appreciated that the arrangement of layers and interfaces may vary however in one embodiment syndication may communicate directly with sources while the applications may communicate directly with users . Thus in one aspect the systems described herein enable enhanced syndication systems by providing a consistent framework for consumption and republication of content by users . In general existing technologies such as RSS provide adequate syndication services but additional elements of a syndication system such as social networking and semantic content management have been provided only incrementally and only on an ad hoc basis from specific service providers. The functions and services described above may be realized through for example the services oriented architecture described below with reference to and or any of the markup languages described below with reference to .

In one example model of an end to end content syndication system for e.g. RSS OPML or other content may include the following elements convert structure store spider pool search filter cluster route run. Conversion may transform data bi directionally between application specific or database specific formats and the syndication or outlining format. Structure may be derived from the content such as a knowledge structure inherent in interrelated OPML outlines or metadata contained in RSS tags. Storage may occur locally on a user device or at a remote repository. Spiders may be employed to search repositories and local data on user devices to the extent that it is made publicly available or actively published. Pools of data may be formed at central repositories or archives. Search may be conducted across one or more pools of data. Filters may be employed to select specific data feeds items within a data feed or elements of an OPML tree structure. Specific items or OPML tree branches may be clustered based upon explicit search criteria inferences from metadata or content or community rankings or commentary. Routing may permit combinations among content from various content sources using e.g. web services or superservices. Such combinations may be run to generate corresponding display of results. Other similar or different combinations of elements from the broad categories above may be devised according to various value chains or other conceptual models of syndication services.

More generally well defined interfaces between a collection of discrete modules for an established value chain may permit independent development improvement adaptation and or customization of modules by end users or commercial entities. This may include configurations of features within a module which might be usefully shared with others for example as well as functional changes to underlying software.

For example an author may wish to use any one or more of a number of environments to create content for syndication. By providing a module with a standardized interface to RSS posting converters may be created for that module to convert between application formats and an RSS ready format. This may free contributors to create content in any desired format and with suitable converters readily transform the content into RSS ready material. Thus disparate applications such as Microsoft Word Excel and Outlook may be used to generate content with the author leveraging off features of those applications such as spell checking grammar checking calculation capabilities scheduling capabilities and so on . The content may then be converted into RSS material and published to an RSS feed. As a significant advantage users may work in an environment in which they are comfortable and simply obtain needed converters to supply content to the RSS network. As a result contributors may be able to more efficiently produce source material of higher quality. Tagging tools may also be incorporated into this module or some author module to provide any degree of automation and standardization desired by an author for categorization of content.

As another example appropriate characterization of RSS material remains a constantly growing problem. However if tagging occurs at a known and predictable point in the RSS chain e.g. within a specific module then any number of useful applications may be constructed within or in communication with that module to assist with tagging. For example all untagged RSS posts may be extracted from feeds and pooled at a commonly accessible location where one or more people may resolve tagging issues. Or the module may automatically resolve tagging recommendations contributed by readers of the item. Different rules may be constructed for different streams of data according to editorial demands or community preferences. In short maintaining a separate tagging module or fixing the tagging function at a particular module within the chain permits a wide array of tagging functions which may be coordinated with other aspects of the RSS chain.

In another aspect a well defined organization of modules permits improved synchronization or coordination of different elements of the modules in the RSS chain. Thus for example centralized aggregators may be provided to improve usability or to improve the tagging of content with metadata where a combination of lack of standards and constantly evolving topics has frustrated attempts to normalize tagging vocabulary. By explicitly separating tagging from content visibility of tagging behavior may be improved and yield better tag selection by content authors. Similarly search techniques mapping and exploration may be fully separated from indexing pre processing to permit independent improvement in each.

A well established backplane or other communications system for cooperating RSS modules or other data feeds may enable a number of business processes or enterprise applications particularly if coupled with identity security role management which may be incorporated into the backplane or various modules connected thereto to control access to data feeds.

For example a document management system may be enhanced using an enhanced RSS system. Large companies particularly document intensive companies such as professional services firms including accounting firms law firms consulting firms and financial services firms employ sophisticated document management systems that provide unique identifiers and metadata for each new document created by employees. Each new document may also for example be added to an RSS feed. This may occur at any identifiable point during the document s life such as when first stored when mailed when printed or at any other time. By viewing the RSS feed with for example topical filters an individual may filter the stream of new documents for items of interest. Thus for example a partner at a law firm may remain continuously updated on all external correspondence relating to SEC Regulation FD compliance with Sarbanes Oxley or any other matter of interest. Alternatively a partner may wish to see all documents relating to a certain client. Similarly a manager at a brokerage house may wish to monitor all trades of more than a certain number of shares for a certain stock. Or an accountant may wish to see all internal memoranda relating to revisions to depreciation allowances in the federal tax code. An enhanced RSS system may provide any number of different perspectives on newly created content within an organization.

Other enterprise wide applications may be created. For example a hospital may place all prescriptions written by physicians at the hospital into an RSS feed. This data may be viewed and analyzed to obtain a chronological view of treatment.

In general the service requester which may be any of the clients described above discovers services and receives service descriptions through an exchange with the service broker using a suitable syntax such as the Web Services Description Language WSDL . The service provider publishes service descriptions to the service broker also using a syntax such as WSDL. The service requester uses a service through communications with the service provider using a transport protocol such as Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP . An SOA may include any number of requesters brokers and providers . Additionally a number of protocols and standards may be employed to orchestrate the deployment of services in an SOA . In a web services embodiment the Web service protocol stack is employed to define locate implement and interact with Web services. In general this includes four main areas service transport XML messaging service description and service discovery. Service transport transports messages among network applications using protocols such as HyperText Transport Protocol HTTP File Transfer Protocol FTP Simple Mail Transfer Protocol SMTP and more recently the Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol BEEP . XML messaging encodes messages in a common XML format using for example XML RPC SOAP and REST. The service description is used to describe the public interface for services typically using WSDL as noted above. Service discovery may use WSDL along with Universal Description Discovery and Integration UDDI which provides a platform independent XML based registry for public Internet listings.

An SOA architecture may be used for example in an enhanced syndication system to relate metadata in an item of content to services that are available from the registry. Thus for example a publicly available registry may provide among other things a number of viewers for graphical images. An RSS item may refer to an image source such as an MRI image in a medical record from a hospital and may specify a viewer for the source image that is available through the registry. In operation a client with appropriate permissions to view the image also as managed e.g. through the metadata for the enhanced syndication system may retrieve the appropriate viewer service from the registry and apply the viewer to view the source image. In this example viewers may be freely provided or may be licensed and made available through the registry on a fee per use basis or some other licensing terms. Similarly the image source may be made available in various resolutions each available under a different fee structure. In other embodiments textual sources may be available in various forms ranging from a title and biographical data to an abstract to the full text of the source. Thus the SOA platform may be used to resell content from an RSS archive using viewer or access privilege services made available through the registry. Other aspects such as identity and affiliation as well as verification of these may be made available as services in the SOA .

Services which may be for example any of the services described above with reference to may employ a variety of standards protocols and programming languages to interact meaningfully with the data . This includes for example the use of programming tools that permit program logic to be deployed in e.g. Java Windows Perl PHP C C and so on. This also includes parsing processing and database access using e.g. data binding mapping XML components into native formats of various programming languages Document Object Model DOM a programming interface for manipulation of XML HTML as program objects Simple API for XML SAX another API for XML documents XSL a stylesheet expression language XSL Transformations XSLT a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents XML Path Language XPATH a language for referring to parts of XML documents XSL Formatting Objects XSL FO an XML vocabulary for formatting semantics and a variety of tools for queries and other access to commercial databases. Further presentation may be provided using e.g. XHTML CSS XSL FO SMIL WSUI and a host of other presentation tools. Services may also employ various other XML oriented tools for messaging metadata and web services including SOAP XML RPC RDF UDDI WSDL and the like. Other specifications such as the Voice eXtensible Markup Language VoiceXML Security Services Markup Language S2ML and OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language SAML provide special purpose grammars for specific functions. In general these tools in various combinations permit a relatively arbitrary deployment of functions as services on top of content structured using XML grammars.

The services may interact with data through one or more established grammars such as a secure markup language a finance markup language WSDL the Outline Programming Markup Language OPML or other markup languages based upon XML which is a species of the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML . The interaction may be also or instead through non XML grammars such as HTML which is a species of SGML or other formats . More generally a wide array of XML schemas have been devised for industry specific and application specific environments. For example XML.org lists the following vertical industries with registered XML schemas including the number of registered schemas in parentheses all of which may be usefully combined with the systems described herein and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety Accounting 14 Advertising 6 Aerospace 20 Agriculture 3 Arts Entertainment 24 Astronomy 14 Automotive 14 Banking 10 Biology 9 Business Reporting 2 Business Services 3 Catalogs 9 Chemistry 4 Computer 9 Construction 8 Consulting 20 Customer Relation 8 Customs 2 Databases 11 E Commerce 60 EDI 18 ERP 4 Economics 2 Education 51 Energy Utilities 35 Environmental 1 Financial Service 53 Food Services 3 Geography 5 Healthcare 25 Human Resources 23 Industrial Control 5 Insurance 6 Internet Web 35 Legal 10 Literature 14 Manufacturing 8 Marketing PR 1 Math Data Mining 10 Multimedia 26 News 12 Other Industry 12 Professional Service 6 Public Service 5 Publishing Print 28 Real Estate 16 Religion Retail 6 Robotics AI 5 Science 64 Security 4 Social Sciences 4 Software 129 Supply Chain 23 Telecommunications 26 Translation 7 Transportation 10 Travel 4 Waste Management Weather 6 Wholesale and XML Technologies 238 .

Syndication services described in more detail below may operate in an XML environment through a syndication markup language which may support syndication specific functions through a corresponding data structure. One example of a currently used syndication markup language is RSS. However it will be appreciated that a syndication markup language SML as described herein may include any structure suitable for syndication including RSS RSS with extensions RSS RSS without certain elements RSS RSS with variations to elements RSS or various combinations of these e.g. RSS RSS . Furthermore an SML may incorporate features from other markup languages such as a financial markup language and or a secure markup language or may be used in cooperation with these other markup languages . More generally various combinations of XML schemas may be employed to provide syndication with enhanced services as described herein in an XML environment. It will be noted from the position of SML in the XML environment that SML may be XML based SGML based or employ some other grammar for services related to syndication. All such variations to the syndication markup language as may be usefully employed with the systems described herein are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure and may be used in a syndication system as that term is used herein.

According to the foregoing there is disclosed herein an enhanced syndication system. In one aspect the enhanced syndication system permits semantic manipulation of syndicated content. In another aspect the enhanced syndication system offers a social networking interface which permits various user interactions without a need to directly access underlying syndication technologies and the details thereof. In another aspect a wide variety of additional services may be deployed in combination with syndicated content to enable new uses of syndicated content. In another aspect persistence may be provided to transient syndicated content by the provision of a database or archive of data feeds and particularly the content of data feeds which may be searched filtered or otherwise investigated and manipulated in a syndication network. Such a use of a syndication system with a persistent archive of data feeds and items therein is now described in greater detail.

In one aspect the systems described herein may be used to scan historical feed data and locate relevant data feeds. For example filters may be applied to historical feed data to identify feeds of interest to a user. For example by searching for words such as optical and surgery in a universe of medical feeds a user may locate feeds relevant to optical laser surgery regardless of how those feeds are labeled or characterized by other users or content providers. In another complementary application numerous filters may be tested against known relevant feeds with a filter selected according to the results. This process may be iterative where a user may design a filter test it against relevant feeds apply to other feeds to locate new relevant feeds and repeat. Thus while real time or near real time filtering is one aspect of the systems described herein the filtering technology may be used with historical data to improve the yield of relevant material for virtually any topic of interest.

Another advantage of filtering historical data is the ability to capture transient discussions and topics that are not currently of interest. Thus a user interested in the 1996 U.S. Presidential campaign may find little relevant material on current data feeds but may find a high amount of relevant data in the time period immediately preceding the subsequent 2000 campaign. Similarly an arbitrary topic such as Egyptian history may have been widely discussed at some time in the past but receive very little attention today. The application of filters to historical feeds may provide search functionality similar to structured searching of static Web content. Thus there is disclosed herein a time or chronology oriented search tool for searching the contents of one or more sequential data feeds.

In another aspect the filters may be applied to a wide array of feeds such as news sources to build a real time magazine dedicated to a particular topic. The results may be further parsed into categories by source. For example for diabetes related filters the results may be parsed into groups such as medical and research journals patient commentaries medical practitioner Weblogs and so forth. The resulting aggregated data feed may also be combined with a readers form editor s overview highlights of current developments and so forth each of which may be an additional data feed for use for example in a Web based real time magazine or a new aggregated data feed.

In general the filter may apply any known rules for discriminating text or other media to identified data feeds. For example rules may be provided for determining the presence or absence of any word or groups of words. Wild card characters and word stems may also be used in filters. In addition if then rules or other logical collections of rules may be used. Proximity may be used in filters where the number of words between two related words is factored into the filtering process. Weighting may be applied so that certain words groups of words or filter rules are applied with different weight to the ultimate determination of whether to filter a particular item. External references from an item e.g. links to other external content either the existence of links or the domain or other aspects thereof may be used to filter incoming items of a data feed. External links to a data feed or data item may also be used such as by determining relevance by looking at the number of users who have linked to an item. This process may be expanded to measure the relevance of each link by examining the number of additional links by the linking entity. In other words if someone links to a reference and that user has no other links this may be less relevant than someone who links to the reference and has one hundred other links. This type of linking analysis system is provided for example by Technorati.

Filters may apply semantic analysis to determine or approximate the tone content or other aspects of an item by analyzing words and word patterns therein. Filters may also examine the source of an item such as whether it is from a .com top level domain or a .edu top level domain. The significance of a source designation as either increasing or decreasing the likelihood of passing through the filter may of course depend on the type of filter. Additionally synonyms for search terms or criteria may be automatically generated and applied alongside user specified filter criteria.

Metadata may be used to measure relevance. Data feeds and data items may be tagged with either subject matter codes or descriptive words and phrases to indicate content. Tags may be provided by an external trusted authority such as an editorial board or provided by an author of each item or provider of each data feed. These and any other rules capable of expression through a user interface may be applied to items or posts in data feeds to locate content of interest to a particularly user.

As noted above a user may also share data feeds aggregated data feeds and or filters with others. Thus in general there is provided herein a real time data mining method for use with data feeds such as RSS feeds. Through the intelligent filtering enabled by this data feed management system automatically updating information montages tailored to specific topics or users may be created that include any number of different perspectives from one to one hundred to one thousand or more. These real time montages may be adapted to any number of distinct customer segments of any size as well as business vertical market applications.

In another aspect filters may provide a gating technology for subsequent action. For example when a number of items are identified meeting a particular filter criteria specific automated actions may be taken in response. For example filter results or some predetermined number of filter results may trigger a responsive action such as displaying an alert on a user s monitor posting the results on a Weblog e mailing the results to others tagging the results with certain metadata or signaling for user intervention to review the results and status. Thus for example when a filter produces four results an e mail containing the results may be transmitted to a user with embedded links to the source material.

It will be appreciated that search results will be improved by the availability of well organized databases. While a number of Weblogs provide local search functionality and a number of aggregator services provide lists of available data feeds there does not presently exist a consumer level searchable database of feed contents at least nothing equivalent to what Google or Altavista provide for the Web. As such one aspect of the system described herein is a database of data feeds that is searchable by contents as well as metadata such as title and description. In a server used with the systems described herein the entire universe of known data feeds may be hashed or otherwise organized into searchable form in real time or near real time. The hash index may include each word or other symbol and any data necessary to locate it in a stream and in a post.

One useful parameter that may be included for searching is age. That is the age of a feed the age of posts within a feed and any other frequency data may be integrated into the database for use in structured user searches and the filters discussed in reference to .

As a further advantage data may be retrieved from other aggregators and data feeds on a well defined schedule. In addition to providing a very current view of data streams this approach prevents certain inconsistencies that occur with currently used aggregators. For example even for aggregator sites that push notification of updates to subscribers there may be inconsistencies between source data and data feed data if the source data is modified. While it is possible to renew notification when source material is updated this is not universally implemented in aggregators or Weblog software commonly employed by end users. Thus an aggregator may extract data from another aggregator that has not been updated. At the same time an aggregator or data source may prevent repeated access from the same location e.g. IP address . By accessing all of this data on a regular schedule that is acceptable to the respective data sources and aggregators and locally storing the results the server described herein may maintain a current and accurate view of data feeds. Additionally feeds may be automatically added by searching and monitoring in real time in a manner analogous to Web bots used by search engines for static content.

In another aspect a method of selling data feed services is disclosed herein. In this method RSS data which is actually static content in files may be serialized for distribution according to some time base or time standard such as one item every sixty seconds or every five minutes. In addition data may be filtered to select one item of highest priority at each transmission interval. In another configuration one update of all items may be pushed to subscribers every hour or on some other schedule in an effective batch mode. Optionally a protocol may be established between the server and clients that provides real time notification of new items. A revenue model may be constructed around the serialized data in which users pay increasing subscription rates for increasing timeliness with premium subscribers receiving nearly instantaneous updates. This in one aspect a data feed system is modified to provide time based data feeds to end users. This may be particularly useful for time sensitive information such as sports scores or stock prices. In another embodiment the end user feed may adhere to an RSS or other data feed standard but nonetheless use a tightly controlled feed schedule that is known to both the source and recipient of the data to create a virtual time based data feed.

Additional profile information such as user interests preferences and biographical data may also be optionally provided. This data and other user profile data may be used to target advertising associated with data feed sites or content. Thus a data feed management system is described herein in which ads are delivered that are of value to customers. In addition to self signaling through profile data the system may apply customer filtering behavioral analysis or any other analytic tools as applied to the user s feed selection and displayed posts to select appropriate advertisements for that user. The revenues from advertisements may be shared in a number of ways and may include shares of revenue to for example the operator of the data feed management system an intermediary that places an ad that results in a sale and or individual or institutional content providers who contributed to the relevant data feed audience.

In another aspect of the systems described herein feeds posts and or filters may be clustered and shared in a number of ways as described above. Particular configurations may be branded and sold as a value added service. Thus for example Warren Buffet s data feed selection and filtering may be of great interest to investors bankers and financiers. These selections may be sold to users who wish to see data feeds in the same manner as Warren Buffet. Similarly someone may be interested in the writings and readings of Martha Stewart Bill Clinton Bill O Reilly Bill Gates or Bill Belichick. Any of these individuals may brand and resell their selection of data feeds and design and use of filters. Similarly commercial political or other institutional entities may present an official RSS feed identity. This may be provided for free for promotional purposes such as promotion of a political party in a campaign or promotion of a seasonal sale event by a retailer. Similarly topical selections may be promoted by trade groups or individuals. For example a biotech or patent filter may be promoted by a patent law firm. In these applications the service sold or promoted may include either the filters and selections themselves which an end user may then modify or use as desired or an aggregated feed of results from the filters and selections without identification of the underlying criteria. Access to such an aggregated feed may be controlled through password based protection to a resulting Weblog or using the identity based RSS technology described above.

In one embodiment a user may either for a fee as described above or for free such as among a group of friends of interest based community of bloggers share not just search results but rules for finding those search results. In another application of this technology a buddy list or other community may share aggregator configurations and other data. In another application of this a recommendation engine may identify popular and successful search and filtering criteria that match a particular use profile.

In one aspect there is described herein a systematic approach to managing data feeds in an integrated and possibly Web based user interface. In a first step the user may process feeds including for example searching for analyzing and selecting feeds. In second step a user may process posts within a feed such as by filtering the posts as described above. In a third step the aggregated and filtered results may be displayed to the user. This systematic approach also readily accommodates subsequent processing of the resulting items such as by branding the technique for locating those items or by permitting sharing of the technique both of which are described above. Additional processing steps may also include for example aggregating results into an aggregated feed or any of the other processing steps identified in the foregoing detailed description.

A number of enhanced syndication systems providing security are now described in greater detail. While a number of examples of RSS are provided as embodiments of a secure syndication system it will be appreciated that RDF Atom or any other syndication language or OPML or other structured grammar including more generally the S definition set out above may be advantageously employed within a secure syndication framework as set forth herein.

Security may impact a number of features of a syndication system. For example a data stream system may use identity assignment and or encryption and or identity authentication and or decryption by public and private encryption keys for RSS items and similar structured data sets and data streams. The system may include notification of delivery as well as interpretation of delivery success failure notification of possible compromise of the end to end security system non repudiation and so on. The identity assignment and encryption as well as the authentication and decryption as well as the notification and interpretation may occur at any or multiple points in the electronic communication process some of which are illustrated and described below. A secure RSS system may be advantageously employed in a number of areas including but not limited to general business health care and financial services. Encryption may be employed in a number of ways within an RSS system including encryption and or authentication of the primary message notification to a sender or third party of receipt of messages interpretation of delivery method and processing of an RSS item during delivery.

In item level encryption of the primary message an item from an RSS source or similar source may be assigned an identifier which may be secure such as a digital signature and or encrypted with a key such as a private key in a Public Key Infrastructure PKI and transmitted to a recipient who may use a corresponding public key associated with a particular source to authenticate or decrypt the communication. A public key may be sent to the recipient simultaneously or in advance by a third party or collected by the recipient from a third party source such as a public network location provided by the source or a trusted third party. In other embodiments an intended recipient may provide a public key to a sender so that the sender which may be a content source aggregator or other RSS participant may encrypt data in a manner that may only be decrypted by the intended recipient. In this type of exchange the intended recipient s public key may similarly be published to a public web location e mailed directly from the recipient or provided by a trusted third party.

In tag level encryption of fields of data delimited within a message similar encryption techniques may be employed. By using tag level encryption security may be controlled for specific elements of a message and may vary from field to field within a single message.

In a notification system a secondary or meta return message may be triggered by receipt authentication and or decryption of the primary message by a recipient and sent by the recipient to the message originator or to a third party to provide reliable notification of receipt.

In interpretation of delivery information a sender or trusted intermediary may monitor the return message s and compare these with a list of expected return messages based for example on the list of previously or recently sent messages . This comparison information may be interpreted to provide information as to whether a communication was successful and in the case of communication to more than one recipient to determine how many and what percentage of communications were successful. The receipt of return messages that do not match the list of expected messages may be used to determine that fraudulent message are being sent to recipients perhaps using a duplicate of an authentic private key and that the security service may have been compromised.

In another aspect a series of encryption keys may be used by the source and various aggregators or other intermediaries in order to track distribution of items through an RSS network. This tracking may either use notification and interpretation as described herein or may simply reside in the finally distributed item which will require a specific order of keys to properly decrypt some or all of the item. If this system is being used primarily for tracking rather than security encryption and decryption information may be embedded directly into the RSS item either in one of the current fields or in a new field for carrying distribution channel information e.g. . . . .

In another aspect the message may be processed at any point during distribution. For example the communication process may include many stages of processing from the initial generation of a message through its ultimate receipt. Any two or more stages may be engaged in identity assignment and or encryption as well as the authentication and or decryption as well as notification and or interpretation. These stages may include but are not limited to message generation software such as word processors or blog software message conversion software for producing an RSS version of a message and putting it into a file open to the Internet relay by a messaging service such as one that might host message generation and RSS conversion software for many producers relay by a proxy server or other caching server relay by a notification server whose major function is notifying potential recipients to pull a message from a source and services for message receiving and aggregating and filtering multiple messages message display to recipients and message forwarding to further recipients.

In another aspect a message may include one or more digital signatures which may be authenticated with reference to for example the message contents or a hash or other digest thereof in combination with a public key for the purported author. Conversely a recipient of a digitally signed item may verify authenticity with reference to the message contents or a hash or other digest version thereof in combination with a private key of the recipient.

Referring now to the figures shows a number of participants interconnected through a data network any of which may participate in a secure RSS system as described herein. This may include content publishers or other data sources aggregators RSS servers mobile devices such as laptops cell phones portable computers pagers wireless e mail devices and so on as well as local networks sharing a network connection and any devices that might be connected to such a local network.

The security server may also or instead communicate with various other components of the syndication system to provide secure end to end communications. It will be appreciated that any number of security servers may be employed. A security server may employ a number of different techniques for secure communications. For example the security server may manage keys and key exchanges for security systems such as PKI Public Key Infrastructure PGP Pretty Good Privacy and so on. Security servers may provide key management and exchange independently or may operate with reference to a trusted third party such as Entrust or VeriSign. In one aspect the security system may be certificate based with each user and component that participates in the secure RSS system having its own certificate issued from or signed by a certificate authority which may again be a trusted third party .

Encryption based systems may use a wide array of cryptographic technologies including a number of those readily available in current commercially available operating systems and applications. This includes DES S MIME Exchange Server Security PGP RSA and various other forms of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography having various strengths i.e. length of keys or encryption blocks along with a number of techniques for managing keys certificates and associated access privileges. In general any of these may be applied to a secure syndication system for various purposes. For example data sources or other stored content may be stored in an encrypted form. As another example data may be encrypted for communication over an open network. As another example data may be encrypted for decryption by some subset of participants in the system thus providing selective access to data on a policy or explicit permission basis. As another example data may be authenticated using a digital signature that may be used to ensure that data has not been tampered with.

A number of schemas for RSS compliant S definitions are set out below showing a number of security features. In general this may include encryption of individual fields or sub portions of RSS s XML schema encryption of entire RSS items signatures for some or all of an RSS item or security information for the item specifying for example where and how to obtain credentials to review a secure RSS item encryption types trusted authority information and so on.

The above example shows use of a unique ID for an item assigned by its source as well as encrypted data enclosed within a restricted data tag . While the annotation indicates that the data has been encrypted with an intended recipient s public key it will be appreciated that the data may instead be encrypted using a private key such as to provide authentication of source through public key decryption. In other variations the restrictedData may provide decryption or key information for data encrypted within one of the other fields such as the author source title message body date time channel or any other field within RSS or more generally the S definition described above. In other embodiments such as the message level encryption described above the entire message optionally with the exception of certain header information used for identification may be encrypted using the various techniques described herein. The following exchange of messages provides another example of use of encryption in which a secure token may be received from a subscriber 

As noted above encryption may be employed more generally within messages or among participants in a secure syndication system to achieve a wide range of possible new uses of syndication Various uses of a secure syndication system are described below. It will be appreciated that these systems may be deployed using a number of cryptographic techniques of varying degrees of strength using an exercise of ordinary skill in the relevant arts.

In one aspect data feeds or aggregated data feeds provided from a server for the system described herein may include a security layer for securely transmitting RSS or other feeds so that only authorized subscribers can decode the feed. A closely related concept in cryptography is the concept of identity. An identity service or layer may also be added to RSS or other feeds from the server used with the systems described herein. This service may for example provide for digital signatures of feeds that allow verification of identity or encryption that can only be decoded by users having a specific key or identity .

Keys or passwords may be used to control access to data feeds and to authenticate user identity. Various applications may use for example symmetric encryption for security and asymmetric public private key encryption for identity. A number of such techniques are known to those of skill in the art and may be usefully employed with the systems described herein. Certificates may also be employed. A certificate is effectively a unique identifier of identity that can be verified through a trusted third party. The certificate is typically installed on a user computer and enables a negotiation of a secure connection with other similarly configured devices. VeriSign provides certificates commonly used in a number of software applications and Public Key Infrastructure applications and these certificates are suitable for use with the enhanced security identity layer described herein.

In one embodiment there is disclosed herein a certificate based data feed. In this embodiment a user certificate may be embedded into a user RSS post so that the source can be affirmatively identified. Similarly a subscriber to a feed may be identified by reference to an installed certificate. In one aspect RSS communications may be securely restricted to specific sources and recipients with decryption of data occurring for example through a one way key exchange between participants.

In another aspect useful applications may be built upon a secure RSS system. If coherent access to a data feed is restricted to a specified source and recipient such as through key exchange or other encryption based negotiation then sensitive materials may be posted as an RSS feed and subscribed to by authorized recipients. For example an entire patient medical history may be stored as a secure RSS feed. Similarly tax filings legal files or other private documents or collections of documents may be stored as an RSS feed with the owner granting transient or revocable access thereto for specific purposes. Returning to the medical history example a business traveler in a foreign city may become ill and provide immediate access to medical records for a treating physician. As a significant advantage over existing methods for file handling an owner s discretion to grant access is not in any way inhibited by a current holder of physical files. Thus where a patient might ordinarily have to provide written authorization to a holder of medical records to release same or worse still physically retrieve the files in person a patient with medical records stored in a secure RSS data format can grant access anywhere at any time and manage access in any manner most suitable to the patient s treatment.

In another application of secure RSS data access may be role based. Thus access may be granted for example to registered physicians. If a physician s license is revoked the physician s certificate or identity may be updated immediately. As a consequence the physician may be denied access to a patient s records even if the patient is not yet aware that the physician s license to practice medicine has been suspended or revoked. In a role based system a number of feeds may also be configured to provide varying degrees of access to different users. Thus for example all personal records may be stored as a number of RSS data feeds with attorneys have access to one data set law enforcement officers another data set accountants another data set and so forth. Optionally the data may constitute a single feed of data with different portions of the feed encrypted differently according to desired access. In another aspect of role based data feed systems a particular data feed may be filtered or display thereof varied according to the recipient of the data. Thus a radiologist may receive a different view of medical data than an internist a surgeon or a nurse.

Roles or identities may be used in other ways. For example feed selection may be governed in part by feed source. Thus a user may only want to review feeds from for example registered doctors or certified financial planners. The status of these and other professionals may be associated with respective certificates so that status certification or any other criteria may be determined along with identity when reviewing sources of feeds and or aggregated feeds. Thus there is also disclosed herein a technique for ranking selecting or filtering feeds and or posts according to a criteria whose locus of evaluation does not exist within the network but can be verified with reference to data in the feeds and or posts. In another aspect there is disclosed herein a technique for ranking selecting or filtering feeds and or posts according to a criteria that is verified with reference to a trusted third party such as through a certificate. In another aspect a filter may be applied to feeds and or posts that only accepts items from sources with verifiable identities.

Security keys that can be used by end user computers to authenticate the signaling message itself or elements within the signaled message e.g. author time and source or the signaled about message. Security may be used to enable any number of cryptographically based functions including authenticity of a source non repudiation of content or time such as for reliable date stamping confidentiality of a message or other content for which access may be limited to an individual reader a list of specifically identified readers or readers associated with a formal group to name just a few examples. Security may also enable subscription type services in which messages are made available on a subscription basis that controls keys used to decrypt contents rather than physical access to a feed.

The external clients may be for example authorized readers of content maintained on the syndication server . The other external clients may be public or anonymous readers of content maintained on the syndication server which may be different from the content provided to authorized readers. In one embodiment two physically separate syndication servers may be provided for more complete and secure separation of public and private content. In another embodiment the syndication server may include two separate logical servers. The syndication server may gather aggregate and or index content from the internal data feed s as well as any number of external data feeds . Data retrieved from the external data feeds may be scanned or otherwise reviewed before indexing or republication through the syndication server . In one aspect the syndication server may provide a public source of scanned or otherwise reviewed cleansed or secured data to external clients . The syndication server may also provide secure verifiable date or time stamping for external references. The syndication server may provide any of the user interfaces or other functions described above consistent with a syndication platform.

In another aspect a secure syndication infrastructure may include for example web based aggregator and a database such as the syndication server above behind a firewall such as the firewall above. Access to the aggregator by external readers which may be external clients or above may be through SSL security or other strong encryption from the browser reader to the web based aggregator. The syndication server may maintain a certificate system or employ a third party certificate service not shown such as VeriSign to authenticate itself to visitors or to authenticate visitors.

In one aspect the secure syndication system may be employed by an enterprise to regulate communications to authorized users such as employs and the general public while permitting syndicated content to be supplemented with external content that has been reviewed for security or other parameters appropriateness relevance reliability etc. . In another aspect the secure syndication system may be offered as a service to publishers of syndicated content in which publishers may control access to content or employ other security features of the system .

It will be appreciated that the syndication server may include an array of syndication related sub systems. For example the syndication server may operate one or more spiders that locate new syndicate content throughout the Internet and a corresponding index or database of such content. The syndication server may provide a search engine for public and or private use of indexed content known data feeds known authors and so forth. The syndication server may provide aggregator and or filter functions such as those described above. The syndication server may also provide publication of syndicated content. In one aspect a browser may display both secure and insecure feeds within a single interface and may either visually distinguish between these feeds or provide no visual distinction. For example the feeds may be prominently grouped within separate areas of a user interface labeled as secure or insecure or the feeds may be grouped together but shaded or colored differently according to security status or the feeds may appear identical and be grouped together.

A certificate and encryption manager may communicate with one or more other entities within the system to provide secure data transmission authentication authorization and any other functions that might be associated with cryptographic capabilities. The system may employ approved sources uses and user lists to control access to data as well as accessing to writing editing posting capabilities within the secure RSS system . The browser may be any conventional browser used to view syndicated content within the system .

A source spider or bot may continuously search the World Wide Web and RSS feeds files for new subject matter outside the system firewall . A source authenticator and or gatekeeper which may be for example within the firewall the syndication server or somewhere else within the system may review sources identified by the spider using for example the approved lists and transmit approved references to the database of sources and items. A security system such as SSL can be used to secure all communications that occur outside the firewall and may provide a secure externally accessible RSS system. Access and sessions may be for example certificate based using internally managed certificates or certificates issued by a trusted external source such as VeriSign or Entrust.

Security may be extended to all RSS functions including pinging posting distribution RSS channels and aggregators and reading. The system can offer a secure write point behind a firewall so that a blog or other RSS based content provider is secure. The system may also mix secure and unsecured elements such as by referencing external data feeds and internal data feeds . The external feeds may be either secured by processing them through the gatekeeper or may be used within the system along with a tag or other identifier noting that they are external untrusted references. Similarly the system could provide administrative tools to permit control of access to outside sources by users of the system or according to system privileges or policies.

The security system could be deployed or used differently for other functions such as secure pinging through a secure session between parties. It should also be appreciated that different network communication mediums may have different security session and communication characteristics. An RSS system with session and security capabilities may effectively incorporate any features from these complementary systems e.g. electronic mail ftp instant messaging peer to peer file sharing HTTP browsing that might be usefully combined with the RSS systems. Thus for example an RSS channel may be configured to provide continuous presence in a manner similar to IRC or instant messaging systems. RSS channels or items may have file attachments made available for download using hierarchical path names and file transfer capabilities of ftp. In another aspect users or participants could have continuous presence like instant messaging which may significantly improve social aspects of the systems described herein. Peer to peer networking techniques such as the BitTorrent techniques for managing upload and download traffic for popular content may be incorporated into the managed RSS system described herein.

In one aspect all RSS communications may be made secure. The pinger of a conventional RSS system may effectively become a session manager where sessions are used to carry RSS data. Within a session encryption keys or challenge response based encryption communications may be transferred before or in parallel with other feed based communications. The session manager may provide notifications of updates function as a carrier of core content and provide traffic management for an RSS based communication medium. Additionally network management like protocols may be employed to distribute content e.g. feeds or items and manage traffic e.g. ping requests within an active RSS network. Thus for example pinging responsibility may be distributed among a number of different servers that function like domain name servers in TCP IP systems. Regional participants could handle regional traffic and transfer or share ping load during busy times or route around congestion points. This offers significant advantages over current ping systems in which pingers simply drop excess ping requests.

In another aspect digital rights management systems may be employed with policy based or authority or permission based access to RSS content. Additional functions and relationships may be generally as depicted in the figure and may include any of the system components described above for use with an RSS system.

These and other variations may be used in a secure syndication system as described herein. A number of basic syndication operations are now considered in greater detail.

Two widely known message definitions used for Internet syndication are RSS 2.0 RSS and the Atom Syndication Format Draft Version 9 Atom as submitted to the IETF on Jun. 7 2005 in the form of an Internet Draft . The system disclosed herein may include a message definition referred to herein variously as the S definition or the Enhanced Syndication Services ESS definition which may incorporate features of and may supplement features of these and any other syndication message definitions or other definitions useful for enhanced services as described generally above. Any message conforming to the S definition may be referred to as an S message or an ESS message. RSS and Atom may be viewed as species of the S definition.

The S definition may be described in terms of XML or any other suitable standardized or proprietary format. XML for example is a widely accepted standard of the Internet community that may conveniently offer a human readable and machine readable format for an S definition. Alternatively the S definition may be described according to another syntax and or formal grammar. Generally any commonly accepted expression of the S definition may be used with the systems described herein.

The message instance may conform to a message definition which may be an abstract typed definition. The abstract typed definition may be expressed for example in terms of an XML schema which may without limitation comprise XML s built in Document Type Definition DTD XML Schema RELAX NG and so forth. The information may also or instead be represented as a set of message instances wherein each message instance in the set may be atomic and wherein the message instances in the set may be ordered and or may naturally occur as a series. It should be appreciated that the information may change over time and that any change in the information may naturally be associated with a change in a particular message instance and or a change in the set of message instances .

The data feed may be associated with one or more message instances comprising metadata associated with the data feed and or the message instance s . The data feed may conversely be associated with a message instance including an outline of the set of message instances . The outline of the set of message instances may identify some or all of the set of message instances and or may include excerpts of one or more message instance from within the set of message instances . Similarly a plurality of data feeds may be outlined within a message instance associated with that data feed s .

When the message instance resides in the set of message instances the message instance may be referred to as an entry. When the message instances includes an outline such as message instance or message instance the message instance may be referred to as a list. It should be appreciated however that the words list and outline may be used interchangeably in some descriptions. When the message instance specifically comprises metadata associated with the data feed such as message instance the message instance may be referred to as a channel definition or channel. When the list associated with message instance contains metadata associated with more than one data feed the message instance may be referred to as a metachannel aggregate channel or channel guide. It should be appreciated that any message instance may include metadata. When the message instance specifically comprises a URI or other resolvable reference that is associated with a retrieval location for a feed the message instance may be referred to as a subscription request. The retrieval location may without limitation comprise a network address a network protocol a path a virtual path and or a filename.

The S definition may include any or all of the elements of the following standards and drafts all of which are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference RSS 2.0 Atom Syndication Format as presented in the IETF Internet Draft Version 9 of the Atom Syndication Format OPML 1.0 XML Signature Syntax as published in the W3C Recommendation of 12 Feb. 2002 the XML Encryption Syntax as published in the W3C Recommendation of 10 Dec. 2002 the Common Markup for Micropayment per fee links as published in the W3C Working Draft of 25 Aug. 1999 .

The above description of the particular elements of the S definition is intended to be illustrative of the types and semantics of the elements supported by the S definition that may be used to provide enhanced syndication services. As such the above description is not intended to be limiting as to the types of elements that might be used or the particular nomenclature therefore.

The S definition describes a message format that may enable Internet syndication operations. An S message according to the S definition may be associated with one or more of XML a feature of RSS a feature of Atom a feature of OPML a micropayment electronic commerce a representation of medical information the representation of public information the representation of private information the representation of protected information a tag for a crawler versioning and or a change log a digital signature basic authentication digest authentication may associated with encryption a license term a route trace a permalink an enclosure or file attachment a indication of time or a timestamp e commerce searching filtering clustering a database security video a device a user interface a rule non syndication technologies social networking a vertical market downstream processing semantic processing and or a source.

Schemas typically have required and optional elements. In one embodiment of the S definition any or all elements may be optional. Thus any message comprising one or more element of the S definition may be a valid S message. In other embodiments one or more elements may be required such as elements used to support underlying syndication functions.

An instance of the data delivery method may be specified in terms of a type. Without specifying a particular implementation the type may indicate whether the instance of the data delivery method includes the push facility the pull facility the unicast facility and or the multicast facility . The depicted types include push pull unicast multicast unicast push unicast pull multicast push multicast pull.

Without limitation in embodiments a unicast push instance of the data delivery method may include as an SMTP over TCP IP session a unicast pull instance of the data delivery method may include an HTTP over TCP IP session a multicast push instance of the data delivery method may include an RTP over UDP IP session and or a multicast pull instance of the data delivery method may include a session of a facility that pools a plurality of identical pull requests and transmits a single response to the requests via a multicast channel.

In some embodiments the type of the instance of the data delivery method may be static for example and without limitation an entry in a configuration file may specify that the type is to be unicast pull.

In other embodiments the type of the instance of the data delivery method may be dynamic and thus may vary from time to time. For example and without limitation it should be appreciated that an influx of a plurality of requests from one of more client facilities via the unicast pull instance of the data delivery method may overload a server facility attempting to service the plurality of requests. This overload may result in delayed or denied service to the one or more client facilities. Likewise it is should be appreciated that the multicast push instance of the data delivery method may be used to provide service to the one or more clients in anticipation of the plurality of requests perhaps obviating the need for the plurality of requests and concurrently eliminating the potential overload that may occur in the unicast pull instance. It follows that from time to time and in some embodiments changing the type of the instance of the data delivery method from unicast pull to multicast push may avert an impending overload. Generally systems according to the present invention may support any suitable dynamic substitution of one type of the instance of the data delivery method for another type of the instance of the data delivery method .

It will be appreciated that the distinction between push and pull communications may become blurred in a system such as contemporary RSS networks where a pinger provides update information on RSS channels which may be used by an RSS intermediary such as an aggregator to simulate push by signaling to readers when new content is available even where the content sources is strictly speaking a pure pull source that simply provides channel items in response to requests.

In the following discussion of a single headed arrow may indicate an instance of the data delivery method . The direction of the arrow may indicate the direction in which the S message is usually transferred but may not imply the type of the instance of the data delivery method . A line without an arrowhead may indicate an association between two depicted components but may not imply how that association is implemented or whether the two components are operatively coupled. In one aspect characterize operations of the syndication layer of an enhanced syndication services system.

There may exist one element associated with each in the . The may contain any number of elements. Each element may be representative of a particular revision of the associated file. It should be noted that each may contain a element specifying the name identifier and or location of the file containing that revision of the associated file. In this example it should be appreciated that revision 1.2 of the patent.doc file is stored in a file named patent.doc.1.2 and that revision 1.1 of the patent.doc file is stored at http www.bigarchive.com patent.doc.1.1 . In the for the patent.xls file it is shown that revision 1.2 of the file is the result of a merge between revisions 1.1.1 and 1.1 of the file. Revision 1.1.1 is itself the result of a branch from revision 1.1. Generally the version history may support a representation of a manual revision an automatic revision a branch a merge a tag or symbolic revision an attribute or element representative of a type of revision for example whether the revision is manual or automatic a set of associated files across which a tag or symbolic revision may be applied and so forth. For example revision 1.2 of the patent.doc file is shown to be an automatic revision caused by a software crash event. It should be appreciated that this S message may be considered to be a list and in particular the revision history elements may be considered to be outlines.

In embodiments aspects of the syndication facility may be presented to an application developer in the form of a syndication service API.
