title: Microchip ring trap for cold atoms or molecules
abstract: A microchip ring trap for cold atoms or neutral molecules consists of a particular multi-layer layout of wires on a microchip. These conductive wires may be produced by photolithography on a substrate (e.g. gold on sapphire). There are four wires crucial to the design, essentially a pair of “two-wire waveguides”. These wires are laid out on concentric circles with the inner and outer most wires on lower level of the chip, and the middle pair of wires on the top layer (the chip surface).

The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

The present invention relates generally to interferometry and more specifically to a symmetric circular magnetic waveguide for cold neutral atoms using current carrying wires on a microchip. The waveguide is ideal to make an ultra sensitive gyroscope using atom interferometry and the Sagnac effect. Either cold thermal atoms quantum degenerate gasses e.g. Bose Einstein condensates BECs or molecules with a magnetic dipole moment may be used. This technology can also be used in general inertial force sensing accelerometers gravimeters atomic clocks electromagnetic field sensing and quantum computing.

Important background to the present invention is found in the following U.S. patents of interest that are incorporated herein by reference are 

U.S. Pat. No. 6 476 383 Esslinger et al. Nov. 5 2002 entitled Device and method for generating and manipulating coherent matter waves and

U.S. Pat. No. 4 874 942 Clauser Oct. 17 1989 entitled Rotation acceleration and gravity sensors using quantum mechanical matter wave interferometry with neutral atoms and molecules.

The Esslinger and Clauser references are of interest in that they set forth how a neutral atom and or molecule matter wave interferometer and or set of interferometers can be used as an inertial sensor with a sensitivity exceeding that of conventional mechanical sensors and multiple circuit optical interferometers including ring lasers by many powers of ten. An interferometer in which matter wave propagation beam paths enclose a finite area will sense rotations via the Sagnac effect. One with the paths displaced from each other will sense acceleration plus gravity. The matter wave energy and mass dependence of the phase shifts that are due to rotation and acceleration are different. Thus a pair of interferometers with different energies and or masses can perform simultaneous independent measurements of rotation and acceleration.

The present invention is a symmetric circular magnetic waveguide for cold neutral atoms using current carrying wires on a microchip.

The invention consists of a particular multi layer layout of wires on a microchip. These conductive wires may be produced by photolithography on a substrate e.g. gold on sapphire . There are four wires crucial to the design essentially a pair of two wire waveguides .

The present invention includes a symmetric circular magnetic waveguide for cold neutral atoms using current carrying wires on a microchip. This design is similar to Chapman et al PRL 2001 87.270401 but on a microchip. The waveguide is ideal to make an ultra sensitive gyroscope using atom interferometry and the Sagnac effect. Either cold thermal atoms or quantum degenerate gasses e.g. Bose Einstein condensates BECs may be used.

The invention consists of a particular multi layer layout of wires on a microchip. These conductive wires may be produced by photolithography on a substrate e.g. gold on sapphire . There are four wires crucial to the design see below essentially a pair of two wire waveguides . These wires are laid out on concentric circles with the inner and outer most wires on the lower level of the chip and the middle pair of wires on the top layer the chip surface .

In the diagram above we show a symmetric minimum which is achieved by having the two two wire waveguides at 90 degrees with respect to each other and at 45 degrees with respect to the chip normal vector with the wires in the bottom layer running approximately 3 times the current of the wires in the upper layer. More complex asymmetric minima can be achieved by varying this angle and these currents. One can use this waveguide for cold thermal i.e. non degenerate atoms as is or for a BEC by applying one of the following methods to reduce Majorana transitions. Either apply an azimuthal bias field in the form of an axial wire in the center of the chip forces the geometry to be purely circular or adjusting the currents in the wires to make a time averaged orbiting potential move the minimum in a circle e.g. Arnold A S 2003 J. Phys. B. 37 L29 L33 . The circular minimum waveguide is the same in both strength shape and position under the following conditions the two wires on the inside are energized the two wires on the outside are energized all four wires are energized at half the currents of the previous cases any situation in between adjusting the currents appropriately. Thus it is possible to create a circular guide without ever crossing a lead that would lead to spurious phase shifts by switching the guide from one two wire pair to the other see . Essentially there are two circular waveguides. As the atoms travel along one they are slowly switched to the other track without any or only minor perturbations. This allows the inhomogeneities due to the leads to be moved to have the least affect on the atoms or particles.

It is important to note that it is the concept and geometery that are important not the specific scale. For example the design is easily generalized to include different wire sizes and shapes different overall scale and different spacing between the wires. The power source produces a 1 2 amp direct current where the voltage is determined by the resistance of the wires.

This wire layout includes 15 micron vertical separation and a 5 micron space representing a difference in the concentric radius and this allows a completely circular on chip Sagnac interferometer that doesn t suffer from defects due to crossing wire leads. It is versatile and adaptable for use with Bose Einstein condensates or non degenerate cold atoms. The traps can be exceedingly strong up to 20 T mor 10 MHz for Rb for reasonable parameters . The atoms can be initially captured and cooled in situ by using a U shape quadrupole trap or evaporative cooled in a Z shape Ioffe Pritchard trap. This is accomplished simply by either the addition of an extra wire or taking advantage of the leads to one of the circular waveguides see . The center of the chip inside the circular guides there is a hole to allow access to the leads of the inner guide and allow for an axial pin for a bias field. This need not be a hole if contacts can be grown through the substrate to the back of the chip.

There are two known ways to prevent losses from spin flip at a zero in the magnetic field. Each way creates a variation on the microchip design. Arnold A S 2003 J. Phys. B. 37 L29 L33 

As mentioned above the present trap uses the magnetic dipole moment of atoms or particles and a magnetic field gradient for trapping.

The two electrodes and from the top of are the outer ring electrodes and electrodes and are the inner electrodes which are all supplied with current from the chip electronics .

While the invention has been described in its presently preferred embodiment it is understood that the words which have been used are words of description rather than words of limitation and that changes within the purview of the appended claims may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention in its broader aspects.
