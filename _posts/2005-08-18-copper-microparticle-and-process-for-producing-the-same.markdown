The present invention relates to copper microparticles and a process for producing the same and particularly to copper microparticles suitable for production of electrodes of laminated ceramics capacitors circuits of printed wiring boards etc. and a process for producing the copper microparticles.

Metallic copper microparticles are inexpensive materials having good electric conductivity and are widely used as materials for ensuring electric conduction such as circuit forming materials for printed wiring boards various electrical contact materials outer electrode materials of capacitors etc. and recently they are used also for inner electrodes of laminated ceramics capacitors. The laminated ceramics capacitors can give a larger capacity as compared with capacitors of other types such as electrolytic capacitors and film capacitors and are superior in mountability and high in safety and stability and thus they have spread rapidly. With recent miniaturization of electronic equipments the laminated ceramics capacitors are also being miniaturized. However for maintaining large capacity it is necessary to miniaturize them without reducing the number of lamination of ceramics sheet and there is a limit in thinning of the sheet from the point of strength. Therefore the miniaturization of laminated ceramics capacitors is realized by thinning the inner electrodes using fine metallic copper particles.

In order to use metallic copper microparticles as materials for ensuring electric conduction usually copper microparticles are dispersed in a solvent or mixed with a binder such as epoxy resin thereby to prepare a paste paint or ink namely a fluid composition such as a copper paste paint or ink. For example in forming a circuit of a printed wiring board the fluid composition is coated on a substrate in the pattern of circuit or electrode by means of screen printing ink jet printing or the like and then heated to fusion bond the metallic copper microparticles thereby forming fine electrodes. Furthermore for formation of an inner electrode of laminated ceramics capacitors the fluid composition is coated on thin ceramics sheets and these sheets are laminated and then fired by heating to form inner electrodes.

As a process for producing metallic copper microparticles there is known a process of reducing copper oxide with a hydrazine reducing agent in an aqueous liquid medium containing a protective colloid such as gum arabic Patent Document 1 and in an example of this process there are obtained copper microparticles having an average particle diameter in the range of 0.4 32 m as measured by an electron microscope. There is further known a process which comprises precipitating copper hydroxide from an aqueous solution of a copper salt adding a reducing sugar to the resulting copper hydroxide to reduce it to copper suboxide cuprous oxide and then reducing the cuprous oxide to metallic copper with a hydrazine reducing agent Patent Document. 2 . This document discloses that when a complexing agent such as Rochelle salt amino acid ammonia or an ammonium compound is added to the aqueous solution of copper salt copper ion can be stably dissolved and hence the addition of complexing agent is effective. In an example of this process copper microparticles having a particle size distribution of 0.5 0.1 m to 3.1 0.3 m are obtained. Another process is known according to which in the process of Patent Document 2 gelatin as a protective colloid is added to the aqueous solution of copper salt and is further added during subsequent growth of nucleus particles of metallic copper Patent Document 3 . In an example of this process there are obtained copper microparticles having a particle size distribution of 0.90 0.05 m to 5.14 0.25 m as measured by microtrack dynamic light scattering method .

According to the conventional processes although fine metallic copper particles can be obtained primary particles of metallic copper are produced not in a monodispersed state but in conspicuously agglomerated state and besides secondary particles are in the form of particle lump and are uneven in size and shape. Therefore they are not sufficient in dispersibility in the fluid composition and when circuits electrodes etc. are formed filling of them is inferior and defects are apt to occur. Thus it is difficult to form thin inner electrodes of capacitors or fine circuits of printed wiring boards. Accordingly copper microparticles are demanded which contain substantially no agglomerated particles and are regular in shape and excellent in dispersibility in spite of being fine metallic copper microparticles.

Furthermore there is the following problem. That is if a protective colloid is used as a dispersion stabilizer in producing metallic copper microparticles the protective colloid attaches or adsorbs to the surface of the copper microparticles and they can be obtained in monodispersed state without causing agglomeration of the copper microparticles. However the copper microparticles produced are highly dispersed due to the presence of the protective colloid and hence even if a flocculating agent is added it is difficult to subject the copper microparticles to solid liquid separation from a liquid medium in which anion and cation resulting from additives such as pH adjustor are present in a large amount in addition to the starting copper compound residue of the reducing agent and the protective colloid and thus an ultrafiltration that is unsuitable for mass production must be carried out.

As a result of intensive research conducted by the inventors on the starting material of copper compound and additives such as protective colloid in an attempt to solve the above problems it has been found that if metallic copper microparticles are produced by using a monovalent copper oxide as a starting copper compound or produced through two stage reactions of producing a monovalent copper oxide by reducing a divalent copper oxide and then re reducing the monovalent copper oxide as in Patent Documents 2 and 3 the monovalent copper oxide is highly susceptible to reduction and the reduction reaction proceeds very rapidly control of the reaction rate is difficult even when a complexing agent which forms a complex with copper oxide and controls the rate of reaction with reducing agent therefore crystallites of metallic copper are produced in the reaction mixture in uneven distribution of concentration and hence particle growth also becomes uneven and as a result the shape of copper microparticles becomes irregular and production of agglomerated particles cannot be inhibited and besides the production of agglomerated particles cannot be inhibited even if there is present a protective colloid which controls agglomeration of copper microparticles by attaching or adsorbing to the surface of the copper microparticles produced. It has further been found that a divalent copper oxide is lower in reduction rate than a monovalent copper oxide and when a complexing agent is added to the reaction mixture a small amount of crystallites of metallic copper are produced and uniform particle growth proceeds in accordance with progress of reduction reaction with the crystallites acting as nuclei and furthermore when a protective colloid is added there are obtained fine copper microparticles which are in the monodispersed state containing substantially no agglomerated particles and are regular in shape of particles. Thus the present invention has been accomplished.

Moreover the inventors have found that copper microparticles can be flocculated when metallic copper microparticles are produced in the presence of a protective colloid and then a protective colloid scavenger is added to the reaction mixture and the copper microparticles can be filtered off even by a usual means. Thus the present invention has been accomplished.

That is the present invention includes 1 a process for producing copper microparticles which comprises mixing a divalent copper oxide with a reducing agent in a liquid medium in the presence of a complexing agent and a protective colloid to thereby produce metallic copper microparticles and 2 a process for producing copper microparticles which comprises mixing a divalent copper oxide with a reducing agent in a liquid medium in the presence of a complexing agent and a protective colloid without including a step of producing a monovalent copper oxide from a divalent copper oxide.

The present invention further includes 3 a process for producing copper microparticles which comprises producing metallic copper microparticles in the presence of a completing agent and a protective colloid according to the above 1 or 2 thereafter adding a protective colloid scavenger to the liquid medium to flocculate the metallic copper microparticles and then fractionating the metallic copper microparticles.

The present invention further includes 4 copper microparticles obtainable by the above processes and having an average particle diameter D of 0.005 2.0 m as measured by an electron microscope an average particle diameter d of 0.005 2.0 m as measured by dynamic light scattering method and a ratio d D of 0.7 2. Moreover the present invention includes 5 copper microparticles having an average particle diameter D of 0.005 0.5 m as measured by an electron microscope an average particle diameter d of 0.005 0.5 m as measured by dynamic light scattering method and a ratio d D of 0.7 1.5.

Furthermore the present invention includes 6 a fluid composition containing at least the copper microparticles of the above 4 and 5 and a dispersion medium.

The copper microparticles obtained by the process of the present invention are fine contain substantially no agglomerated particles and are regular in particle shape and excellent in dispersibility. The copper microparticles are useful as electrode materials of electronic equipments etc. and when a fluid composition containing the copper microparticles is used for inner electrodes of laminated ceramics capacitors circuits of printed wiring boards and other electrodes there are obtained thin and high density electrodes and the like.

Furthermore when a protective colloid scavenger is used less leakage occurs in filtration yield of the copper microparticles increases and filtering and washing time can be shortened.

The present invention relates to a process for producing copper microparticles which comprises mixing a divalent copper oxide with a reducing agent in a liquid medium in the presence of a complexing agent and a protective colloid to reduce the copper oxide thereby producing metallic copper microparticles. In the present invention it is important to use a divalent copper oxide as a starting material and a monovalent copper oxide such as copper suboxide cuprous oxide is not used. Further it is preferred to produce metallic microparticles through a reaction of one stage by carrying out reduction under the conditions where a monovalent copper oxide is not produced from a divalent copper oxide. The term divalent copper oxide in the present invention means a copper oxide in which valence of copper is divalent Cu and includes cupric oxide cupric hydroxide and mixtures thereof. The divalent copper oxide may properly contain impurities such as other metals metal compounds and non metallic compounds but preferably contains substantially no monovalent copper oxide except for in an unavoidable amount. Furthermore the divalent copper oxide preferably has an X ray diffraction peak belonging to cupric oxide and more preferably has an average crystallite diameter in the range of 20 500 nm more preferably 50 200 nm calculated from X ray diffraction peak at plane 110 of cupric oxide using the following formula 1. When the average crystallite diameter of the divalent copper oxide is at least within the above range desired metallic copper microparticles can be produced. If it is less than the above range particle diameter is small and crystallinity is low and hence dissolution rate of cupric oxide increases and it becomes difficult to control the reduction reaction rate unless a large amount of the complexing agent is used. On the other hand if it is more than the above range particle diameter is large and crystallinity is good and hence dissolution rate decreases and unreacted cupric oxide is apt to remain in the copper microparticles unless the reduction reaction time is prolonged. Thus the larger average crystallite diameter is also not preferred. The process for producing the divalent copper oxide is not limited and there may be used those which are industrially produced for example by electrolytic method chemical conversion method heat oxidization method thermal decomposition method indirect wet method or the like. cos Formula 1

In the present invention the sequence of addition of respective materials is not limited in mixing of a divalent copper oxide and a reducing agent so long as a complexing agent and a protective colloid are present and there may be employed for example 1 a method of adding the divalent copper oxide and the reducing agent simultaneously and in parallel with each other to a liquid medium containing the complexing agent and the protective colloid 2 a method of adding the reducing agent to a liquid medium containing the complexing agent protective colloid and divalent copper oxide 3 a method of adding the complexing agent and the reducing agent simultaneously and in parallel with each other to a liquid medium containing the protective colloid and the divalent copper oxide 4 a method of adding a mixture of the complexing agent and the reducing agent to a liquid medium containing the protective colloid and the divalent copper oxide etc. The methods 3 and 4 are preferred because the reaction can easily be controlled and the method 4 is particularly preferred. The divalent copper oxide reducing agent complexing agent and protective colloid may be previously suspended or dissolved in a liquid medium before using them for reduction reaction. The term adding simultaneously and in parallel with each other means to add the divalent copper oxide and the reducing agent or the complexing agent and the reducing agent separately from each other and at the same time in the reaction period and includes addition of both of them continuously during the reaction period and besides addition of one or both of them intermittently.

As the liquid medium for example an aqueous liquid medium or an organic solvent liquid medium such as alcohol preferably an aqueous liquid medium is used. The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of 10 C. to the boiling point of the liquid medium used because the reaction proceeds easily more preferably in the range of 40 95 C. because fine metallic copper microparticles are obtained further preferably in the range of 60 95 C. especially preferably in the range of 80 95 C. It is preferred to previously adjust the pH of the reaction solution to a range of 3 12 with an acid or alkali because settling of divalent copper oxide can be inhibited and uniform reaction can be performed. The reaction time can be set by controlling with addition time of the materials such as reducing agent and is suitably for example about 10 minutes to 6 hours.

The complexing agent used in the present invention is considered to act in the course of the copper ion dissolving out of the divalent copper oxide or the divalent copper oxide being reduced to produce metallic copper and is a compound capable of forming a copper complex compound by the bonding of a donor atom of ligand with copper ion or metallic copper and the donor atom includes for example nitrogen oxygen sulfur or the like.

 5 Examples of salts or derivatives of the above compounds are alkali metal salts such as sodium citrate sodium potassium tartrate sodium hypophosphite and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate and esters of carboxylic acids phosphoric acids sulfonic acid and the like.

At least one of these complexing agents can be used. The amount of the complexing agents used can be optionally set and 0.01 200 parts by weight for 1000 parts by weight of the divalent copper oxide is preferred because the effects of the present invention can be easily obtained. When the amount of the complexing agent is reduced within the above range primary particles of the copper microparticles can be made smaller and when it is increased within the above range primary particles can be made larger. The amount is more preferably in the range of 0.1 200 parts by weight and further preferably in the range of 0.5 150 parts by weight.

In the present invention complexing agents containing at least one atom selected from nitrogen and oxygen as a donor atom are preferred since the effect of the present invention can be easily obtained. Specifically more preferred is at least one compound selected from amines nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds nitrites and cyano compounds carboxylic acids ketones phosphoric acids and phosphoric acid based compounds amino acids aminopolycarboxylic acids alkanolamines and salts or derivatives thereof. Oxycarboxylic acids are preferred among the carboxylic acids diketones are preferred among the ketones and basic and acidic amino acids are preferred among the amino acids. Furthermore the complexing agent is preferably at least one compound selected from butylamine ethylamine propylamine dibutylamine diethylamine dipropylamine tributylamine triethylamine tripropylamine imidazole citric acid or alkali metal salts thereof acetylacetone hypophosphorous acid or alkali metal salts thereof histidine alginine ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or alkali metal salts thereof ethanolamine and acetonitrile. The amount of these oxygen or nitrogen based complexing agents is preferably 0.01 200 parts by weight more preferably 0.1 200 parts by weight further preferably 0.5 150 parts by weight for 1000 parts by weight of the divalent copper oxide as mentioned above.

Furthermore in the present invention when a complexing agent in which at least one donor atom is sulfur is used in an amount of 0.01 2 parts by weight for 1000 parts by weight of the divalent copper oxide production of finer copper microparticles can be easily controlled. As complexing agents containing sulfur mention may be made of for example the above mercaptocarboxylic acids thioglycols sulfur containing amino acids aliphatic thiols alicyclic thiols aromatic thiols thioketones thioethers polythiols thiocarbonic acids sulfur containing heterocyclic compounds thiocyanates and isothiocyanates inorganic sulfur compounds thionic acids aminothiols thioamides thioureas thiazoles or salts or derivatives thereof. Among them mercaptocarboxylic acids thioglycols and sulfur containing amino acids are preferred because they are high in effect and mercaptopropionic acid mercaptoacetic acid mercaptoethanol and cysteine are more preferred. More preferred amount is 0.05 1 part by weight and further preferred is 0.05 part by weight or more and less than 0.5 part by weight.

The protective colloid acts as a dispersion stabilizer for the produced copper microparticles and those which are known as protective colloids can be used. Examples thereof comprise natural polymers and synthetic polymers. As natural polymers mention may be made of for example proteins such as gelatin gum arabic casein sodium caseinate and ammonium caseinate starch dextrin agar and sodium alginate. As synthetic polymers mention may be made of for example celluloses such as hydroxyethyl cellulose carboxymethyl cellulose methyl cellulose and ethyl cellulose vinyl compounds such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl pyrrolidone acrylic acid compounds such as sodium polyacrylate and ammonium polyacrylate and polyethylene glycol. These may be used each alone or in combination of two or more. Polymeric protective colloids have high dispersion stabilization effect and are preferred. When reaction is carried out in an aqueous liquid medium water soluble protective colloids are preferred and especially preferred are gelatin polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone and polyethylene glycol. When they are used in an amount of 1 100 parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of the divalent copper oxide the resulting copper microparticles are readily dispersed and stabilized and hence the above range is preferred and 2 50 parts by weight is more preferred.

As for the reducing agent it is preferred to use a reducing agent having strong reducing power so that monovalent copper oxide is not produced during the reduction reaction. Examples of the reducing agent are hydrazine based reducing agents e.g. hydrazine and hydrazine compounds such as hydrazine hydrochloride hydrazine sulfate and hydrazine hydrate sodium borohydride sodium sulfite sodium hydrogensulfite sodium thiosulfate sodium nitrite sodium hyponitrite phosphorous acid and salts thereof such as sodium phosphite and hypophosphorous acid and salts thereof such as sodium hypophosphite. These may be used each alone or in combination of two or more. Particularly hydrazine reducing agents are strong in reducing power and are preferred. The amount of the reducing agent can be optionally set as long as copper microparticles can be produced from the divalent copper oxide and is preferably in the range of 0.2 5 mols for 1 mol of copper contained in the divalent copper oxide. If the amount of the reducing agent is less than the above range the reaction hardly proceeds and copper microparticles are not sufficiently produced and if it is more than the above range the reaction proceeds to excess and desired copper microparticles can hardly be obtained. The amount of the reducing agent is more preferably in the range of 0.3 2 mols.

After producing metallic copper microparticles in the presence of a complexing agent and a protective colloid by the above mentioned process if necessary the microparticles are subjected to fractionation and washing and preferably a protective colloid scavenger is added to the liquid medium to flocculate the metallic copper microparticles followed by subjecting to fractionation. The protective colloid scavenger is a compound which decomposes or dissolves the protective colloid to inhibit the action of the protective colloid and the effect of the present invention can be obtained if it can remove the protective colloid even partially from the liquid medium even if it cannot completely remove the protective colloid. The protective colloid scavenger is optionally selected depending on the protective colloid used. Specifically there can be used proteases such as serine proteases e.g. trypsin and chymotrypsin thiol proteases e.g. papain acid proteases e.g. pepsin and metal proteases for protein protective colloids amylases such as amylase and maltase for starch protective colloids and cellulases such as cellulase and cellobiase for cellulose protective colloids. Organic solvents such as formamide glycerin and glycol acids and alkalis can be used for protective colloids such as vinyl compounds acrylic acid compounds or polyethylene glycol. The amount of the protective colloid scavenger may be such that the protective colloid can be removed to such an extent that the copper microparticles can be flocculated and fractionated and the amount varies depending on its kind. In the case of protease the amount is preferably 0.001 1000 parts by weight more preferably 0.01 200 parts by weight further preferably 0.01 100 parts by weight for 1000 parts by weight of the protein protective colloid. The temperature of the liquid medium when the protective colloid scavenger is added can be optionally set and it may be added in the state of keeping the reduction reaction temperature or preferably at a temperature in the range of 10 C. to the boiling point of the liquid medium used because removal of the protective colloid smoothly proceeds and more preferably at 40 95 C. When the protective colloid scavenger is added and thereafter this state is properly kept the protective colloid can be decomposed and the time for which the above state is kept is suitably about 10 minutes to 10 hours. After the protective colloid is removed and the metallic microparticles are flocculated fractionation is carried out by usual methods. The fractionation method is not particularly limited and there may be employed the methods such as gravity filtration pressure filtration vacuum filtration suction filtration centrifugal filtration and gravity settling. Industrially pressure filtration vacuum filtration and suction filtration are preferred and use of filters such as filter press and roll press is preferred because they are high in dehydrating ability and can fractionate the copper microparticles in a large amount.

As an embodiment of the above process when a flocculating agent is further added after the protective colloid scavenger is added the yield is further improved which is preferred. Known flocculating agents can be used and specifically there may be used anionic flocculating agents e.g. partial hydrolyzates of polyacrylamide acrylamide sodium acrylate copolymer and sodium alginate cationic flocculating agents e.g. polyacrylamide dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate dimethylaminoethyl acrylate polyamidine and chitosan amphoteric flocculating agents e.g. acrylamide dimethylaminoethyl acrylate acrylic acid copolymer and the like. The amount of the flocculating agents can be optionally set as required and is preferably 0.5 100 parts by weight more preferably 1 50 parts by weight for 1000 parts by weight of the copper microparticles.

Alternatively the similar yield improving effect can also be obtained by adjusting the pH of the liquid medium to 6 or lower by using an acid in place of the flocculating agent after the addition of the protective colloid scavenger. If the pH is lower than 3 the copper microparticles are corroded or dissolved and hence a range of 3 6 is a preferred pH range and the range of 4 6 is further preferred because the amount of the acid can be reduced.

If necessary after the metallic copper microparticles are subjected to solid liquid separation and washing solid matters of the resulting metallic copper microparticles may be dispersed for example in an aqueous liquid medium or an organic solvent type liquid medium such as alcohol preferably an aqueous liquid medium and this dispersion may be used. Alternatively the solid matters of the metallic copper microparticles may be dried by a usual method and furthermore after the drying they may be dispersed for example in an aqueous liquid medium or an organic solvent type liquid medium such as alcohol preferably an aqueous liquid medium and the dispersion may be used. Since the metallic copper microparticles are susceptible to oxidation the drying is carried out preferably in an inert gas atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon. After the drying they may be ground if necessary.

Furthermore the present invention relates to metallic copper microparticles which contain at least metallic copper and has metallic property and may contain impurities copper compounds and oxidation stabilizers on the surface or inside of the copper microparticles to such an extent as not interfering the use. The metallic copper microparticles of the present invention are fine and contain substantially no agglomerated particles and have regular shapes. Indications for these properties are that when an average particle diameter cumulative 50 diameter as measured by an electron microscope namely an average primary particle diameter is expressed by D and an average particle diameter cumulative 50 diameter as measured by a dynamic light scattering method namely an average secondary particle diameter is expressed by d the metallic copper microparticles have a D in the range of 0.005 2.0 m a d in the range of 0.005 2.0 m and a ratio d D in the range of 0.7 2. The degree of agglomeration is low since D and d are in the above ranges and fine and the ratio d D is in the above range and very close to 1. Therefore the metallic copper microparticles have excellent dispersibility in fluid composition and such metallic copper microparticles are obtained by the above mentioned process. The ratio d D is usually 1 or more but since the measuring methods of D and d are different d D may be smaller than 1 in some cases. The shape of the metallic copper microparticles of the present invention can be observed by an electron microscope and is regular with polyhedron structure.

The preferred ranges of the average primary particle diameter D the average secondary particle diameter d and the ratio d D of the metallic copper microparticles of the present invention are a range of D of 0.005 1.0 m a range of d of 0.005 1.0 m and a range of d D of 0.7 1.5 more preferred ranges are a range of D of 0.005 0.75 m a range of d of 0.005 0.75 m and a range of d D of 0.7 1.5 further preferred ranges are a range of D of 0.005 0.5 m a range of d of 0.005 0.5 m and a range of d D of 0.7 1.5 and further more preferred ranges are a range of D of 0.005 0.4 m a range of d of 0.005 0.4 m and a range of d D of 0.7 1.5. Moreover depending on the use the lower limit of the average primary particle diameter D and the average secondary particle diameter d is more preferably 0.01 m further preferably 0.02 m and most preferably 0.05 m. Such copper microparticles are obtained by using a complexing agent containing at least one atom selected from nitrogen and oxygen as a donor atom in the above mentioned process.

Furthermore copper microparticles obtained using the complexing agent containing at least sulfur as a donor atom in an amount of 0.01 2 parts by weight preferably 0.05 1 part by weight further preferably not less than 0.05 part by weight and less than 0.5 part by weight based on 1000 parts by weight of the copper oxide have an average primary particle diameter D of 0.005 0.5 m an average secondary particle diameter d of 0.005 0.5 m and a ratio d D of 0.7 1.5. More preferred mode of the copper microparticles is such that D is in the range of not less than 0.005 m and less than 0.1 m d is in the range of not less than 0.005 m and less than 0.1 m and d D is in the range of 0.7 1.5.

Moreover the present invention relates to a fluid composition such as ink paint or paste which contains at least the metallic copper microparticles and a dispersion medium. The content of the metallic copper microparticles may be at least about 1 by weight and is preferably a high content of not less than 5 by weight more preferably not less than 10 by weight and further preferably not less than 15 by weight. The dispersion medium used for dispersing the metallic copper microparticles is optionally selected according to the affinity for the copper microparticles used and there may be used for example water solvent hydrophilic organic solvents such as alcohols and ketones and hydrophobic organic solvents such as straight chain hydrocarbons cyclic hydrocarbons and aromatic hydrocarbons. There may be used one solvent selected from them two or more solvents having compatibility as a mixed dispersion medium or a mixture of water and a hydrophobic organic solvent using a hydrophilic organic solvent as a compatibilizing agent. Specific examples of the dispersion medium are methanol ethanol propyl alcohol isopropyl alcohol butanol isobutanol and terpineol as alcohols and cyclohexanone methylcyclohexanone 2 butanone methyl isobutyl ketone and acetone as ketones. Furthermore toluene mineral spirit and the like can be suitably used as the organic solvents. Preferred dispersion media used for ink and paint are water solvent or mixed dispersion media with hydrophilic organic solvent mainly composed of water. In this case water may be contained in an amount of usually not less than 50 by weight preferably not less than 80 by weight in the mixed dispersion media.

In the fluid composition of the present invention using water as a dispersion medium since water has high surface tension it is preferred to add an organic solvent having a relative dielectric constant of 35 or more preferably 35 200 and a boiling point of 100 C. or higher preferably 100 250 C. because surface defects such as wrinkles and shrinks hardly occur in the coating film upon heating and firing and uniform and high density coating film can be obtained.

The fluid composition of the present invention can also contain additives such as surface active agents dispersants thickeners plasticizers and mildew proofing agents in addition to the metallic copper microparticles and the dispersion medium.

For example there can be used known cationic surface active agents such as quaternary ammonium salts anionic surface active agents such as carboxylic salts sulfonic salts sulfuric ester salts and phosphoric ester salts and nonionic surface active agents such as ether type ether ester type ester type and nitrogen containing type and one or more of them can be used. The amount of the surface active agent added is optionally set depending on the paint composition and in general is preferably 0.01 0.5 part by weight for 1 part by weight of the metallic copper microparticles. Furthermore if necessary the fluid composition may contain organic hardening binders such as phenolic resin epoxy resin unsaturated polyester resin vinyl ester resin diallyl phthalate resin oligo ester acrylate resin xylene resin bismaleimide triazine resin furan resin urea resin polyurethane resin melamine resin silicone resin and cellulosic resin as far as they do not damage the effects of the present invention. The amount of the hardening binder can be optionally set depending on the site of use and in the case of forming electrodes or wiring patterns the hardening binder is not added or added in an amount of suitably about 0 0.5 by weight more suitably 0 0.1 by weight based on 1 part by weight of the metallic copper microparticles.

The fluid composition of the present invention can be prepared by mixing the metallic copper microparticles the dispersion medium and other additives by known method and there may be used for example agitation mixing wet grind mixing such as colloid mill and the like can be used. The resulting fluid composition can be used for various uses and for example the composition can be coated on a substrate by screen printing ink jet printing or the like followed by heating and firing to prepare circuits of printed wiring boards and other fine conductive materials.

Average primary particle diameter D of Samples A V and a i obtained in Examples 1 28 and Comparative Examples 1 4 was measured by electron microscope method and average secondary particle diameter d was measured by a dynamic light scattering particle size distribution measuring apparatus MICROTRACK UPA manufactured by Nikkiso Co.

The average secondary particle diameter d was measured using an aqueous slurry prepared by sufficiently dispersing the sample in water using an ultrasonic dispersing machine and adjusting the concentration so that the signal intensity of laser reached 0.6 0.8. The results are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that the copper microparticles obtained according to the present invention were fine in average particle diameter D namely primary particle diameter. Furthermore it can be seen that they were also fine in average particle diameter d namely secondary particle diameter and simultaneously they had a d D close to 1 and contained substantially no agglomerated particles.

In Example 14 the liquid medium in the course of reduction reaction after lapse of 25 minutes 35 minutes and 55 minutes from addition of the reducing agent was dispensed and evaporated to dryness. These are referred to Samples j l. X ray diffraction of Samples j l and cupric oxide N 120 used as a starting material was measured and the results were compared. The results are shown in . Peaks originating from cuprous oxide were not recognized in Samples j l and it can be seen that cupric oxide was reduced to metallic copper without production of cuprous oxide. The same evaluation was conducted on the samples of other examples to find that cuprous oxide was not produced during the reduction reaction. Furthermore the liquid medium containing the intermediate product obtained in Comparative Example 3 was filtered and dried and X ray diffraction of the dried product Sample m was measured. The results are shown in . It can be seen that the intermediate product was cuprous oxide.

Copper microparticles Samples K T and V obtained in Example 11 and Comparative Examples 1 and 3 having the formulation as shown in Table 4 were kneaded using a three roll kneader roll diameter 65 mm by passing three times roll clearance 30 m at the first passing and 1 m at the second and third passing to obtain the copper paste of the present invention and the comparative copper pastes.

Dispersibility of the copper pastes of Example 29 and Comparative Examples 4 and 5 Samples n p was measured by the method in accordance with JIS K5400 using a grind gauge. The results are shown in Table 5. Since the smaller measurement value indicates better dispersibility it can be seen that the copper microparticles of the present invention were superior in dispersibility when they were made into a copper paste.

Each of the copper pastes of Example 29 and Comparative Examples 4 and 5 Samples n p was coated on an aluminum plate using a 4 mil applicator and predried at a temperature of 80 C. for 2 hours followed by baking at 300 C. for 1 hour in a nitrogen atmosphere nitrogen flow rate 500 cc min to form a film and furthermore firing and reducing at 500 C. for 1 hour in a hydrogen atmosphere of 2 in concentration. The resulting film was air cooled and then the volume resistivity of the film was measured using LORESTA GP low resistivity meter manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation . The results are shown in Table 5. Since the lower volume resistivity indicates the higher conductivity it can be seen that the copper paste containing the copper microparticles of the present invention was high in conductivity.

The copper microparticles of the present invention are useful as electrode materials of electronic equipments and particularly a fluid composition such as copper paste paint or ink containing the copper microparticles is useful for inner electrodes of laminated ceramics capacitors circuits of printed wiring boards and other electrodes.
