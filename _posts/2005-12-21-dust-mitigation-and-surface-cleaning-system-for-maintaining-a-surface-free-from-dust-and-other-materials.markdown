This invention was made with U.S. Government support and the U.S. Government may have certain rights in the invention as provided for by the terms of contract No. W911SR 05 C 0015.

The present invention relates to systems and corresponding methods for mitigating dust and maintaining windows and other surfaces clean.

The monitoring of air quality and in particular toxic and hazardous compositions within certain ambient e.g. outdoor environments is important in certain applications such as in combat or other military operations or at large industrial complexes e.g. chemical production facilities . Spectroscopy e.g. infrared or Raman spectroscopy is a highly useful technique in monitoring air quality by identifying components and determining their compositions within the air at one or more designated locations.

For example certain spectroscopic equipment including one or more optical sensors e.g. lasers and or detectors can be provided within a motorized vehicle to facilitate monitoring of the air quality at selected areas of the surrounding environment as the vehicle traverses a field or other terrain. The equipment is maintained within a secured housing within the vehicle to prevent dust and other materials from coming into contact with and potentially damaging the equipment. In addition a portal or window is provided at a suitable location with respect to the equipment housing and vehicle to facilitate transmission and or detection of an optical signal between the sensor within the housing and the ground or some other surface to be monitored outside the vehicle.

When using such equipment it is important to maintain the sensor window as clean as possible. However this can become very difficult in certain environments such as environments that can become dust laden e.g. deserts and or muddy e.g. swamps .

In light of the above and for other reasons that become apparent when the invention is described an object of the present invention is to provide a system that maintains a window clean and free from dust mud or other materials to which the window may be exposed.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for maintaining a sensor window of an air quality monitoring system in an outdoor environment free from dust or other materials.

The aforesaid objects are achieved individually and in combination and it is not intended that the present invention be construed as requiring two or more of the objects to be combined unless expressly required by the claims attached hereto.

In accordance with the present invention a dust mitigation and cleaning system for cleaning a surface includes a system housing secured around at least a portion of a section including the surface to be cleaned. The system housing includes a hollow member extending within the system housing toward and in general alignment with the surface to be cleaned where an outlet of the system housing is defined by the hollow member. A duct section is secured to a portion of the system housing and includes an inlet to receive a gaseous fluid e.g. air from a selected environment e.g. an ambient environment in which the system is disposed and an outlet in communication with the system housing. The system further includes a differential pressure generator e.g. a fan a pump or compressor etc. disposed within the duct section where operation of the pressure generator generates a pressure differential between an interior portion of the system housing and the ambient environment such that gaseous fluid drawn into the system housing via the duct section is removed from the interior portion of the system housing via the outlet defined by the hollow member.

Preferably the system is secured or mounted to a motorized vehicle the system housing is configured to be secured around at least a portion of a housing structure that contains optical sensor equipment and the surface to be cleaned comprises a sensor window defining a wall portion of the housing structure.

The above and still further objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of a specific embodiment thereof particularly when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference numerals in the various figures are utilized to designate like components.

In accordance with the present invention a dust mitigation and surface cleaning system is configured to provide a supply of forced air or other fluid e.g. nitrogen against a surface such as a window to remove and or minimize contact of dust mud and other materials with respect to the surface. Alternatively or in combination with the forced fluid supply the system can include another fluid supply source and one or more spray nozzles to direct a flow of fluid toward the surface in any one or more selected spray patterns to remove materials from the surface.

The dust mitigation and surface cleaning system is described herein for use with an outside air quality monitoring and detection system that is mounted within a motorized vehicle where the system maintains a sensor window substantially clean in order to facilitate suitable detection and concentration measurements of certain components within the ambient air environment surrounding the vehicle. However it is noted that the dust mitigation and surface cleaning system can be implemented for use in maintaining a clean surface for indoor or outdoor applications particularly where it is desirable to maintain the surface substantially free from dust and or other materials.

Referring to a dust mitigation and surface cleaning system is implemented for use in a motorized vehicle e.g. an all terrain vehicle such as a High Mobility Multipurpose Vehicle or Hum Vee . Vehicle includes a compartment that serves as a shelter for the air quality monitoring and detection system as well as operators of the system. The air quality monitoring and detection system includes sensor equipment that is used to monitor air quality and identify and determine the composition of certain components in the air. In an exemplary embodiment the sensor equipment includes a laser to transmit a laser signal toward and a detector to measure a reflected signal from a ground surface in order to facilitate spectroscopic measurements of the surrounding environment using Raman scattering or some other suitable technique. An optical signal is directed from the sensor equipment within compartment and along an optical path that is defined through the vehicle as described below and toward the ground surface beneath the vehicle. The sensor equipment can be designed to conduct an air quality measurement by scanning with the optical signal at any suitable rate e.g. about 25 or more scans per second .

As can be seen from dust mitigation and surface cleaning system is mounted along one side of the vehicle and at a location proximate and just to the front of one of the rear tires. The system includes a duct section that extends along an exterior side wall of the vehicle and also through a vehicle side wall portion to connect with a protective housing referred to as a dog house of system . The dog house as well as other components of the dust mitigation and surface cleaning system can be constructed of any suitable materials such as metals e.g. steel and or aluminum and or plastics e.g. polyolefins such as polyethylene .

As can best be seen from dog house connects to an underside and is supported by a lower surface portion of the vehicle frame or chassis that also defines a lower support surface or floor of vehicle compartment . The dog house is preferably secured to lower surface portion at a location where the vehicle chassis body is elevated with respect to other lower surface portions e.g. at or near the wheel well of the vehicle chassis . This allows the dog house to be elevated as far as possible from the ground surface upon which the vehicle traverses.

A lower end of duct section includes an outlet that extends through a cut out section of the vehicle side wall and within a side wall portion of dog house . An upper end of the duct section includes openings that serve as inlets to the duct section for drawing air into the duct section and into the dog house as described below. A fan is mounted within the duct section to draw the air from the inlet openings into the dog house and a filter is also mounted within the duct section at a suitable location upstream from the fan to filter particulate materials of selected sizes e.g. dust particles sand etc. from the incoming air prior to delivery to the dog house. The filter can be of any suitable type mesh or screen size and or configuration to meet the specifications of a particular application e.g. applications in which particulate material of a specified diameter or size must be removed from the incoming air prior to delivery of the air to the dog house .

The fan can be of any suitable size and or type e.g. fixed or variable speed to control the flow of air at a selected flow rate and velocity for a particular application. For example a suitable fan can be selected to draw air into the duct section at a velocity of about 10 mph about 4.47 meters second . The fan can be actuated via a power switch disposed at any suitable location on system and or within vehicle such as in the cabin or driving compartment of the vehicle or alternatively within compartment to allow the driver or operator to selectively control operation of the fan during operation of the sensor equipment. In addition the fan can be powered by any suitable power supply source e.g. the vehicle main battery a specified battery for the system or other supply sources .

While a fan is shown in system it is noted that any other suitable pressure differential device can be provided to draw air or any other fluid into the dog house. For example a pump or compressor could be provide to generate a desired pressure differential that facilitates the flow of air into and through the dog house.

An equipment housing is secured within vehicle compartment and extends through a cut out section or opening in lower surface portion of the vehicle such that a portion of the equipment housing extends within dog house at a selected distance e.g. about 4 5 inches or about 10 13 centimeters from a lower wall portion of the dog house. A gap within dog house is defined as the space between the dog house and the portion of the equipment housing extending within the dog house. Outlet of duct section extends within dog house so as to be generally aligned near or below a lower or bottom surface of equipment housing such that air flowing from the duct section enters the gap in the dog house. In addition the duct section outlet is oriented to generally direct air toward the lower or bottom surface of the dog house.

The equipment housing surrounds and protects the sensor equipment e.g. laser detector and related equipment disposed within the housing. In addition a lower wall portion of equipment housing includes a cut out section in which a transparent sensor window is provided. The sensor window can be constructed of glass plexi glass or any other suitable transparent and sufficiently rigid material that facilitates transmission of an optical signal through the window. In addition the sensor window can be of any suitable dimensions and geometric configurations e.g. square round oval etc. . For example the sensor window can have a circular configuration as depicted in with a diameter of about 6 inches about 15 centimeters . However depending upon a particular application the sensor window can be of greater or smaller dimensions. The sensor window is tightly sealed with respect to the cut out section of the equipment housing to prevent dust air or any other material from entering the equipment housing at the sensor window during system operation.

The lower wall portion of dog house includes a generally cylindrical hollow and tubular member that extends upward toward equipment housing in alignment with sensor window . The tubular member further extends through the lower wall of the dog house to provide an opening from the dog house to the surrounding environment. Tubular member extends a selected distance toward equipment housing to leave a small gap between the end of member and sensor window . For example the system can be designed such that the distance between the tubular member and the window surface is no greater than about 2 inches about 5 centimeters . The tubular member has dimensions that generally correspond with the dimensions of the sensor window. In an exemplary embodiment where the sensor window has a diameter of about 6 inches about 15 centimeters the inside diameter of the tubular member preferably has about the same dimension. While the tubular member depicted in is cylindrical the tubular member can have any cross sectional geometric configuration e.g. rectangular oval etc. . Thus the dog house is open to the surrounding environment below the vehicle and the sensor window and the tubular member are suitably aligned with each other to define a linear optical path for an optical signal to be transmitted e.g. a laser beam from a laser from within housing toward a ground surface that supports and is traversed by the vehicle during a scanning operation.

In operation vehicle is driven along a selected terrain while the sensor equipment within equipment housing selectively scans the terrain by transmitting an optical signal e.g. a laser beam from a laser along the optical path as defined by sensor window and the opening provided by tubular member of dog house toward the ground surface beneath the vehicle. The signal reflected by the ground surface is also received by the sensor equipment via the optical path. The reflected signal is then analyzed to determine the presence and concentration of substances within the air and or at the ground surface.

Depending upon a particular environment in which the vehicle is traveling it is possible for dust mud and or other materials from the surrounding environment to enter through tubular member and into gap within the dog house and to potentially collect or accumulate on sensor window . System effectively minimizes or removes such materials from gap as well as any materials that may collect on the sensor window by actuation of fan to draw air into duct section via inlet openings and into the gap of dog house . Air that is drawn into the duct section is processed by filter to remove particulate material e.g. dust from the air stream prior to entering the dog house. The air stream is directed by duct section outlet toward the lower or bottom surface of the dog house where it is then circulated throughout gap and toward sensor window .

The fan basically generates a pressure differential between the dog house and the ambient environment surrounding the dog house where air flows into the dog house gap and ultimately passes out through tubular member and back into the ambient environment which is at a lower pressure than the pressure within gap . The air flowing within gap entrains dust and or any other materials that may have entered into the dog house gap such that these materials flow with the air through tubular member and out of the dog house back to the ambient environment. Since the entrance to the tubular member is proximate sensor window the swirling air currents moving toward the tubular member tend to contact and remove any material that may have collected on the sensor window prior to leaving the dog house through tubular member . The swirling air currents also minimize or prevent contact between the sensor window and dust and or any other materials that may be within the dog house by continuously wiping the sensor window. The continuous operation of the fan and the resultant forced air flow from the dog house further substantially limits or prevents any other dust and or other foreign particles or materials in the ambient environment from entering the dog house.

Duct section fan can be used continuously during operation of the sensor equipment so as to minimize or prevent any dust or other materials from even entering into dog house . Alternatively fan can be selectively actuated by an operator e.g. via a control switch as described above during operation of the sensor equipment and during periods when the potential for entry of foreign materials within the dog house increases e.g. during sand or dust storms in desert like environments during movement of the vehicle along muddy terrain etc. .

An alternative embodiment of a dust mitigation and surface cleaning system is depicted in . Referring to system is similar in design as the system described above and depicted in where system is mounted along vehicle at a similar location i.e. proximate and to the front of a rear tire of the vehicle . The system includes a dog house that connects with an underside and is supported by lower surface portion of the vehicle chassis or body that also defines a lower support surface or floor of vehicle compartment . Equipment housing which contains sensor equipment of the types described above is mounted within the vehicle compartment and extends through a cut out section of lower surface portion and into dog house . As in the previous embodiment a gap is defined as the space between the dog house and the portion of the equipment housing extending within the dog house and a tubular member extends from a cut out section of a lower or bottom wall surface of the dog house and is aligned and proximate with a sensor window formed in a lower or bottom surface of equipment housing so as to define an optical path for transmission of an optical signal between the sensor equipment and the ground that is traversed by the vehicle.

Referring to system further includes a duct section connecting with a side wall of the dog house and extending through an exterior side wall of vehicle . In particular a duct section is connected to a panel with a gasket disposed between the duct section and panel to provide an airtight seal and the panel secures to a cut out section of a side wall portion of the vehicle body. A generally cylindrical filter housing is secured at the inlet of the duct section. The filter housing includes a grill and contains a suitable filter to remove particulate material e.g. dust from the air being drawn within the duct section. Any suitable air filter e.g. a conventional auto air filter can be provided depending upon a particular application and the sizes and types of particulate material that need to be filtered. The location of filter housing in system facilitates easy removal and replacement of the filter.

A fan is secured within a portion of duct section and the fan can optionally include a power switch that can be mounted at any suitable location e.g. in the vehicle cabin where the driver is seated or in compartment so as to be accessibly by an operator of the sensor equipment . The fan can be powered by any suitable power supply source e.g. the vehicle main battery or a specified battery for the system . An outlet of the duct section is provided at a suitable location within gap of the dog house. A removable access panel is also secured to main panel .

The dust mitigation and surface cleaning system operates in a substantially similar manner as the previous embodiment described above and depicted in . In particular air that is drawn in through duct section is initially filtered as the air passes through filter housing . The air stream enters dog house gap swirls around within the gap and then passes through tubular member . The airflow path is brought in close proximity and or contact with sensor window due to the close spacing between the tubular member and the sensor window and any dust and or other material within the dog house gap or on the sensor window becomes entrained with the air and is removed through the tubular member.

While the systems described above are effective in minimizing or even preventing the presence of dust and or other materials on the sensor window and also within the gap defined within the dog house the systems can be further enhanced by providing a fluid spray device that directs fluid toward the sensor window to remove materials e.g. mud that may stick to the window. Referring to a portion of a dog house for a dust mitigation and surface cleaning system and also a portion of equipment housing are depicted where it is understood that the dog house and equipment housing are substantially similar in configuration and design as any of the previous embodiments. The equipment housing includes a sensor window and the dog house includes a tubular member that extends from a lower or bottom wall of the dog house to be closely spaced and aligned with the sensor window. As in the previous embodiments the dust mitigation and surface cleaning system provides a flow of air at a suitable flow rate to remove or prevent the presence of dust and or other materials both on the sensor window and within the dog house gap.

In addition two spray nozzles and are secured to tubular member via an adjustable bracket . In particular the nozzles are secured at one end of the bracket and the bracket includes an elongated groove in which fasteners e.g. threaded screws are inserted to secure the bracket to the tubular member. The position of bracket can be adjusted by fasteners with respect to tubular member so as to secure spray nozzles and at a variety of different distances with respect to sensor window . For example the spray nozzles can be provided nearly flush with the upper surface of the tubular member so as to be within about 2 inches about 5 centimeters from the surface of the sensor window. The bracket can also be repositioned such that the spray nozzles are closer e.g. less than 2 inches to the sensor window. A fluid line is connected with each spray nozzle and the fluid lines combine to form a single or main fluid line that extends to a reservoir e.g. a polyethylene tank . The reservoir can have be of any suitable size e.g. a 0.5 gallon or 2 liter capacity tank to store cleaning fluid and can further be mounted at any suitable location e.g. within the dog house within the vehicle compartment or at any other suitable location of the vehicle . The reservoir contains a suitable cleaning fluid e.g. water an alcohol a suitable windshield cleaning fluid and or combinations thereof that is dispersed to the spray nozzles at a selected pressure and flow rate via fluid lines . A pump is disposed along main fluid line between the reservoir and the nozzles. The pump can be of any suitable type and configuration e.g. a 24 Volt pump to deliver the fluid at the desired pressure within the fluid lines. A power switch for the pump can be provided at any suitable location e.g. in the vehicle cabin where near the vehicle driver within compartment near the sensor equipment etc. to facilitate selective spraying of fluid on the sensor window depending upon operating conditions and the pump can further be connected with any suitable power supply source e.g. the main battery of the vehicle or any other battery .

Spray nozzles and are suitably aligned with respect to sensor window to direct a spray of fluid from each nozzle toward the sensor window at different spray angles. Referring to the spray nozzles are preferably stainless steel nozzles that deliver a flat spray at a selected coverage angle e.g. about 60 . The spray nozzles are further designed and oriented in the system such that nozzle delivers a fluid spray pattern toward sensor window that includes and concentrates upon a central portion of the window including the portion of the sensor window that is within the optical signal path e.g. a laser signal path as depicted in . Nozzle delivers a fluid spray pattern that also includes the central portion but also washes across the sensor window and is slightly offset from the spray pattern generated by nozzle . While two spray nozzles are depicted in it is noted that any suitable number of spray nozzles e.g. one or more can be provided to spray a fluid in any suitable pattern or patterns and at coverage spray angles of any suitable sizes toward the sensor window.

In operation pump can be selectively actuated e.g. by manipulation of the power switch by a system operator to spray liquid from the nozzles toward sensor window e.g. when mud or other material becomes stuck on the window . The liquid spray effectively cleans the sensor window and removes any material that may not easily be removed from the airflow within the dog house gap. Upon removal of material from the sensor window the liquid spray and material become entrained in the air flowing within the dog house gap and are removed from the dog house through tubular member .

As an alternative or in combination with the fluid spray device a gaseous spray device e.g an air knife can be provided in close proximity to the sensor window to provide a jet of pressurized air or other gaseous fluid toward the sensor window to effect removal of material that may contact and stick to the window during operation of the sensor equipment.

The systems described above can be further modified such that the duct section withdraws air or other gaseous fluids from another source rather than the ambient environment surrounding the vehicle. For example the duct section can be configured to withdraw air from a work space within any compartment or housing of the vehicle. Alternatively a gaseous fluid such as nitrogen could be withdrawn from a storage tank or compartment and utilized to clean the sensor window and generate the desired pressure differential between the dog house and the surrounding ambient environment.

Thus the dust mitigation and surface cleaning system of the invention can utilize a gaseous fluid flow e.g. air nitrogen etc. as described above or a gaseous fluid flow in combination with liquid spray nozzles and or gas jets to dislodge and remove any material that may become adhered to a surface as well as reduce or eliminate the presence of dust and or other materials within a defined space that is adjacent or proximate the surface.

The dust mitigation and surface cleaning system of the invention is highly effective in systems employing optical sensor equipment in outdoor environments e.g. in vehicles or any other indoor or outdoor environments in which it is desirable or essential to maintain a surface e.g. a lens or a window substantially clean and free of dust and other materials during operation of the equipment.

It will be appreciated that the embodiments described above and illustrated in the drawings represent only a few of the many ways of implementing a dust mitigation and surface cleaning system in accordance with the present invention.

For example the duct section can have any suitable size shape and configuration and can further include any suitable number and types of filters and pressure generator devices e.g. pumps compressors and or fans to facilitate the filtering of air and delivery of the filtered air at any suitable pressure and flow rate into the dog house. The duct section can draw a gaseous fluid from an ambient environment surrounding the system and or from some housing or internal environment within the system.

The dog house can have any suitable dimensions and configurations to at least partially surround a surface to be cleaned and to define a gap that receives air from the duct section for cleaning the surface. The tubular member of the dog house can have any suitable dimensions and configuration and can be disposed at any selected distance from the surface to be cleaned.

Any suitable number of nozzles and or spray jets for spraying a liquid and or gas toward the surface can be provided to supplement the cleaning by the air flow within the gap.

The dust mitigation and surface cleaning system is not limited to use in motorized vehicles. For example the system can be implemented for use in maintaining a lens or sensor window clean for a fixed and possible remote optical equipment monitoring station e.g. in a desert environment . Further the system of the present invention is not limited to use with optical devices and or outdoor applications. Rather the system can be utilized with any device in which it is desired to maintain a surface of the device clean during operation of the device.

Having described preferred embodiments of a dust mitigation and surface cleaning system variations and changes will be suggested to those skilled in the art in view of the teachings set forth herein. It is therefore to be understood that all such variations modifications and changes are believed to fall within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.
