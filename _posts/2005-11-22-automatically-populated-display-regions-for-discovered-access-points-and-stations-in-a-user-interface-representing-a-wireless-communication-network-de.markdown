title: Automatically populated display regions for discovered access points and stations in a user interface representing a wireless communication network deployed in a physical environment
abstract: A system for providing automatically populated display regions showing discovered access points and stations in a user interface representing a wireless communication network deployed in a physical environment. A generated user interface includes a first display region in which access point representations are displayed as corresponding access points are automatically discovered within the wireless network, and a second display region in which station representations are displayed as corresponding stations are automatically discovered within the wireless network. The first and second display regions are provided external to another display region, referred to as the “physical space” display region, in which is shown a representation of the physical space in which the wireless network is deployed. As the access point and station representations appear in the first display region and second display region, the user can manipulate them, for example by drag and drop operations using a computer mouse, in order to place them appropriately in the physical space display region. In response, the disclosed system superimposes the access point and station representations over the physical space representation. The access point and station representations can subsequently be similarly repositioned by the user within the physical space representation.

The present application is a Continuation application under 35 U.S.C. 120 of commonly owned prior application Ser. No. 10 855 669 filed May 27 2004 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 043 277 in the name of Roger Pfister.

The disclosed system relates generally to user interface representations of wireless communication systems and more specifically to a system and method for providing automatically populated display regions for discovered access points and stations in a user interface representing a wireless communication network deployed in a physical environment.

Wireless communication networks are becoming increasingly common for interconnecting many types of electronic devices. Computer systems of all sizes personal digital assistants input output devices entertainment system components and other types of home appliances are all examples of client station devices that are candidates for interconnection using a wireless communication network. Various specific wireless communication protocols have been developed. Examples of existing wireless communication protocols may be found in the family of standards for wireless Local Area Networks LANs known as IEEE 802.11 including the 802.11a 802.11b and 802.11g wireless communication standards.

Generally wireless networks include some number of access devices referred to herein as access points that provide network access to some number of wireless client devices referred to herein as stations . For example an access point in a wireless network may be connected to a wired communication network and client stations using the wireless network are provided wireless access to the wired network through the access point.

Existing network management systems have significant shortcomings in how they visually represent access points and stations in a wireless network. Access points and stations may be shown as logical devices in a logical network map without representation of the wireless network s physical environment. Graphical representations of access points and stations may be similar or identical making it difficult for the user to quickly distinguish between these device types. Users accordingly find it difficult to distinguish between access points and stations within a wireless network. Similarly when a network device is discovered within the network the visual representation for that device may be initially displayed directly within a relatively complex logical network map making it difficult for the user to visually locate the new device in the display. Moreover after a device has been automatically discovered the user cannot conveniently place the representation of that device within a representation of the wireless network s physical environment using existing systems.

Accordingly it would be desirable to have a new system for representing access points and stations in a user interface showing a deployed wireless network. The new system should allow a user to conveniently identify access points and stations as they are automatically discovered and to place representations of automatically discovered access points and stations at locations within a representation of the physical environment in which the wireless network is deployed.

To address the above described and other shortcomings of existing systems a system and method are disclosed for providing automatically populated display regions showing representations of discovered access points and stations in a user interface representing a wireless communication network deployed in a physical environment. In the disclosed system a user interface is generated including a first display region in which access point representations are displayed as corresponding access points are automatically discovered within the wireless network and a second display region in which station representations are displayed as corresponding stations are automatically discovered within the wireless network. The first and second display regions are provided external to another display region referred to as the physical space display region in which is shown a representation of the physical space in which the wireless network is deployed. As the access point and station representations appear in the first display region and second display region the user can manipulate them for example by drag and drop operations using a computer mouse to place them appropriately in the physical space display region. In response the disclosed system superimposes the access point and station representations over the physical space representation. The access point and station representations can subsequently be repositioned by the user within the physical space representation.

Thus there is disclosed a system for representing discovered access points and stations in a user interface showing a deployed wireless network physical environment. The disclosed system allows a user to conveniently identify access points and stations as they are automatically discovered and to conveniently place the access point and station representations at locations within a representation of a physical environment.

As shown in an illustrative embodiment of the disclosed system includes a wireless communication network management software program and a separate drawing software program executing on a management station . The management station may for example consist of any specific type of computer system including one or more processors operable to execute program code stored in a computer program memory or other type of computer program storage device and having a number of input output devices and interfaces. The management station is communicably coupled to a wired network which in turn is coupled to a number of wireless access point devices shown for purposes of illustration as access points AP A AP B and AP C. The access point devices provide wireless access to the wired network to client station devices . The client station devices are shown for purposes of illustration as client stations CS A CS B CS C CS D and CS E. The access point devices and the client station devices are shown within a wireless communication network . The wireless communication network is accessible to and managed by the wireless communication network management program . The management station and each of the access point devices and client station devices shown in include hardware firmware and or software implemented functionality enabling them to communicate using one or more networking protocols to exchange information such as messages or packets.

During operation of the embodiment shown in the wireless communication network management program uses graphical user interface software GUI SW to provide a user interface output . The output includes a graphical representation of the radio frequency domain characteristics of one or more devices in the wireless communication network in combination with a graphical representation of the physical space in which the wireless communication network is deployed. In order to generate the output the wireless communication network management program communicates with the drawing program through an application programming interface API . For example display objects commands and or other data may be communicated between the wireless communication network management program and the drawing program . An electronic computer readable representation of the physical space such as a data file or other type of electronic document is stored by or within the drawing program . In an illustrative embodiment the drawing program consists of a copy of the Visio drawing program provided by the Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash.

At step the disclosed system operates to discover the access point and client station devices in the wireless communication network being managed. For example the wireless communication network may be associated with a predetermined subnet mask and that subnet mask may be used to discover devices on the wireless network that match the subnet mask. Such wireless network device discovery may be performed using techniques such as the PING Packet Internet Groper utility which check for all responding device IP Internet Protocol addresses corresponding to the predetermined subnet mask. In addition the Address Resolution Protocol ARP may for example then be used for translating IP addresses into the 6 byte Ethernet addresses of the discovered devices.

After the disclosed system has discovered a device on the wireless communication network a request message such as an SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol request message is sent to that device to determine whether the device is manageable by the wireless communication network management program of . Devices that return a positive response are sent further request messages to determine characteristics and settings of the devices. Such characteristics and settings may be obtained for example through values stored in the Management Information Base MIB of the devices and include indications of characteristics and settings such as transmit power settings and lists of associated client stations for access points.

At step the disclosed system operates to combine representations of the radio frequency domain characteristics of the wireless network devices with the physical space representation. As a result the radio frequency domain characteristics of the wireless network devices may be conveniently indicated to the user within the context of and at the same scale as the physical space representation. For example the disclosed system may operate by creating one or more wireless device radio frequency domain representations in one or more graphical layers defined using the drawing program that may be superimposed over the physical space representation in a user interface display.

The wireless communication network management program subsequently operates to periodically send further request messages to the access point devices discovered in step in order to monitor their radio frequency domain characteristics and settings such as current transmit power settings and associated client station lists. Any changes detected using these requests may then be used to modify radio frequency domain representations of the wireless network devices that are layered over the physical space representation in the user interface.

As shown in access point representation has an associated power range ring . The multi band access point representation represents a single corresponding access point device having multiple radio frequency band capabilities and includes conjoined access point representations and each having the same visual appearance as representations of single radio frequency band capable access point devices. For example the access point representation may represent the IEEE 802.11a radio frequency band circuitry within the multi band access point device corresponding to the graphical representation and the access point representation may represent the IEEE 802.11g radio frequency band circuitry within the multi band access point device corresponding to the graphical representation .

The conjoined access point representations and each have respective associated power range rings and . The areas within the power range rings and represent radio coverage ranges of the access point devices corresponding to the access point representations at their centers. The greater the diameter of a power range ring the larger the area of the radio coverage range it represents.

The thickness of each of the power range rings and represents the potential bandwidth that can be provided by the associated access point devices to client stations located within them. A thicker power range ring indicates a relatively larger amount of available bandwidth for client stations located within the area defined by the ring while a thinner power range ring indicates a relatively lower amount of available bandwidth for client stations located within the area defined by the ring. The appearances of the access point representations and associated power range rings are further indicative of the radio frequency channels on which the corresponding access point devices are currently operating. For example the access point representation may be displayed in a first predetermined color associated with a corresponding radio frequency channel indicating that the corresponding access point device is operating within that radio frequency channel.

Similarly since the multi band access point representation may correspond to a dual mode access point device thus including two independent sets of radio circuitry each of which can independently operate using a separate radio frequency band. Accordingly each of the conjoined access point representations and and their associated power range rings may be represented to visually indicate the respective colors associated respectively with two different radio frequency channels that currently being used by the corresponding access point.

Each access point representation may further include textual information. For example the access point representation includes text indicating the specific channel 153 that the corresponding access point device is currently operating on text indicating the wireless LAN protocol used a for 802.11a by the corresponding access point device and the last three characters of the MAC Media Access Control address 300 of the corresponding access point.

The specific appearance such as diameter width color and textual information for each access point representation and associated power range ring may be determined in part response to configuration and setting information determined from the corresponding devices for example by way of SNMP requests for MIB values stored in the devices. Such configuration information may include the type of wireless communication protocol supported and or enabled in the device such as one of the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b or 802.11g protocols. The configuration and setting information determined from the devices may also include a current transmit power setting for the device current channel or other information that may be used to determine the appearance of the access point representations and power range rings. User provided information may also or alternatively be used to determine in part or completely how the access point representations and power range rings are represented as described below with reference to .

The association lines provided between the client station and access point representations of are formatted to visually indicate the amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding access point and client station devices as well as the currently selected radio frequency channel being used to communicate between the devices. For example the width of an association line may be used to indicate the amount of available bandwidth between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations connected by the association line. In such an embodiment a relatively thick association line may be used to represent a relatively large amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding devices while a relatively thin association line may be used to represent a relatively small amount of available bandwidth between the corresponding devices. Similarly the format of the association lines in may be used to visually indicate a current radio frequency channel being used to communicate between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations the connect. For example the color of the association lines may indicate which radio frequency channel is currently being used to communicate between the devices corresponding to the graphical device representations they connect. Other association line format characteristics may alternatively be used to visually distinguish between higher and lower amounts of available bandwidth between corresponding devices and or between radio frequency channels currently being used to communicate between the corresponding devices.

At step the disclosed system operates to reposition the client station representations from the client station display region to the physical space display region. The repositioning performed at step may for example be performed responsive to a user clicking and dragging the client station representations from the client station display region into the physical space display region. Alternatively the repositioning at step may be automatically performed by the disclosed system based on a number of auto positioning parameters such as distance from associated access point representation. The association lines generated at step are maintained between the representations of associated devices in the repositioning provided at step .

2 Known Access Points other access point devices that can be heard by the access point device for example on the selected channel shown in and or some other channel.

In the example of the list box shows characteristics of a number of listed associated client stations. The columns shown in the list box are shown for example including the following information for each client station associated with the access point 

Channel The channel that the associated client station is currently using for transmits and receives 

WLAN Mode an indication of the wireless protocol in user for example a indicates that the 802.11a is in use by the associated client station and

Path Lost The amount dB of radio signal lost between the associated client station and the access point.

The association lines and between the access point and client station representations indicate amounts of available bandwidth between the corresponding associated wireless devices. For example the thickness of the association line indicates by its relative thickness the available bandwidth between the access point device corresponding to the access point representation and the client station device corresponding to the client station representation . The association line similarly indicates the available bandwidth between the access point device corresponding to the access point representation and the client station device corresponding the client station representation . Also the thickness of the association line indicates the available bandwidth between the access point device corresponding to the access point representation and the client station device corresponding to the client station representation . Accordingly as visually indicated by the relative thickness of the association line versus the relative thinness of the association lines and the client stations corresponding to the client station representation has a relatively larger amount of bandwidth available for communication with the access point device corresponding to the access point representation than the client station devices corresponding to the client station representations and have with the access point device corresponding to the access point representation . The colors of the access point representations power range rings and client station representations may be used to indicate the current radio frequency channels being used to communicate between the corresponding wireless devices.

The client station representation in indicates for example by way of a number of padlock graphics on it that the user has indicated that it should be excluded from auto positioning. Accordingly if an auto positioning function is invoked by the user the client station representation will not be moved from its current position in the display.

When a user selects the icon display tab shown in an icon interface display window is generated as shown in . The icon interface display window enables a user to indicate various visual aspects of the user interface display with regard to the device representations and association lines. The address display buttons enable the user to indicate whether some portion of the MAC or IP address of a device should be shown in a text portion of its graphical representation. The automatic client station placement button enables a user to indicate that representations of client stations should be automatically placed in physical proximity to the representations of the access point devices with which they are associated. The channel representation buttons enable a user to indicate how radio frequency channels currently in use should be represented in the device representations power range rings and association lines. For example different radio channels may be distinctly represented by respective ones of a set of CRT colors respective ones of a set of LCD colors or by corresponding line formats in black and white patterns. The association line thickness check box enables a user to indicate whether the thickness of association lines should be used to represent the relative amount of available bandwidth between associated devices. The association line thickness value field enables a user to indicate an association line thickness to be used if the association line thickness is not to be used to represent available bandwidth between associated devices. The power range ring thickness check box enables a user to indicate whether the thickness of displayed power range rings is to be used to indicate the amount of bandwidth available to client station devices within them. Similarly the power range ring thickness value field enables a user to indicate a power range ring thickness to be used if the power range ring thickness is not to be used to represent available bandwidth within the power range rings.

The power Halo check box enables a user to indicate an additional visual characteristic such as a shaded area referred to as a halo should be used with access point representations. For example the disclosed system may be embodied to include a colored shading over a circular area around an access point representation whenever the corresponding access point device is operable. Such a shading may resemble a colored cloud of the same color as used to represent the current radio frequency channel that the device is currently operating on. If the halo visual characteristic is enabled the user may further indicate the diameter of the shaded area to be used in the field .

The field enables a user to indicate a distance at which client station representations are to be placed when they are automatically placed near the representations of access point devices with which the corresponding client station devices are associated. The check box enables a user to indicate whether association lines are to be presented between the representations of associated devices and the check box enables the user to indicate whether power range rings are to be provided around representations of client stations.

The selected radio button from the column determines the diameter and thickness of the power range rings. A relatively small selected transmit power value in column results in relatively smaller diameter power range rings while a relatively large selected transmit power value in column results in relatively larger diameter power range rings. This reflects the fact that a higher transmit power enables the radio signals from the wireless devices associated with the power range rings to carry greater amounts of data over greater distances. Accordingly the disclosed system determines a diameter for each power range ring that corresponds to the distance in the physical space representation based on scale information provided by the user that would reflect the throughputs shown for the corresponding transmit power in the selected row. For example if the radio button for 64 dBm were selected and a device is being represented that uses IEEE 802.11b technology the disclosed system generates power range rings having a diameter equal to the distance in the scale of the physical space representation that could be traversed using a transmit power of 64 DBm and providing a maximum throughput of 11 megabits per second using the IEEE 802.11b protocol. If the device being represented is an IEEE 802.11a or 802.11g device the generated ring would have a diameter equal to the distance in the scale of the physical space representation that could be traversed using a transmit power of 64 DBm and providing a maximum throughput of 54 megabits per second using the IEEE 802.11a or 802.11g protocols.

Similarly the thickness of each power range ring decreases as the power range ring diameter increases reflecting a smaller amount of available bandwidth within the area of the physical space representation within the power range ring. Accordingly the values in columns and increase as the amount of transmit power in column increases. For example if the radio button in column corresponding to 64 dBm is selected the generated power range rings would have a relatively smaller thickness indicative of 11 megabits per second for IEEE 802.11b protocol devices and a relatively greater thickness indicative of 54 megabits per second for IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11g protocol devices. Thus the thickness of each power range ring may be responsive to a user selected amount of radio signal attenuation and reflects the distance in the physical space representation corresponding to the diameter of the power range ring and the type of communication protocol used by the associated wireless device. The user may also select the bottom of the six radio button in the column and then enter a value in dBm from 25 to 99 in the adjacent box. The disclosed system then fills in the appropriate available bandwidths for the provided transmit power value for the columns and .

The specific graphical representations of devices shown in the present Figures are given purely for purposes of illustration and the present invention may be embodied using other specific shapes line formats colors or designs. For example access point representations need not be represented using octagons and client station representations need not be represented using squares other specific shapes may be used as appropriate for a given embodiment. Similarly line thickness of the power range rings is just one example of how potential bandwidth may be represented and other line formats may be used to visually represent the potential bandwidth available within the power range rings. Moreover while the color of access point power range ring and client station representations is used in the exemplary embodiments to distinguish between different channels currently in use by the corresponding wireless devices other visual characteristics of such representations may alternatively be used to represent channel selection.
