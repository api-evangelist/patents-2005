The invention described herein may be manufactured and used by or for the Government for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalty thereon.

This invention relates to Faraday rotators and more particularly to water cooled Faraday rotator element.

In the optical arts a well known device is a Faraday rotator which comprises a material having the characteristic that when placed in an axial magnetic field it exhibits a different index of refraction for circularly polarized light having a direction of propagation aligned parallel with the magnetic field than for circularly polarized light having a direction of propogation antiparallel to the magnetic field. Such devices are most commonly used in optical isolators and circulators for separating the various stages of master oscillator power amplifier systems separating the transmission and reception channels in systems such as radar and line scanners using common optical components and for isolating stable lasers from feedback and backscattered radiation which causes frequency instability in laser oscillators.

An exemplary form of an isolator using a Faraday rotor is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 3 617 129 filed on Nov. 10 1969 and entitled Interferometric Optical Isolator. U.S. Pat. No. 6 785 037 Aug. 31 2004 entitled Faraday rotator Matsushita and U.S. Pat. No. 6 813 076 Nov. 2 2004 entitled Faraday rotator optical isolator polarizer and diamond like carbon thin film issued to Okubo. The systems disclosed therein are incorporated herein by reference.

Higher power tubes gyro TWT s and gyro klystrons can generate average power levels of many 10 s kilowatts and possibly 100 kw or better at millimeter wave frequencies. Proposed radars which use these tubes must necessarily use beam waveguide BWG or quasi optical techniques. Unfortunately the transmission type Faraday rotators which have been used with se BWG radars at lower power levels cannot accommodate more than a few kilowatts. A new design is required and the present invention is intended to satisfy that need.

A Lincoln Laboratory group Ref. 1 through 4 proposed a reflective F.R. in which the back surface of the ferrite disk is metalized. The incident beam is reflected into a 90 turn the angle of incidence with the ferrite disk 45 and the metalized surface is water cooled. Expected power levels are perhaps two orders of magnitude greater than the transmission type F.R. Unfortunately matching requirements for 45 differ substantially for the two orthogonal polarizations i.e. the s and p polarizations. This distorts the electrical performance of the device. The polarization rotation fluctuates and cross polarization components are introduced to the output signal. A single quarter wave matching plate performs poorly. Dual matching plates which are difficult to implement and cool theoretically improve performance but not to the level of the transmission type device.

According to the present invention an optical element having characteristics suitable for use in a Faraday rotator has bonded to each of the adjacent radiation receiving surfaces thereof with a chamber or water conducting conduit affixed therein. More specifically one embodiment of the invention includes a water cooled Faraday rotator element having a base magnet plate substrate a ferrite disk with a waffle iron grid cut into the top surface which matches the incident radiation from air into the ferrite medium and a bottom surface with a reflecting copper layer which also provides for the water cooling.

The foregoing and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent in the light of the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawing.

The present invention uses a water cooled Faraday rotator element. More specifically one embodiment of the invention as shown in includes a water cooled Faraday rotator element having a base magnet plate substrate a flowing water filled conduit fixed on the top surface of the base magnet plate substrate a ferrite waffle iron grid with a binary top surface which matches the incident radiation and which has a bottom surface and a fused copper layer fixed between the bottom surface of the ferrite waffle iron grid and the flowing water filled conduit.

FIGS. and show the reflector configuration. Two clamshell pairs are oriented at an angle 2 sufficient to avoid interference between input and output beams. The Faraday rotator is placed at the beam waist as shown with a diameter of 4 which embraces all of the Gaussian beam down the 35 dB level the contours shown in . Cancellation of the higher order mode is incomplete. A beam conversion of 2 1 Ref. 4. yields a cross polarized level of 31.5 dB. The 1.5 1 converter the example shown in . has TEMmode level of approximately 35 dB which is totally negligible. For example the system beamwaist that which efficiently illuminates the Cassegrain system for HUSIR and WARLOC is 0.42. The minimum interference between input and output reflectors is proportional to and is as follows 

Hence a conversion factor of 2 1 reduces the power density by a factor of four quadruples the power handling capability assuming adequate cooling . The angle of incidence can be reduced by a factor of 0.75 by truncating one edge of the beam to the 20 dB level. This represents a loss of about 0.01 dB.

The present invention is a near normal reflective Faraday rotator. shows a partially sectioned perspective of a Faraday rotator element that uses two clamshell reflector pairs and . shows the use of the system of incorporated into a BWG System that includes a final power amplifier an optical filter the Faraday rotator a filter a circular polarizer a sealer a multimode tracking feed and receivers and . The four clamshell reflector elements receive a signal receive and output an optical signal labeled transmit .

A cross section of the Faraday rotator is also shown in the . The quarter wave matching surface is a waffle iron pattern cut into the ferrite disk. It was pioneered with the HAX F.R. and perfected with WARLOC. It works well. The fused copper layer on the back side of the ferrite disk need be only a few skindepths thick. The WARLOC F.R. had power problems with a diamond disk bonded to the ferrite. Differential thermal forces with a whisker thin copper mirror wouldn t fracture a cigar ash. Note that the rf. power sees nothing but ferrite material and a water cooled copper mirror.

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the three quasi optical F.R. s. We have built F.R. s for the HAX 16 Ghz the MMW 35 Ghz and the WARLOC 95 Ghz radars. All of which have excellent electrical characteristics low loss low distortion etc. The highest ave. power demonstrated is 10 kw with the HAX unit. Power handling diminishes with increasing frequency. It seems a hopeless quest to find a transmission type design at the high MMW frequencies which will handle 10 s of kw.

Another problem with the transmission design is that some of the reflected power finds its way into the op receiver see requiring lossy and expensive receiver. protectors. This problem disappears completely with the reflective F.R. s.

Ordinary aluminum tubing can be used for the water conduit with a variety of commercially available water pumps to provide cooling as needed.

While the invention has been described in its presently preferred embodiment it is understood that the words which have been used are words of description rather than words of limitation and that changes within the purview of the appended claims may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention in its broader aspects.
