This application claims priority on Japanese Patent Application No. 2004 249993 filed on Aug. 30 2004 Japanese Patent Application No. 2004 249994 filed on Aug. 30 2004 Japanese Patent Application No. 2004 277168 filed on Sep. 24 2004 Japanese Patent Application No. 2005 90322 filed on Mar. 28 2005 Japanese Patent Application No. 2005 90323 filed on Mar. 28 2005 Japanese Patent Application No. 2005 96599 filed on Mar. 30 2005 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2005 108539 filed on Apr. 5 2005 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Generally conjugated conductive polymers composed of the main chain of a conjugated system containing electrons are synthesized by electrolytic polymerization or chemical oxidative polymerization.

In the electrolytic polymerization a previously prepared base such as an electrode material is immersed in a mixed solution of an electrolyte as a dopant and precursor monomers for constituting a conjugated conductive polymer to form a film of conjugated conductive polymer on the base. Therefore mass production is very difficult.

On the other hand there are no such limitations on the chemical oxidative polymerization. A large amount of a conjugated conductive polymer can be produced in a solution by adding oxidant and oxidation polymerization catalysis to precursor monomers of the conjugated conductive polymer.

However the conjugated conductive polymer is obtained as an insoluble solid power in the chemical oxidative polymerization because the polymer becomes less soluble in a solvent as the conjugated system of the main chain of the polymer grows. It is difficult to form a uniform film of a conjugated conductive polymer on a base surface if the polymer is insoluble.

Therefore some methods to solubilize the conjugated conductive polymers have been attempted. They are a method of introducing a functional group into the polymers a method of dispersing the polymers in a binder resin and a method of adding an anion group containing polymeric acid to the polymer.

For example a method of preparing an aqueous solution of poly 3 4 dialkoxythiophene by chemical oxidative polymerization of 3 4 dialkoxythiophene using oxidant in the presence of polystyrene sulfonic acid which is an anion group containing polymeric acid having a molecular weight of 2000 to 500000 in order to improve the dispersibility in water is disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2636968. A method of preparing an aqueous colloid solution of a conjugated conductive polymer by chemical oxidative polymerization of a precursor monomer of the polymer in the presence of polyacrylic acid is disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 7 165892.

According to methods disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 2636968 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 7 165892 an aqueous dispersion solution containing a conjugated conductive polymer can be easily prepared. These methods require a conjugated conductive polymer to contain a large amount of anion group containing polymeric acid for ensuring its dispersibility. Therefore the problem occurs that the obtained conductive compositions contain a large amount of compounds which do not contribute to conductivity making it difficult to achieve high conductivity.

In the chemical oxidative polymerization high oxidative oxidants cause unfavorable side reactions in high probability during chemical oxidative polymerization. Therefore the polymer structures having poor conjugated property may be produced or the produced polymer may be attacked by the oxidant once again and excessively oxidized and then the obtained conjugated conductive polymer has low conductivity. Some methods are used to solve these problems such as using transition metal ions as catalysis or allowing reaction at a low temperature for a long time. However these methods fail to sufficiently prevent conductivity from dropping because the produced polymer is attacked by protons produced by dehydrogenation of reactive monomers and therefore the conjugated conductive polymer may have low structural regularity.

Furthermore when the conductive composition contains a binder resin a conjugated conductive polymer obtained by the chemical oxidative polymerization may have low compatibility with the binder resin.

Along with recent digitalized electronic devices capacitors used in those electronic devices are required to reduce impedance in high frequency range. In order to meet this requirement conventionally a capacitor comprising a dielectric which is an oxide film of valve metals such as aluminum tantalum and niobium and a cathode comprising a conjugated conductive polymer formed on the surface of the oxide film.

A capacitor generally comprises an anode consisting of a porous material of valve metal a dielectric layer formed by oxidizing the surface of the anode and a cathode formed by laminating a solid electrolyte layer a carbon layer and a silver layer on the dielectric layer as shown in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 2003 37024. The solid electrolyte layer of a capacitor is composed of a conjugated conductive polymer such as pyrrole or thiophene. The solid electrolyte layer penetrates into the porous material and the electrolyte is in contact with the dielectric layer in a larger area for higher electrostatic capacity and restores defective parts of the dielectric layer for preventing current leakage.

Known methods of forming a conjugated conductive polymer include electrolytic polymerization Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 63 158829 and chemical oxidative polymerization Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 63 173313 .

In electrolytic polymerization a conductive layer of manganese oxide must be previously formed on the porous material surface of the valve metal. This method is complicated and troublesome and further manganese oxide has low conductivity and then the effect of using a high conductive conjugated conductive polymer is impaired.

The chemical oxidative polymerization requires a long polymerization time. It also requires repeated polymerization to ensure thickness. Therefore the capacitor suffers from low production efficiency and low conductivity.

Furthermore a method that eliminates the step of forming a conductive polymer on a dielectric layer in the electrolytic polymerization or chemical oxidative polymerization is proposed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 7 105718. Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 7 105718 describes a method in which aniline is polymerized in the presence of a polymeric acid containing a sulfo group and carboxy group to prepare water soluble polyaniline and the polyaniline aqueous solution is applied to the dielectric layer and dried. This method is simple. However the polyaniline solution does not sufficiently penetrate into the porous material and a polymeric acid used along with a conjugated conductive polymer leads to low conductivity which in some cases may be temperature dependent because of the polymeric acid.

Capacitors are desired to have low equivalent series resistance ESR which is an index for impedance. To decrease ESR conductivity of the solid electrolyte layer should be increased. Highly sophisticated control over conditions of the chemical oxidative polymerization is proposed to improve the conductivity of a solid electrolyte layer in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 11 74157. However the proposed method may further complicate complicated and troublesome chemical oxidative polymerization failing to simplify the process and reduce costs.

In some cases conjugated conductive polymers are used as an organic material which has a conductive mechanism of electronic conduction.

Resin films themselves are insulators and easily electrically charged. Furthermore resin films tend to charge static electricity by friction or the like. Moreover static electricity is not easily removed but rather accumulates causing various problems.

Particularly when resin films are used for wrapping food materials in which sanitary considerations are emphasized they may absorb dirt and dust and become largely deteriorated in appearance while on the shelves which reduces the product s value. When resin films are used for wrapping powders they absorb or repel powder that is charged while being wrapped or in use making it inconvenient and difficult to handle the powder. When resin films are used for wrapping precision electronic devices the precision electronic device may be broken due to static electricity. Therefore steps must be taken to assure that static electricity does not occur.

Optical filters and optical information recording media are required that surfaces thereof are highly hard and transparent and further comprise antistatic property for preventing adhesion of dust with static electricity. Particularly the antistatic properties are required that a surface resistance value is stably within approximately 10to 10 namely stable antistatic properties . Therefore an antistatic coating having antistatic and highly hard is provided on the surfaces of optical filters and optical information recording media.

For imparting antistatic properties for example a method that a resin film or surfactant is applied to the surface or a method that a surfactant is mixed into a resin film or a resin composing an antistatic coating have been adopted for example see Fine Chemical Antistatic Agents Latest Market Trend the first volume Vol.16 No.15 1987 p. 24 36 published by CMC .

However since antistatic properties obtained by surfactants have a conductive mechanism of ion conduction the surfactants are largely influenced by humidity and therefore optical filters and optical information recording media are highly conductive at high humidity and poorly conductive at low humidity. Hence the antistatic function is impaired and the antistatic ability is not exerted at need at low humidity and particularly under circumstances where static electricity easily occurs.

If metals and carbon having a conductive mechanism of electronic conduction are used humidity dependence is eliminated. However since they do not have transparency they are useless where transparency is required.

Metal oxides such as ITO Indium Tin Oxide have transparency and have a conductive mechanism of electronic conduction. Therefore metal oxides are suitably used in transparency. However if metal oxides are used it is necessary to include a process using a sputtering apparatus or the like for making a film so that processes are complicated and production costs become high. Furthermore since inorganic metal oxide coatings have less flexibility if the inorganic metal oxide is coated on a thin film base the coating is extremely subject to cracks and does not exhibit conductivity. Moreover since they have low adhesion property to an organic base the inorganic metal oxide may be peeled off the organic base at the interface thereof and transparency may be decreased.

Known organic materials having a conductive mechanism of electronic conduction include conjugated conductive polymers. Generally conjugated conductive polymers are insoluble and non melting. Therefore it is difficult to apply them to a film base after polymerization and an attempt is made in which aniline is polymerized in the presence of a polymeric acid having a sulfo group to form a water soluble polyaniline and the obtained mixture is applied to a film base and dried for example see Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 1 254764 .

An antistatic coating can be formed by directly polymerizing it on a base as in the method described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application First Publication No. 1 25476. In such a case the antistatic coating has a low conductivity and shows poor adhesion to resin base due to water solubility and further the production process becomes more complicated.

The second object of the present invention is to provide a capacitor comprising a cathode having a highly conductive solid electrolyte layer and low impedance and a method of producing the capacitor in a simple manner.

Among the organic acids solubilizing polymers containing anion groups hereinafter referred to anion group containing solubilizing polymer are preferred. The anion group containing solubilizing polymer is preferably used because it does not only function as a dopant but also satisfactory solubilizes a conjugated conductive polymer in a solvent which makes the polymer usable as a coating material.

The anion group containing solubilizing polymer may be for example substituted or un substituted polyalkylenes substituted or un substituted polyalkenylenes substituted or un substituted polyimides substituted or un substituted polyamides and substituted or un substituted polyesters. Some of these are polymers comprising anion group containing units only and the others are polymers comprising anion group containing units and no anion group containing units.

Polyalkylene is a polymer repeatedly containing methylene in the main chain. Polyalkenylene can be a polymer having the main chain comprising units each containing one vinyl group. Particularly substituted or un substituted butenylenes are preferred because of the interaction between the unsaturated bond and a conjugated conductive polymer and easy synthesis using substituted or un substituted butadienes as a starting material.

Examples of polyimides include those from acid anhydrides such as pyromellitic dianhydride biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride 2 2 3 3 tetracarboxydiphenylether dianhydride and 2 2 4 4 di dicarboxyphenyloxy phenyl propane dianhydride and diamines such as oxydianiline paraphenylenediamine metaphenylenediamine and benzophenonediamine.

When the aforementioned polymers have substituent specific examples of the substituents are alkyl hydroxy carboxy cyano phenyl phenol ester alkoxy and carbonyl group.

The alkyl group improves solubility and dispersibility into polar or non polar solvents and compatibility with and dispersibility in resins. The hydroxy group facilitates the hydrogen bond to other hydrogen atoms improving solubility in organic solvents and compatibility with dispersibility in and adhesion property to resins. The cyano and hydroxyphenyl groups improve compatibility with and solubility in polar resins. They also improve heat resistance. Among them alkyl hydroxy ester and cyano groups are preferable.

Example of the alkyl group include alkyl groups such as methyl ethyl propyl butyl isobutyl t butyl pentyl hexyl octyl decyl and dodecyl and cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopropyl cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Alkyl groups having a carbon number between 1 and 12 are preferable in view of solubility in organic solvents dispersibility in resins and steric hindrance.

The hydroxyl group can be for example a hydroxy group directly bonded to the main chain of an anion group containing solubilizing polymer a hydroxyl group bonded to the end of an alkyl group having a carbon number between 1 and 7 bonded to the main chain of an anion group containing solubilizing polymer or a hydroxyl group bonded to the end of an alkenyl group having a carbon number between 2 and 7 bonded to the main chain of an anion group containing solubilizing polymer. Among them a hydroxyl group bonded to the end of an alkyl group having a carbon number between 1 and 6 bonded to the main chain is preferable in view of compatibility with resins and solubility in solvents.

The ester group can be for example an alkyl ester or aromatic ester groups directly bonded to the main chain of an anion group containing solubilizing polymer or an alkyl ester or aromatic ester group bonded thereto via another functional group.

The cyano group can be for example a cyano group directly bonded to the main chain of an anion group containing solubilizing polymer a cyano group bonded to the end of an alkyl group having a carbon number between 1 and 7 bonded to the main chain of an anion group containing solubilizing polymer or a cyano group bonded to the end of an alkenyl group having a carbon number between 2 and 7 bonded to the main chain of an anion group containing solubilizing polymer.

Any anion group can be contained in the anion group containing solubilizing polymer and among them monosubstituted sulfuric acid ester monosubstituted phosphoric acid ester carboxy and sulfo groups are preferable in view of easy production and stability. Sulfo group is further preferable in view of doping effect of functional groups on the conjugated conductive polymer. In other words sulfo group containing solubilizing polymers are further preferable anion group containing solubilizing polymers.

The sulfo group containing solubilizing polymer has a sulfo group in a polymer side chain. The main chain of a solubilizing polymer can be for example polyalkylene repeatedly comprising methylene or a polyalkenylene consisting of units each containing a vinyl group in the main chain. The sulfo group can be introduced by direct sulfonation sulfation using fuming sulfuric acid sulfonation using a sulfonating agent sulfonation through sulfonic group transposition and polymerization of sulfo group containing polymerizable monomers.

In the polymerization of sulfo group containing polymerizable monomers sulfo group containing polymerizable monomers and if necessary other no sulfo group containing polymerizable monomers are polymerized by chemical oxidative polymerization in the presence of oxidant and or oxidative polymerization catalysis.

Any sulfo group containing polymerizable monomers can be used as long as they have sulfo substituents at appropriate positions. Examples of such monomers include substituted or un substituted ethylene sulfonic acid compounds substituted or un substituted styrenesulfonic acid compounds substituted heterocyclicsulfonic acid compounds substituted acrylamide sulfonic acid compounds substituted or un substituted cyclovinylenesulfonic acid compounds substituted or un substituted butadienesulfonic acid compounds and vinylaromaticsulfonic acid compounds.

Among them vinylsulfonic acid sulfoethyl methacrylate sulfoethyl methacrylate salt 4 sulfobutylmethacrylate 4 sulfobutylmethacrylate salt styrenesulfonic acid styrene sulfonate isoprene sulfonic acid and isoprene sulfonate are preferable.

The other no sulfo group containing polymerizable monomers can be substituted or un substituted ethylene compounds substituted acrylic acid compounds substituted or un substituted styrenes substituted or un substituted vinylamines unsaturated group containing heterocyclic compounds substituted or un substituted acrylamide compounds substituted or un substituted cyclovinylene compounds substituted or un substituted butadiene compounds substituted or un substituted vinylaromatic compounds substituted or un substituted divinylbenzene compounds substituted vinylphenol compounds any substituted silylstyrene and any substituted phenol compounds.

Examples of the anion group containing solubilizing polymer include polyvinylsulfonic acid polystyrenesulfonic acid polyallylsulfonic acid ethyl polyacrylatesulfonic acid butyl polyacrylatesulfonic acid polyacrylsulfonic acid polymethacrylsulfonic acid poly 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropanesulfonic acid polyisoprenesulfonic acid polystyrene carboxylic acid poly 2 acrylamide 2 methylpropane carboxylic acid polyisoprenecarboxylic acid and polyacrylic acid. They can be used as individually or in combination of two or more.

The dopant can be preferably used in the conductive composition in an amount of 0.1 to 10 mol more preferably 0.5 to 7 mol to 1 mol of a conjugated conductive polymer. When the dopant content is less than 0.1 mol the doping effect of the dopant on the conjugated conductive polymer tends to be reduced resulting in insufficient conductivity. When the dopant content is more than 10 mol the conductive composition contains a smaller amount of conjugated conductive polymer resulting in insufficient conductivity.

The solubilizing polymer in the antistatic coating material has an anion group and or an electron attractive group in the molecules and solubilizes the conjugated conductive polymer in a solvent. The solubilizing polymer also functions as a dopant.

The solubilizing polymer containing an electron attractive group in the molecules hereinafter referred to the electron attractive group containing solubilizing polymer can be a polymer comprising as a unit at least one compound selected from cyano nitro formyl carbonyl and acetyl groups.

Examples of the electron attractive group containing solubilizing polymer include polyacrylonitrile polymethacrylonitrile acrylonitrile sryrene resin acrylonitrile butadiene resin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin resin obtained by cyanoethylating hydroxyl or amino containing resin polyvinylpyrrolidone alkylated polyvinylpyrrolidone and nitrocellulose.

Among these acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile having a cyano containing compound as a unit are preferred. The cyano group is a highly polar group and therefore improves compatibility with and dispersibility in binder resin components.

Solubilizing polymer can be a copolymer such as a copolymer of two or more of the aforementioned anion group containing solubilizing polymer and electron attractive group containing solubilizing polymer a copolymer comprising units having different anion groups and a copolymer comprising units having different electron attractive groups.

Solubilizing polymer further can be a polymer copolymerized with other vinyl compounds such as halogenated vinyl compounds aromatic vinyl and or their derivatives heterocyclic vinyl compounds and or their derivatives aliphatic vinyl compounds and or their derivatives acryl compounds diene compounds and maleimide compounds.

Examples of the vinyl compounds include polymerizable vinyl compounds such as styrene butadiene acrylic acid methacrylic acid hydroxylacrylic acid hydroxymethacrylic acid acrylic acid ester methacrylic acid ester and p vinyltoluene. The copolymerization with these other vinyl compounds serves to control solvent solubility and compatibility with binder resins.

The solubilizing polymer can contain synthetic rubber components for modifying impact resistance antiaging agents for improving environment resistance antioxidant and UV absorbents. Amine compounds as antioxidant may inhibit the action of the oxidant for polymerizing the aforementioned conductive polymer. Therefore phenol compounds may be used as antioxidant or the antioxidant is mixed after the polymerization.

The nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound has an aromatic ring having at least one or more nitrogen atoms wherein the nitrogen atoms in the aromatic ring are conjugated to other atoms in the aromatic ring. To be conjugated the nitrogen and other atoms have an unsaturated bond or the nitrogen atoms are adjacent to other atoms having an unsaturated bond when the nitrogen and other atoms themselves do not have an unsaturated bond. An unshared electrons pair on the nitrogen atoms can form a pseudo conjugation to the unsaturated bond formed between other atoms.

It is preferred that the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound be provided with both the nitrogen atom conjugated to another atom and the nitrogen atom adjacent to another atom having an unsaturated bond.

The nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound can be for example pyridine having a nitrogen atom and their derivatives imidazoles having two nitrogen atoms and their derivatives pyrimidines and their derivatives pyrazines and their derivatives and triazines having three nitrogen atoms and their derivatives.

The nitrogen atom of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound has an unshared electron pair. Therefore a substituent or a proton coordinates or bind to the nitrogen atom. When a substituent or a proton easily coordinates or binds to the nitrogen atom the nitrogen atom tends to be positively charged. Because the nitrogen and another atom are conjugated the positive charge produced by the constituent or proton coordinated or bound to the nitrogen atom is dispersed and stably present in the nitrogen containing aromatic ring.

Therefore the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound can be a cation of a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound with a substituent introduced in the nitrogen atom. Further the cation and an anion can be combined to form a salt. The nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound in the form of a salt has the same effect as the non cation form of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound.

The substituent that can be introduced in the nitrogen atom of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound can be hydrogen or alkyl hydroxyl carboxy cyano phenyl phenol ester alkoxy or carbonyl group.

Examples of the alkyl group include alkyl groups such as methyl ethyl propyl butyl isobutyl t butyl pentyl hexyl octyl decyl and dodecyl and cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopropyl cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Among them alkyl groups having a carbon number between 1 and 12 are preferred in view of solubility in organic solvents dispersibility in resins and steric hindrance.

Examples of the hydroxy group include hydroxy alkylenehydroxy groups such as methylenehydroxy ethylenehydroxy trimethylenehydroxy tetramethylenehydroxy pentamethylenehydroxy hexamethylenehydroxy heptamethylenehydroxy propylenehydroxy butylenehydroxy and ethylmethylenehydroxy and alkenylenehydroxy groups such as propenylenehydroxy butenylenehydroxy and pentenylenehydroxy.

Examples of anions of that form salts together with a cation of a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound include halogen sulfate ion chlorite and organic sulfonate ions. The aforementioned organic sulfonic acids can be used.

For example in the antistatic coating material part of the incorporated nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound coordinates or binds to protons or other functional groups from the dopant being positively charged and becoming a cation of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound. Therefore the incorporated nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound is present in the antistatic coating material as a mixture of a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic cation compound and a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound that does not coordinate or bind. The nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic cation compound and nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound form salts together with excessive anion groups or electron attractive groups of the dopant are attracted to the dopant and penetrate into the molecules of the conjugated conductive polymer of the antistatic coating material. The presence of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic cation compound and nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound between the molecules of the conjugated conductive polymer causes the hopping energy for electric conductivity of the conjugated conductive polymer to drop and therefore improves the electric conductivity of the antistatic coating material.

The nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound preferably has a cross linkable functional group for improved conductivity and heat resistance. A nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound having a cross linkable functional group is hereinafter termed the cross linkable nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound.

A cross linkable functional group is a functional group that reacts with and links to a functional group of the same type or of a different type.

The cross linkable functional group can bind to the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound directly or via a functional group such as substituted or un substituted methylene substituted or un substituted ethylene and substituted or un substituted propylene.

The cross linkable functional group can be introduced into a nitrogen atom or a carbon atom of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound.

The cross linkable functional group can be for example vinyl carboxy hydroxy amino or ester group. Among them the vinyl carboxy and hydroxy groups are preferred because they are highly reactive and cross linkable.

The cross linkable nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound can be for example a pyridine having a cross linkable functional group and their derivatives and imidazole having a cross linkable functional group and their derivatives.

Examples of the pyridines having a cross linkable functional group and their derivatives include 2 vinylpyridine 4 vinylpyridine 2 methyl 6 vinylpyridine 5 methyl 2 vinylpyridine 4 butenylpyridine 4 pentenylpyridine 2 4 pyridyl alcohol 4 1 butenylpentenyl pyridine 2 pyridine carboxylic acid 4 pyridine carboxylic acid 6 methyl 2 pyridine carboxylic acid 2 3 pyridine dicarboxylic acid 2 3 pyridine dicarboxylic acid 2 5 pyridine dicarboxylic acid 2 6 pyridine dicarboxylic acid 4 hydroxypyridine 2 6 dihydroxypyridine 6 hydroxy methyl nicotinate 2 hydroxy 5 pyridinemethanol 6 hydroxy ethyl nicotinate 4 pyridine methanol 4 pyridine ethanol and 2 pyridine carbonitrile.

Examples of the imidazoles having a cross linkable functional group and their derivatives include N vinylimidazole N allylimidazole 2 methyl 4 vinylimidazole 2 methyl 1 vinylimidazole imidazole 4 carboxylic acid 4 5 imidazole dicarboxylic acid 1 2 hydroxyethyl imidazole 2 hydroxymethylimidazole 4 hydroxymethylimidazole 2 butyl 4 hydroxymethylimidazole 2 methyl 4 hydroxymethylimidazole 4 hydroxymethyl 2 methylimidazole 1 benzyl 2 hydroxybenzimidazole methylimidazole 4 catboxylate ethylimidazole 4 carboxylate and 4 5 imidazole dimethyl dicarboxylate.

The nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound is preferably used in an amount of 0.1 to 100 mol more preferably 1 to 30 mol to 1 mole of dopant and or solubilizing polymer. The range from 1 to 30 mol is preferred in view of physical properties and conductivity of the coating. When the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound is used in an amount of less than 0.1 mol the interaction between the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound and the dopant and conjugated conductive polymer tends to decrease possibly resulting in insufficient conductivity. When the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound is used in an amount of greater than 100 mol the content of the conjugated conductive polymer is excessively low here again possibly resulting in insufficient conductivity.

The cross linkable nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound contained preferably contains a cross linkable compound.

The cross linkable compound is preferably a compound having a vinyl group when the cross linkable functional group is a vinyl group and is preferably a compound having a hydroxy or amino group when the cross linkable functional group is a carboxy group and is preferably a compound having a carboxy group when the cross linkable functional group is a hydroxy group.

With the cross linkable compound being introduced the cross linkable functional group of the cross linkable nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound is easily cross linked thereby ensuring stability.

Examples of the cross linkable compound include methyl acrylate ethyl acrylate propyl acrylate butyl acrylate isobutyl acrylate isooctyl acrylate isononylbutyl acrylate allyl acrylate ethyl methacrylate hydroxyethyl acrylate methoxyethyl acrylate methoxybutyl acrylate stearyl acrylate acryloylmorpholine vinyl containing compounds such as vinylamine N N dimethylvinylamine N N diethylvinylamine N N dibutylvinylamine N N t butylvinylamine N N diphenylvinylamine N vinylcarbazole vinyl alcohol vinyl chloride vinyl fluoride vinyl ether acrylonitrile N vinyl 2 pyrrolidone and acrylamide N N dimethylacrylamide carboxy containing compounds such as carboxylic acid phthalic acid acrylic acid and polyacrylic aid and hydroxy containing compounds such as butanol ethylene glycol and vinyl alcohol.

When the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound has a cross linkable functional group it is preferred to add a polymerization initiator. The polymerization initiator can be for example acids alkalis radical generators or oxidants. It is preferred that the polymerization initiator be selected according to the type of the cross linkable functional group. When the cross linkable functional group is a vinyl group radical generators and alkalis are preferable. When the cross linkable functional group is a carboxy or hydroxy group acids and alkalis are preferable.

The conductive composition may contain a binder resin for adjusting coating properties such as coating formation strength and electric conductivity. The binder resin is preferably contained in view of the antistatic coating material because the coating has a harder surface and improved damage resistance and adhesion to a base. When an antistatic coating material contains a binder resin an antistatic coating formed by antistatic coating material easily has a pencil hardness JIS K 5400 of HB or harder.

The binder resin is not limited as long as it is compatible with or mixable dispersible in the essential components of the conductive composition. The binder resin can be a reactive or nonreactive resin. The binder resin can be a heat curable resin or a thermoplastic resin as long as it is compatible with or mixable dispersible in the antistatic coating material. Examples of the binder resin include polyester resin such as polyethylene phthalate polybutylene phthalate and polyethylene naphthalate polyimide resin such as polyimide and polyamideimide polyamide resin such as polyamide 6 polyamide 6 6 polyamide 12 and polyamide 11 fluorine resin such as polyvinylidene fluoride polyvinyl fluoride polytetrafluoroethylene ethylenetetrafluoroethylene copolymer and polychlorotrifluoroethylene vinyl resin such as polyvinyl alcohol polyvinylether polyvinyl butyral polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl chloride epoxy resin xylene resin aramide resin polyurethane resin polyurea resin melamine resin phenol resin polyether and acrylic resin and their copolymers.

The binder resin used in the antistatic coating material can be dissolved in an organic solvent or in water with a functional group such as a sulfo or carboxy group being added or dispersed in water to form an emulsion.

Among these one or more binder resins are preferably selected from polyurethane polyester acrylic resin polyamide polyimide epoxy resin and polyimide silicone because these are easy to mix. Acrylic resin is suitable for applications such as optical filters because of excellent hardness and transparence.

The acrylic resin preferably contains a heat curable or photo curable liquid polymer. The heat curable liquid polymer can be for example a reactive polymer or a self cross linkable polymer.

The reactive polymer is a polymer formed by polymerizing monomers having a substituent such as carboxy group acid anhydride oxetanes glycidyl group and amino group. Examples of the monomers include carboxylic acid compounds such as malonic acid succinic acid glutamic acid pimelic acid ascorbic acid phthalic acid acetylsalicylic acid adipic acid isophthalic acid benzoic acid and m toluic acid acid anhydrides such as maleic acid anhydride phthalic acid anhydride dodecylsuccinic acid anhydride dichlormaleic acid anhydride tetrachlorphthalic acid anhydride and pyromellitic acid anhydride oxetane compounds such as 3 3 dimethyloxetane 3 3 dichloromethyloxetane 3 methyl 3 hydroxymethyloxetane and azidomethylmethyloxetane glycidyl ether compounds such as bisphenol A diglycidyl ether bisphenol F diglycidyl ether phenolnovolacpolyglycidyl ether N N diglycidyl p aminophenolglycidyl ether tetrabromobisphenol A diglycidyl ether hydrogenerated bisphenol A diglycidyl ether namely 2 2 bis 4 glycidyloxycyclohexyl propane glycidyl amine compounds such as N N diglycidylaniline tetradiglycidyldiaminodiphenylmethane N N N N tetraglycidyl m xylylenediamine triglycidylisocyanurate and N N diglycidyl 5 5 dialkylhydantoin amine compounds such as diethylenetriamine triethylenetetramine dimethylaminopropylamine N aminoethylpiperazine benzyldimethylamine tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol DHP30 tri 2 ethylhexoate metaphenylenediamine diaminophenylmethane diaminodiphenylsulfone dicyandiamide boron trifluoride monoethylamine menthanediamine xylenediamine and ethylmethylimidazole and glycidyl compounds from bisphenol A epichlorohydrin among compounds having two or more oxirane rings per molecule and their analogs.

A cross linker having at least two or more functional groups is used for the reactive polymerization. The cross linker can be for example melamine resin epoxy resin or metal oxide. As for the metal oxide basic metal compounds such as Al OH Al OOC.CH OOCH Al OOC.CH ZrO OCH Mg OOC.CH Ca OH and Ba OH can be used as appropriate.

The self cross linkable polymerization involves self cross linking between functional groups when heated and involve for example glycidyl and carboxyl groups or N methylol and carboxy group.

The photo curable liquid polymer may be for example polyester epoxy resin oxetane resin polyacryl polyurethane polyimide polyamide polyamideimide and polyimide silicone oligomers or prepolymers.

Examples of monomer units constituting a photo curable liquid polymer include monofunctional and polyfunctional monomers of the following acrylates such as bisphenol A ethyleneoxide modified diacrylate dipentaerythritolhexa penta acrylate dipentaerythritolmonohydroxypentaacrylate dipropyleneglycol diacrylate trimethylolpropanetriacrylate glycerinpropoxytriacrylate 4 hydroxybutylacrylate 1 6 hexadioldiacrylate 2 hydroxyethlacrylate 2 hydroxypropylacrylate isobornylacrylate polyethyleneglycoldiacrylate pentaerythritoltriacrylate tetrahydroffurfurylacrylate tripropyleneglycoldiacrylate methacrylates such as tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate alkylmethacrylate allylmethacrylate 1 3 butyleneglycol dimethacrylate n butylmethacrylate benzylmethacrylate cyclohexylmethacrylate diethyleneglycol dimethacrylate 2 ethylhexylmethacrylate glycidylmethacrylate 1 6 hexanediol dimethacrylate 2 hydroxyethylmethacrylate isobornylmethacrylate laurylmethacrylate phenoxyethylmethacrylate t butylmethacrylate tetrahydrofurfurylmethacrylate and trimethylolpropanetrimethacrylate glycidyl ethers such as allylglycidyl ether butylglycidyl ether higher alcohol glycidyl ether 1 6 hexanediolglycidyl ether phenylglycidyl ether and stearylglycidyl ether acryl methacryl amides such as diacetonacrylamide N N dimethylacrylamide dimethylaminopropylacrylamide dimethylaminopropylmethacrylamide methacrylamide N methylolacrylamide N N dimethylacrylamide acryloylmorpholine N vinylformamide N methylacrylamide N isopropylacrylamide N t butylacrylamide N phenylacrylamide acryloylpiperidine and 2 hydroxyethylacrylamide vinyl ethers such as 2 chloroethylvinyl ether cyclohexylvinyl ether ethylvinyl ether hydroxybutylvinyl ether isobutylvinyl ether triethyleneglycol vinyl ether carboxylic acid vinyl esters such as vinyl lactate vinyl monochloroacetate vinyl pivalate.

The photo curable liquid polymer cures with a photopolymerization initiator. The photopolymerization initiator can be for example acetophenone benzophenones Michler s benzoylbenzoate amyloxime ester tetramethylthiurammonosulfide or thioxanthone. A photosensitizer such as n butylamine triethylamine and tri n butylphosphine can be mixed.

The conductive composition may contain solvents. The aforementioned solvents capable of dissolving or dispersing precursor monomers of a conjugated conductive polymer may be used.

The solvent used in the antistatic coating material and capacitor is not limited and may be for example alcohol solvents such as methanol ethanol isopropyl alcohol IPA amide solvents such as N methylpyrrolidone NMP and dimethylacetamide DMAc dimethylformamide DMF ketone solvents such as methylethylketone MEK acetone and cyclohexane ester solvents such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate toluene xylene and water. These can be used individually or in combination. Among them in view of recent environmental considerations environmental friendly water and alcohol solvents are preferred.

The aforementioned conductive composition can be prepared by for example chemical oxidative polymerizing precursor monomers of a conjugated conductive polymer in the presence of dopant and oxidant or oxidation polymerization catalysis and then adding a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound thereto.

For chemical oxidative polymerizing a conjugated conductive polymer the dopant forms a salt together with the conjugated conductive polymer and the conjugated conductive polymer is doped as it grows. Particularly when the dopant is a sulfo group containing solubilizing polymer the sulfo group aggressively forms a salt together with the conjugated conductive polymer therefore the conjugated conductive polymer is strongly attracted to the main chain of the sulfo group containing solubilizing polymer dopant. Consequently the main chain of the conjugated conductive polymer grows along the main chain of the sulfo group containing solubilizing polymer dopant thereby a regularly aligned conjugated conductive polymer is easily formed. Forming a number of salts together with the sulfo group containing solubilizing polymer dopant the conjugated conductive polymer synthesized in this manner is anchored to the main chain of the sulfo group containing solubilizing polymer dopant and forms a mixture with it.

By adding a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound to the mixture of the conjugated conductive polymer and dopant the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound penetrates between the conjugated conductive polymer and the dopant to form a conductive composition.

The aforementioned conductive composition contains a conjugated conductive polymer a dopant and a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound. In this conductive compound part of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound partly coordinates or binds to protons or substituents from the dopant being positively charged and becoming a cation of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound. Therefore a mixture of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound cation and the remaining nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound is present in the conductive composition. This mixture forms salts together with excessive anion groups of the dopant is attracted to the dopant penetrate into the conjugated conductive polymer of the conductive composition. The presence of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic cation compound and nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound within the conjugated conductive polymer causes the hopping energy for the electric conductivity of the conjugated conductive polymer to drop and therefore improve the electric conductivity.

The conductive cross linked product of the present invention is formed by heating and or irradiating with ultraviolet ray a conductive composition containing a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound having a cross linkable functional group.

The conductive cross linked product can be formed by for example applying a conductive composition solution to a base and removing the solvent by an appropriate technique which is followed by heating and or UV irradiation.

The conductive composition solution can be applied by for example immersion comma coating spray coating roll coating or gravure printing.

Either one or both of heat and UV irradiation treatments are selected according to the type of the cross linkable functional group. Heating can be done by a conventional technique such as hot air heating and infrared heating. UV irradiation can done be by using a light source such as super high pressure mercury lamp high pressure mercury lamp low pressure mercury lamp carbon arc xenon arc and metal halide lamp.

Because the cross linkable nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound is cross linked the conductive cross linked product is highly compact consequently being not only highly conductive but also highly heat resistant thermally stable and solvent resistant.

An embodiment of the capacitor of the present invention and the production method thereof is described below.

The valve metal of anode may be for example aluminum tantalum niobium titanium hafnium zirconium zinc tungsten bismuth or antimony. Among them aluminum tantalum and niobium are preferred.

Specifically the anode may be an aluminum foil that is etched for an extended surface area and oxidized on the surface or a pellet formed by sintering tantalum or niobium particles and oxidizing the surface of the sintered mass. The anodes prepared in these ways have a rough surface.

The dielectric layer is formed by anodizing the surface of the anode in an electrolyte such as an aqueous ammonium adipate. As shown in the dielectric layer also has a rough surface like the anode .

The cathode comprises a solid electrolyte layer and a cathode conductive layer made of for example carbon silver or aluminum deposited on the solid electrolyte layer . The solid electrolyte layer contains a conjugated conductive polymer and provided on the dielectric layer side.

When the cathode conductive layer is made of carbon silver and the like it can be formed using a conductive paste containing carbon silver and the like. When the cathode conductive layer is made of aluminum it can be formed using for example aluminum foil.

The electron donor compound of a capacitor having an electron donor compound layer containing an electron donor element is a compound containing an electron donor element not a polymer.

The electron donor element contained in an electron donor compound is preferably at least one or more elements selected from nitrogen oxygen phosphorus and sulfur among the elements in the groups and of the periodic table of the elements because the electric affinity between the dielectric layer and the cathode containing a conjugated conductive polymer is improved.

The nitrogen containing electron donor compound is preferably primary amine secondary amine or tertiary amine for improved electric affinity between the dielectric layer and the cathode. Examples of amines specifically include aliphatic amines such as ethylamine diethylamine methylethylamine and triethylamine and aromatic amines such as aniline benzylamine pyrrole imidazole pyridine pyrimidine pyrazine and triazine and their derivatives.

The oxygen containing electron donor compound may be for example alcohols ethers and ketones. Their examples specifically include lauryl alcohol hexadecyl alcohol benzyl alcohol ethylene glycol propylene glycol glycerin diphenyl ether cyclohexane diacetone alcohol isophorone furan and their derivatives.

The phosphorus containing electron donor compound may be for example phosphoric acid ester phosphorous acid ester phosphonic acid alykylphosphine or alykylphosphonium salt. Their examples specifically include trimethyl phosphate triphenyl phosphate trimethyl phosphite triethyl phosphite dimethyl phosphonate diethyl phosphonate triethylphosphine tri n butylphosphine tri n butylphosphineoxide tetraethylphosphoniumbromide and tetra n butylphosphoniumbromide.

The sulfur containing electron donor compound may be for example sulfides thiols isothiocyanates thiophenes and their derivatives. Their examples specifically include dimethysulfide diethylsulfide methylmercaptan ethylmercaptan phenylisothiocyanate n butylisothiocyanate thiophene and 3 methylthiophene.

Among these electron donor compounds compounds containing nitrogen oxygen or sulfur in the aromatic ring are preferred because the equivalent series resistance does not drop even though they remain in the dielectric layer. Compounds containing nitrogen in the aromatic ring include pyrrole and their derivatives pyrroles imidazole pyridine pyrimidine pyrazine pyrazine and triazine and their derivatives. Compounds containing oxygen in the aromatic ring include furan and their derivatives furans . Compounds containing sulfur in the aromatic ring include thiophene and their derivatives thiophenes . Among these at least one compound selected from pyrroles thiophenes and furans is preferable because the electric affinity between the dielectric layer and the cathode is improved.

The nitrogen oxygen or sulfur atom of an electron donor compound containing nitrogen oxygen or sulfur in the aromatic ring has an unshared electron pair. Therefore a substituent or a proton is easily coordinated or bound to these atoms. When a substituent or a proton is easily coordinated or bound to the nitrogen oxygen or sulfur atom the atoms tend to be positively charged. The nitrogen oxygen or sulfur atom is conjugated to another atom. The cationic charge generated by the substituent or proton coordinated or bound to these atoms is diffused and stably present in the aromatic ring.

Therefore electron donor compounds containing nitrogen oxygen or sulfur in the aromatic ring may be in the form of a cation with a substituent being introduced in a nitrogen oxygen or sulfur atom. Further the cation may form a salt together with an anion. Electron donor compounds in the form of a salt exert the same effect as non cation electron donor compounds.

The aforementioned capacitor has an electron donor compound applied to the dielectric layer surface. The dielectric layer surface is neutralized in terms of charge. Therefore the electric affinity between the dielectric layer and the solid electrolyte layer containing a conjugated conductive polymer is improved. Consequently the resistance at the interface between the dielectric layer and the cathode is reduced the capacitor has low impedance and high electrostatic capacity.

An embodiment of the method of producing a capacitor comprising the steps of a first step of oxidizing a surface of an anode composed of a porous material of valve metal and forming a dielectric layer a second step of applying an electron donor compound containing an electron donor element to a surface of the dielectric layer and forming an electron donor compound layer and a third step of forming a solid electrolyte layer containing a conjugated conductive polymer on a surface of the electron donor compound layer.

In the method of producing a capacitor the anode surface can be oxidized by for example anodizing the anode surface in an electrolyte solution such as an aqueous ammonium adipate.

The electron donor compound can be applied to the dielectric layer surface by a known application technique such as coating immersion and spray. When the electron donor compound is in a solid form the electron donor compound is dissolved in a solvent before it is applied. In such a case it is preferred that the solvent be removed through drying after the application. It is also preferred that the solvent be removed when a liquid electron donor compound is diluted for use.

The concentration of the electron donor compound is not limited. However the effect may not be apparent when it is excessively low. On the other hand the ESR may drop when it is excessively high. The concentration is preferably 1 to 80 by weight more preferably 5 to 50 by weight.

A layer containing a conjugated conductive polymer is preferably formed by applying a conductive polymer solution of the conjugated conductive polymer dissolved in a solvent to the dielectric layer surface because it is simple and the electric affinity between the dielectric layer and cathode can be easily improved. Alternatively precursor monomers composing a conjugated conductive polymer can be directly chemical oxidative polymerized or electrolytic polymerized on the dielectric layer.

A conductive polymer solution is obtained by polymerizing precursor monomers of a conjugated conductive polymer in the presence of anion containing solubilizing polymer or obtained by dissolving a conjugated conductive polymer having solvent solubility into a solvent.

An example of a preparation method of a conductive polymer solution by polymerizing precursor monomers of a conjugated conductive polymer in the presence of anion containing solubilizing polymer comprises the steps of dissolving an anion containing solubilizing polymer into a solvent which is able to dissolve the polymer adding precursor monomers of a conjugated conductive polymer to the obtained solution polymerizing the precursor monomers by adding an oxidant and then removing the excess oxidant and precursor monomers and purifying to obtain the conductive polymer solution.

The conductive polymer solution may contain a dopant except the anion containing solubilizing polymer in order to improve conductivity of the conjugated conductive polymer. The dopant is selected from the above described examples.

The ratio of a conjugated conductive polymer and a dopant is preferably 97 3 to 10 90 conjugated conductive polymer dopant . If the dopant content is over or under this range conductivity of the conjugated conductive polymer tends to decrease.

Examples of coating method of the conductive polymer solution include known methods such as coating immersion and spray and dried by a known technique such as hot air drying.

A capacitor is obtained by forming a cathode using known methods such as a method forming the solid electrolyte layer penetrating the electrolyte into the layer if necessary and forming a cathode conductive layer by applying carbon or silver paste and a method providing the cathode conductive layer such as aluminum foil via a separator.

When a separator is used the separator can be a single or mixed non woven fabric such as cellulose fiber glass fiber polypropylene fiber polyester fiber and polyamide fiber or carbide non woven fabrics prepared by carbonizing them

In the aforementioned method of producing a capacitor an electron donor compound is applied to the dielectric layer surface by which the electric affinity between the dielectric layer and the solid electrolyte layer is improved and therefore the impedance can be reduced. Moreover an electron donor compound is simply applied. Hence according to the aforementioned method of producing a capacitor a low impedance capacitor can be produced in a simple manner.

Furthermore capacitors produced by the aforementioned method have high electrostatic capacity and excellent heat resistance.

The capacitor having an electron donor compound layer of the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment. In the aforementioned embodiment an electron donor compound is applied to the dielectric layer surface a solid electrolyte layer is formed and then a conductive cathode layer is provided to form a cathode by which a capacitor is obtained. In the present invention the cathode conductive layer can be provided at any time. For example an electron donor compound is applied to the dielectric layer surface and a solid electrolyte layer is formed after a conductive cathode layer is provided in a manner in which it faces the dielectric layer. In such a case a separator is preferably provided between the cathode conductive layer and the dielectric layer.

The electron donor compound can be applied to the dielectric layer side surface of the cathode conductive layer and the separator beside the dielectric layer surface.

Another embodiment of the method of producing a capacitor comprising a step of applying a conductive polymer solution containing a conjugated conductive polymer a dopant a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound and a solvent to a surface of a dielectric layer of a capacitor intermediate comprising an anode composed of a porous material of valve metal and the dielectric layer formed by oxidizing a surface of the anode and forming a coating.

A conductive polymer solution is prepared by dissolving an anion group containing solubilizing polymer in a solvent that can dissolve the polymer adding precursor monomers for constituting the conductive polymer such as un substituted aniline or pyrrole or thiophene to the obtained solution adding oxidant to polymerize the monomers removing the extra oxidant and monomers for refining and adding a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound to obtain a conductive polymer solution.

Known oxidants can be used for polymerizing the conductive polymer including metal halogen compounds such as iron II chloride boron trifluoride and aluminum chloride peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide and benzoyl peroxide persulfates such as potassium persulfate sodium persufate and ammonium persulfate ozone and oxygen.

The conductive polymer solution can be applied by known methods such as coating immersion and spray and dried by known methods such as hot air drying.

After the solid electrolyte layer is formed the layer may be penetrated with the electrolyte if necessary. Then a cathode is formed by carbon or silver paste or a known technique such as providing a cathode electrode in the opposite position via a separator.

When a separator is used the separator can be a single or mixed non woven fabric such as cellulose fiber glass fiber polypropylene fiber polyester fiber and polyamide fiber or carbide non woven fabrics prepared by carbonizing them.

In the aforementioned method the conductive polymer solution is applied and dried to form a solid electrolyte layer. Therefore the process is simple and suitable for mass production and realizes low cost. Containing a conjugated conductive polymer a dopant and a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound the conductive polymer solution provides a highly conductive solid electrolyte layer.

The solid electrolyte layer can be formed by chemical oxidative polymerization or electrolytic polymerization where a simple and low cost process is not emphasized.

In the chemical oxidative polymerization a solution of precursor monomers for constituting a conjugated conductive polymer such as substituted or un substituted aniline or pyrrole or thiophene and an oxidant solution are prepared. A capacitor intermediate is alternately immersed in these solutions to form the conductive polymer on the dielectric layer surface of the capacitor. The same oxidant can be used.

The dopant and nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound can be simultaneously dissolved in the monomer solution or in the oxidant solution. Alternatively a solution of the dopant and nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound in a solvent is allowed to soak into the conjugated conductive polymer after the conjugated conductive polymer is formed.

In the electrolytic polymerization precursor monomers for constituting a conjugated conductive polymer such as un substituted aniline pyrrole or thiophene are introduced in a solvent such as acetonitrile. A capacitor intermediate having a conductive layer formed on the surface is introduced in an electrolytic bath where dopant is added as electrolyte. A higher voltage than the oxidation potential of the precursor monomers is applied for polymerization thereby a conjugated conductive polymer is formed on the dielectric layer of the capacitor intermediate.

The nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound can be dissolved in the electrolytic bath. Alternatively a solution of the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound in a solvent can be allowed to soak into the conjugated conductive polymer after the conductive polymer is formed.

When the solid electrolyte layer is formed by application of a conductive polymer solution or chemical oxidative polymerization since the conjugated conductive polymer has a large particle size the conjugated conductive polymer cannot reach deep inside the fine gaps on the dielectric layer surface of the capacitor intermediate making it difficult to derive electrostatic capacity. It is preferred that the cathode has electrolyte and the electrolyte is allowed to soak into the dielectric layer so as to complement the electrostatic capacity.

When the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound has a cross linkable functional group it is preferred that the coating is subject to heating and or UV irradiation after it is formed by applying a conductive polymer solution. Either one or both of heating and UV irradiation are selected according to the type of the cross linkable functional group.

Heating can be done by a conventional technique such as hot air heating and infrared heating. UV irradiation can be done by using a light source such as super high pressure mercury lamp high pressure mercury lamp low pressure mercury lamp carbon arc xenon arc and metal halide lamp.

The electrolyte is not limited as long as it has a high electric conductivity. It can be a known electrolyte dissolved in a known solvent.

Examples of the solvent include water alcohol solvents such as ethylene glycol diethylene glycol propylene glycol 1 4 butanediol and glycerin lactone solvents such as butyrolactone valerolactone and valerolactone amide solvents such as N methylformamide N N dimethylformamide N methylacetamide and N methylpyrrolidinone and nitrile solvents such as acetonitrile and 3 methoxypropionitrile.

Examples of the electrolyte include as anion components adipic acid glutaric acid succinic acid benzoic acid isophthalic acid phthalic acid terephthalic acid maleic acid toluic acid enanthic acid malonic acid and formic acid decandicarboxylic acid such as 1 6 decanedicarboxylic acid and 5 6 decanedicarboxylic acid octanedicarboxylic acids such as 1 7 octanedicarboxylic acid organic acids such as azelaic acid and sebacic acid or coral coral polyalcohol complex compounds obtained from coral and polyalcohol and inorganic acids such as phosphoric acid carbonic acid and silicic acid and as cation components primary amine methylamine ethylamine propylamine butylamine ethyleneamine secondary amine dimethylamine diethylamine dipropylamine methylethylamine diphenylamine and tertiary amine trimethylamine triethylamine tripropylamine triphenylamine 1 8 diazacyclo 5 4 0 undecene 7 tetraalkylammmonium tetramethylammonium tetraethylaammonium tetrapropylammonium tetrabutylammonium methyltriethylammonium dimethyldiethylammonium .

Embodiments of the methods of producing an antistatic coating material an antistatic coating an antistatic film an optical film and an optical information recording medium are described below.

For producing an antistatic coating material first a solubilizing polymer is dissolved in a solvent than can dissolve the polymer. Precursor monomers of a conductive compound and where necessary a dopant are added and the mixture is well stirred.

An oxidant is added dropwise to the mixture to allow the polymerization thereby a composite material of the conductive compound and the solubilizing polymer is obtained. After removing the oxidant monomer residue and byproducts and refining the composite material is dissolved in an appropriate solvent. A nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound and where necessary a dopant a binder resin and a cross linkable compound are added to obtain an antistatic coating material.

A known oxidant can be used for polymerizing precursor monomers of a conductive polymer. Examples of the oxidant include metal halogen compounds such as iron II chloride boron trifluoride and aluminum chloride peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide and benzoyl peroxide persulfates such as potassium persulfate sodium persulfate and ammonium persulfate ozone and oxygen.

Refining technique is not particularly limited. For example reprecipitation and ultrafiltration can be used. Ultra filtration is preferred because it is simple. Ultra filtration is a technique wherein a solution is circulated on a porous ultrafiltration membrane allowing the liquid of the solution to permeate the membrane. In this technique there is a difference in pressure between the circulating solution side and the permeated solution side of the ultrafiltration membrane. Therefore the circulating solution partly penetrates into the permeated solution side to alleviate the pressure on the circulating solution side. Along with the penetration of the circulating solution some of the particles having a particle size smaller than the ultrafiltration membrane opening and dissolved ions moves to the permeated solution side thereby the particles and dissolved ions are removed. The ultrafiltration membrane used can selectively have a differential molecular weight of 1000 to 1000000 according to the particle sizes and ion types to be removed.

An antistatic coating is formed by applying the antistatic coating solution to a base. The antistatic coating solution can be applied by for example immersion comma coating spray coating roll coating or gravure printing. The base is not limited. Molded resins particularly resin films which are easily electro statically charged are preferred.

Heating can be done by a conventional technique such as hot air heating and infrared heating. Photo curing to form a coating can be done by UV irradiation using a light source such as super high pressure mercury lamp high pressure mercury lamp low pressure mercury lamp carbon arc xenon arc and metal halide lamp.

Containing a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound the antistatic coating has a remarkably high conductivity. Specifically the antistatic coating has an electric conductivity of approximately 10 to 2000 S cm when it contains a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound while the antistatic coating has an electric conductivity of approximately 0.001 to 100 S cm when it does not contain a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound. Therefore higher conductivity is obtained even though it is itself a conductive polymer.

When the antistatic coating material contains a nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound the nitrogen containing aromatic cyclic compound is cross linked by heating or UV irradiation. The antistatic coating is densely interconnected consequently being not only highly conductive but also more heat resistant and thermally stable.

When an antistatic coating is used in optical applications particularly in optical filters and optical information recording media described later it is preferred that the antistatic coating be highly transparent. Specifically the antistatic coating preferably has a total light transmittance JIS Z 8701 of 85 or higher more preferably 90 or higher most preferably 96 or higher. The antistatic coating preferably has a haze JIS K 6714 of 5 or lower preferably 3 or lower most preferably 1 or lower.

When the antistatic coating also serves as a hard coat layer the antistatic coating preferably has a surface hardness pensile hardness of HB or harder.

The surface resistance of the antistatic coating is preferably adjusted as appropriate in view of optical properties. Generally approximately 1 10 to 1 10 is preferable for antistatic use.

The total light transmittance haze and surface resistance of a coating can be adjusted by the thickness of the antistatic coating. It is preferred to exclude binder resins where a lower surface resistance is required. However it is preferred to contain binder resins where low cost and better adhesion to a base are required.

An antistatic film comprises a base film and the aforementioned antistatic coating on at least one side of the base film.

Examples of the base film include low density polyethylene film high density polyethylene film ethylene propylene copolymer film polypropylene film ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer film ethylene methylmethacrylate copolymer film polyethyleneterephthalate PET film polybutyleneterephthalate PBT film polyethylenenaphthalate PEN film polyimide film 6 nylon film 6 6 nylon film polymethylmethacrylate film polystyrene film styrene acrylonitrile butadiene copolymer film polyacrylonitrile film cellulose triacetate TAC film cellulose propionate film polyvinyl chloride film polyvinylidene chloride film polyvinylidene fluoride film polyethylene tetrafluoride film polyvinyl alcohol coating film ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer film polycarbonate film polysulfone film polyethersulfone film polyetherether ketone film and polyphenyleneoxide film.

These base films generally have lipophilic surfaces. Therefore it is difficult to apply an antistatic coating dissolved in an aqueous solvent. Then when an antistatic coating material dissolved in an aqueous solvent is used it is preferred that the base film surface be treated by for example etching such as sputtering corona discharge blazing UV irradiation electron irradiation chemical conversion and oxidation or base coating for hydrophilicity. Furthermore solvent cleaning or ultrasonic cleaning may be performed for ducting and cleanup where necessary.

In order to attach the optical filter to the display screen of a display apparatus a transparent adhesive layer is provided on the surface of the film base of the optical filter and the optical filter is attached via this adhesive layer.

Any type of transparent plastic films can be used as the film base . Examples of transparent plastic films include those made of polyethylene terephthalate polyimide polyethersulfone polyetheretherketone polycarbonate polypropylene polyamide acrylamide cellulose and propionate.

It is preferred that the film base has a surface treated by for example etching such as sputtering corona discharge blazing UV irradiation electron irradiation chemical conversion and oxidation or primary coating. With the surface being thus treated the film base has better adhesion to the antistatic coating .

The surface of the film base can be cleaned by solvent cleaning or ultrasonic cleaning for ducting and cleanup where necessary before the antistatic coating is attached.

The antistatic coating is a coating made of an antistatic coating material as described above and also serves as a hard coat layer. Therefore as mentioned above it is preferred that the antistatic coating has a surface hardness pencil hardness of HB or harder. Further because of optical use the antistatic coating preferably has a total light transmittance JIS Z 8701 of 85 or higher more preferably 90 or higher most preferably 96 or higher. The antistatic coating preferably has a haze JIS K 6714 of 5 or lower preferably 3 or lower and most preferably 1 or lower.

The anti reflection layer prevents light reflection. This layer can be a monolayer or a multilayer. When it is a monolayer it is preferred that the anti reflection layer has a refractive index of 1.38 to 1.45 and an optical film thickness of 80 to 100 nm.

The anti reflection layer can be formed by a dry or wet method. Examples of the dry method include physical vapor deposition such as electron beam deposition dielectric heating deposition resistance heating deposition sputtering and ion plating and plasma CVD. When it is formed by a dry method the anti reflection layer can contain inorganic compound components such as silicon oxide magnesium oxide niobium oxide titanium oxide tantalum oxide aluminum oxide zirconium oxide indium oxide and tin oxide.

In the wet method a coating material containing a curable compound is applied by a known technique such as comma coating spray coating roll coating and gravure printing and then cured. Usable curable compounds for forming the anti reflection layer by a wet method include fluorine containing compounds such as fluorine containing organic compounds fluorine containing organic silicon compounds and fluorine containing inorganic compounds.

The optical filter can further comprise an anti fouling layer on the anti reflection layer . The anti fouling layer serves to prevent dust and stain and make cleaning easy when it gets dirt.

The anti fouling layer is not particularly limited as long as it does not interfere with the anti reflection function of the anti reflection layer and is highly water repellent and oil repellent. It can be an organic compound layer or an inorganic compound layer. The anti fouling layer can be for example a layer containing an organic silicon compound having a perfluorosilane or fluorocycloalkyl group or a fluorine organic compound.

The anti fouling layer can be formed by a techniques selected according to its type including physical vapor phase deposition method or chemical vapor phase deposition method such as vapor deposition sputtering and ion plating vacuum process such as plasma polymerization micro gravure screen coating and dip coating.

The aforementioned optical filter has the antistatic coating for protecting the film base . The antistatic coating is made of the aforementioned antistatic coating material being highly transparent and showing good adhesion to the film base . The optical filter has a stable antistatic property which keeps dust away from it.

The optical filter as described above can be preferably used in anti reflection films for liquid crystal displays and plasma displays infrared absorptive films and electromagnetic wave absorptive films.

The optical filter of the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment as long as it has an antistatic coating made of the aforementioned antistatic coating material. For example the film base can be replaced with a polarizing plate. The polarizing plate can be a laminate of a polyvinyl alcohol resin film in which a dichromatic colorant is absorbed and oriented and a protective film s on one or both sides of the film. Iodine or a dichromatic dye can be used as the dichromatic colorant. Such a filter can be provided to the most front surface of a liquid crystal display.

An embodiment of the optical information recording medium of the present invention is described below.

The first and second dielectric layers and can be made of inorganic materials such as SiN. SiO SiO and TaO.

These dielectric layers can be formed to a thickness of 10 to 500 nm by a known technique such as vacuum deposition sputtering and ion plating.

The optical information recording layer can be made of for example inorganic photomagnetic recording materials such as Tb Fe Th Fe Co Dy Fe Co and Th Dy Fe Co inorganic phase conversion recording materials such as TeOx Te Ge Sn Te Ge Bi Te Ge Sb Te Ge Pb Sn Te and Tl In Se and organic dyes such as cyanine dye polymethine dye phthalocyanine dye merocyanine dye azulene dye and squalium dye.

When it is made of an inorganic material the optical information recording medium can be formed to a thickness of 10 to 999 nm by a known technique such as vacuum deposition sputtering and ion plating. When it is made of an organic dye the optical information recording medium can be formed by applying a solution of the organic dye in a solvent such as acetone diacetone alcohol ethanol and methanol using a known printing or application technique to a thickness of 10 to 999 nm.

The metal reflection layer reflects light. It is made of metals such as Al Cr Ni Ag and Au and their oxides and nitrides. They can be used individually or in combination of two or more. The metal reflection layer is formed by sputtering or vacuum deposition to a thickness of 2 to 200 nm.

The antistatic coating is made of the aforementioned antistatic coating material. Having a surface hardness of HB or harder the antistatic coating serves to protect the surface of the optical information recording medium from being damaged to protect the metal reflection layer from being oxidized and to prevent adhesion of dust caused by static electricity.

The antistatic coating preferably has a thickness of 3 to 15 m. When the thickness is smaller than 3 m it is often difficult to form a uniform coating thereby the antistatic coating may fail to provide sufficient antistatic or damage resistant property or antioxidation effect on the metal reflection layer . When the thickness is larger than 15 m the inner stress is increased. Therefore the optical information recording medium may have deteriorated mechanical properties.

The antistatic coating can be formed by applying the antistatic coating material to the metal reflection layer using a known technique such as comma coating spray coating roll coating and gravure printing which is followed by drying the solvent or heat or UV curing.

The aforementioned optical information recording medium has the antistatic coating that serves to protect the optical information recording layer and metal reflection layer . The antistatic coating is made of the aforementioned antistatic coating material. Therefore the antistatic coating has a small haze and a high light transmittance being highly transparent at reading laser wavelengths of 780 and 635 nm. With its antistatic property the antistatic coating serves to control dust adhesion caused by static electricity and therefore prevent reading and writing errors.

The optical information recording medium of the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment. For example it can be a recordable disc. The recordable disc comprises for example a transparent resin base organic material an optical information recording layer a reflection metal layer and an antistatic coating which are formed in sequence.
