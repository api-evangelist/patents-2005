The new and distinct cultivar Going Bananas hereinafter also referred to as Going Bananas and the plant is a new and distinct plant. It was hybridized by Chris Meyer in the summer of 1992 and discovered as first flowered in 1994 as part of an on going hybridizing program to develop new and improved cultivars. The plant was found growing in trial fields of a nursery in Zeeland Mich. USA. The plant has been successfully propagated by division methods at the same nursery to produce identical plants that maintain the unique characteristics of the original plant.

The genus is mainly native to central Europe China and Japan with approximately 15 species. It is now highly hybridized with over 60 000 registered named cultivars. Going Bananas is unique from all forms known to the applicant in the following characteristics

In comparison Going Bananas is a slightly larger plant overall has larger flowers and tepals with lighter yellow coloring to the front more green on the back and more creping on the inner tepals and it does not stop flowering in August as Happy Returns frequently does.
