title: Compile-time dispatch of operations on type-safe heterogeneous containers
abstract: Implementing a type-safe heterogeneous containers in a memory arrangement of a computing system. In one embodiment, a main object of a class is specified in program source code. The class has a variant type, and the variant type provides at least two different data types, at least one of which is a linear array of objects of one of the data types. The class includes methods for putting and getting a variant object of the variant type in and from the main object. An application of a visitor method, which includes a respective operator for each of the different data types, is specified in the program source code for each method for getting a variant object from the main object. Compilation of the source code results in code that executes the one of the operators corresponding to the data type of a referenced variant object of the main object.
