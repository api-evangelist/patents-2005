title: Methods and apparatuses for navigation in urban environments
abstract: Embodiments disclose methods, systems, and apparatuses for providing maps and directions, including walking and mass transit directions in urban environments where users do not drive cars. Additionally, driving directions can be included. Various criteria, including preferences for amount of walking, for or against particular streets, certain mass transit vehicle types, number of transfers between mass transit vehicles, and other preferences, are considered in the routing calculations, as well as non-individual information such as current conditions and other information. User feedback on various qualitative aspects of the directions is received and stored, and used in subsequent routing decisions. Embodiments disclosed include web services whereby third parties, such as members of the travel industry, can access such services which provide textual and graphical information. Further, clients can access and edit mass transit information through the web services.

The invention relates to automated assistance in finding maps and routes in urban areas often without an automobile involving walking mass transit and other transportation modes.

The invention provides methods and apparatuses for assisting users in journey planning within urban areas especially without the use of an automobile. A fully integrated system of walking mass transit and driving directions is provided taking into account time of day and day of week user preferences for amount of walking number of mass transit transfers and other factors current congestion data and user feedback on qualitative and quantitative measures of transportation such as best subway lines average walk times on particular streets or most scenic streets.

HTTP for HyperText Transfer Protocol is the primary method used to convey information on the World Wide Web.

A Uniform Resource Locator URL or Web address is a standardized address for some resource such as a document or image on the Internet or elsewhere. First created by Tim Berners Lee for use on the World Wide Web the currently used forms are detailed by Internet standard RFC 1738.

An HTTP cookie usually called simply a cookie is a packet of information sent by a server to a World Wide Web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses that server. Cookies are used by a server to maintain state between otherwise stateless HTTP transactions and are often used for authentication personalization shopping baskets and other information about the user accessing the server.

Automated navigation systems are known in the art. Bellesfield et al U.S. Pat. No. 6 282 489 for instance discloses methods and apparatus for displaying a travel route and generating a list of places of interest located near the travel route. Rafiah et al U.S. Pat. No. 6 834 229 discloses a journey planner providing an integrated travel plan involving multiple transportation modes including driving and public transportation. Many other systems providing road directions e.g. Mapquest on the Internet are available.

Such systems are commonly limited to providing road directions which may be useful for either driving or walking. Rafiah mentioned above accesses the online databases of various transport providers e.g. trains buses ferries airlines subways and others creating a menu of options for longer trips such as city to city but ignores many of the problems of urban travel as will be shown below.

Finally there are many GPS enabled devices which can assist in finding a route over terrain with or without roads. However the micro environment of an urban area presents additional and hitherto unaddressed problems.

In an urban environment users are presented with a different set of issues than have been addressed by such navigation systems.

In New York for example people frequently do not own cars or at least do not drive them for daily use since it is costly slow and inconvenient and parking is scarce and expensive. Public transportation particularly buses subways and ferries on the other hand is readily available and routes are well integrated so that a substantial number of Manhattan residents do not even own a car.

Yet there is a vast amount of knowledge about the various bus and subway lines which residents and visitors must master in order to use the system efficiently. For example the NYC Transit system has 468 subway stations. The 25 subway routes are interconnected and many lines feature express trains across the platform transfers to local trains and skip stop express service. Moreover certain trains operate on different frequencies and stop on different subway stations based on the time of day and day of the week. Often newcomers tourists and other visitors simply walk or use taxis because they don t know where the buses and subways run or how often where to board them how to pay for them whether exact change is required stored value fare cards etc. or where to exit. The uncertainty is simply too great for someone unfamiliar with the system.

Moreover walking is a vitally important transportation option in Manhattan and other urban areas. Not only is it sometimes the most efficient method for short distances it is often preferable because of the exercise benefits access to shopping and other urban services enjoyment of pleasant weather etc. Yet walking can also be problematic especially for newcomers but even for natives. In cities comprised of a large network of streets city residents and tourists are often confused by the complex maze of connecting street walkways. Some of these streets are also only available to vehicles or are un passable on foot. In addition consumers require clear walking directions to the appropriate location to enter a subway station or bus stop. There is a need for point to point routing information including walking direction in addition to other transportation options.

An end to end journey an automobile in Manhattan Boston Washington or other city with well developed rapid transit thus requires assembling information from a diverse set of sources not as yet well integrated or Web enabled. There is thus a need in the art for systems and methods for assisting navigation in an urban environment especially without a car.

The invention provides a range of services related to navigation in urban areas. Routes from a start point to an end point and optionally passing through one or more intermediate points can be created taking into account user criteria. Current information such as mass transit conditions and walking conditions as defined earlier in this document can be factored into the routing decisions. Users can access the services from standard computers hand held digital devices such as PDAs including via SMS short message service messages voice recognition interface or via a Web Service or ordinary HTTP access.

In one embodiment a user enters a start and destination address into a web page preferences for amount of walking transportation mode subways buses walking or combinations thereof tolerance for transfers among mass transit vehicles maximum number of buses taken users may not want to take 3 successive buses even if it is the optimal route by some calculations max number of subway trains date and time of departure etc. In other embodiments users can provide feedback indicating preferences for or against certain streets for walking because of shopping desirability or crime undesirability or against certain mass transit routes e.g. because of past mechanical problem chronic lateness crowded cars etc. . Feedback can be used either for individual routing decisions or in one embodiment as current information on mass transit conditions walking conditions or driving conditions which influences routing decisions for one or more other users as well. In still other embodiments routing can be conditioned based on time of day or day of week certain streets may be deserted at night and thus dangerous or on the weather walking is less preferable when it s raining or based on special events a visit by the President may upset all transit schedules in the immediate neighborhood .

In embodiments of the invention users provide feedback which is used to continuously enhance the quality of the invention. Feedback is used both to create and maintain a database about the user s own preferences which is useful for creating routes for that user and also to update the database used for all users. For example a user may report a preference for walking on a particular street because she has friends there and may also report that a subway stop has broken turnstiles and is dirty and unpleasant. The former information is used only in the context of creating a route for that user while the latter is applicable to all users.

In addition to adjusting the database based on reported times conditions and preferences the invention in another embodiment acts as a social network or virtual community .

User comments in some cases contain more detail than can be captured in a rating system or in average speed data. Therefore comments are also made available in an unmediated searchable format

Additionally a Web Service is provided for transit operators and other third parties in order that mass transit information can be viewed entered and edited saving the operators the burden of hosting and maintaining a web presence. The route information can be accessed from an Internet enabled computer via text messaging services such as SMS short message service on a mobile computing device such as PDA or cell phone or by voice over a normal cell phone. A Web Service is provided for programmatic use as well as a standard HTTP server for human mediated use.

The Links table is a table of transportation links walking rapid transit etc. For each link such information as the id x y coordinates of the start and stop points the distance the name of the link start and stop ids vehicle id and other information is stored. Its source for walking links can be a publicly available geographical database such as TIGER Line data from the U.S. Census Bureau or a commercial digital map provider such as Navteq www.navteq.com or Tele Atlas www.teleatlas.com or others. Its source for rapid transit links is the Routes table .

The Routes table is a table of rapid transit routes. There is no single universal source of online rapid transit information in some cities and an aspect of the invention is a method of creating and providing such a source. The Routes table contains an id name description vehicle type schedule information on when the route is traversed information on when the data was entered and by whom it was approved etc.

The Stops table is a table of rapid transit stops containing for each stop its id address x y coordinates name description information on when the data was entered and by whom it was approved etc.

The Route items table is a relational table providing a correspondence between and symbolized by the Rel  symbol. There is one row for each stop of each route the row containing the id of the route and the id of the stop.

The Routes table is created by hand in one embodiment of the invention meaning that the data is inputted by administrative personnel of the publisher operating the invention or by personnel of the various rapid transit agencies as described later under

At for each pair i i 1 of the stops array a node in the route layer of the directed graph with the same x y coordinates is looked up and if not found created. The algorithm continues on . At a test is made as to whether the algorithm has already processed a route node whose x.y coordinates are the same as those of the from node. If so at the from node is assigned the node number of that node if not at a new node number is assigned it. A similar test is made for the to node at where if a route node has been processed whose x.y coordinates are the same as those of the to node if so assigns that node number to the to node if not at a new node number is assigned. At a new record is inserted into the Links table.

At the start and destination addresses are validated. At the x y coordinates of the start and destination addresses are looked up using any suitable software for resolving a building or intersection address in one embodiment a publicly available sofware package Geocoder described at http www.cpan.org modules by module Geo Geo Coder US 1.00.readme and spell checker software for checking the spelling of geographic names and offering corrections such as that offered by Aspell http aspell.net . is continued at .

Although classical route finding algorithms such as Dijkstra s find the least cost route based on some cost factor the algorithm has been extended in novel ways for the invention. illustrates where the hypothetical task is to find the least cost route from A at to B at .

According to Dijkstra s algorithm nodes are found closest to the start node node A at one by one. First consider nodes C at and D at . The closest to A is node C because the distance of edge link A C at is 10 seconds and A D at is 20 seconds. Thus the first closest node is found node A at . This is called a resolved node. Then consider nodes that are connected with one edge to the resolved nodes. Compare distances from node A at to such nodes. Thus compare distances from A at to D at the distance along edge is 20 seconds and from A at to F at the distance is 50 seconds 10 40 . Thus the second closest node is node D at . Repeat finding the next closest node until node B at is reached the destination node . Going back from B to A using the closest nodes we find the shortest path from A to B.

Each edge of the graph is a record in the Links table. When the next closest node is searched for and an edge a link is considered the link is filtered in the following manner 

If the link is a part of a route and the vehicle of the route is excluded by the user based on any mass transit criteria e.g. the user has excluded all buses or B25 bus only the link is skipped as if it doesn t exist in the graph at all.

If the path to the last closest node contains the maximum number of buses taken according to another mass transit criteria and the link belongs to a bus route the link is skipped. The same applies to the mass transit criteria of maximum number of subway trains.

If the walking distance of the path to the last closest node is equal or greater than a walking criteria of maximum distance walked and the link is a walking link the link is skipped.

If the link is not available currently because of known mass transit conditions where currently is approximately the departure time selected by the user plus the distance to the last closest node in seconds the link is skipped.

It will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the filtering of links can be extended to include any of the criteria mentioned earlier such as mass transit or walking conditions user preferences etc. or other criteria. Additionally the cost factors shown in could be adjusted on a continuous basis so that expected mass transit or walking delays are real time or nearly so.

While thus far embodiments of the invention have been described as for non driving transportation in urban environments in other embodiments it can include driving as one or more legs of a trip. For example a route can include driving to a train station or Park And Ride parking taking one or more trains or other mass transit vehicles and then walking to the final destination. Or in other embodiments inter city trips can be handled and the route can include driving to an airport dropping off a rental car flying to another city and taking public transportation from the airport as in cities such as New York Boston San Francisco and Chicago where subway trains serve the airports.

The algorithm continues at on where the ImpossibleTurns table is created a table giving a list of driving link pairs which are not driveable either at certain times on certain days or at all. is expanded on . At all records are deleted. At a test is made as to whether all D for driving records of the Links table have been processed. If so the algorithm terminates. If not a pair of D records is read . At a test is made as to whether the pair are connected i.e. if the second node of the second link is the same as the first node of the first link. If not the algorithm returns to . If so a test is made at as to whether driving through from link to link is possible. Note that since the TIGER Line data from the U.S. Census Bureau does not contain full information on driving conditions such as legal turns other databases from commercial sources such as Navteq http www.navteq.com are used in some embodiments of the invention. If so the algorithm returns to . If not at a record is added to the ImpossibleTurns table.

The algorithm continues at on which is expanded on . On the ovals represent nodes and the directed lines represent links. is a link representing a one way street while and represent a two way street. The absence of a link in the opposite direction from indicates that travel is not possible in that direction. and also represent one way links but additionally an entry in the database for notes that the right turn is prohibited. The algorithm continues at on which represents the normal processing of the route daemon for driving directions. When considering any link for inclusion in driving directions the daemon checks the previous link in the Links table and if the pair consisting of the previous link and the link being considered exists as a row in the ImpossibleTurns table the link is removed from consideration for incorporation into the route.

On a portion of the database schema is shown. describes the Feedback table data for which is derived from the user interface control . The route id and stop id fields pertain to a mass transit line or mass transit stop respectively while the tlid field pertains to a portion of a walking route. ip represents user identification information in this embodiment the IP address from which the feedback was received. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that other forms of user identification information could also be used e.g. a unique id of the user as determined by table lookup telephone number index into a table of email addresses personal name social security number etc. The c time field represents the current time of the receipt of the user feedback.

The Feedback table is searched for lines stops or streets having more than 5 Feedback records from different users within the last 6 months. Other parameters for the frequency and recency of the feedback could also be used. In addition other methods of testing recency could be used e.g. weighted averages. An average rating is calculated.

If a mass transit route is found with the desired frequency and recency of feedback all links of the route are penalized by having the stored distance of the link multiplied by a factor in one embodiment 10 divided by the average rating. A sufficiently large increase will thus tend to bias the routing algorithm away from the mass transit route.

If a mass transit stop is found with the desired frequency and recency of feedback all links that lead to this stop are penalized by having the stored distance of the link multiplied by a factor in one embodiment 10 divided by the average rating. A sufficiently large increase will thus tend to bias the routing algorithm away from the mass transit route.

If a portion of a street is found with the desired frequency and recency of feedback the stored distance of the street portion multiplied by a factor in one embodiment 10 divided by the average rating. A sufficiently large increase will thus tend to bias the routing algorithm away from the street portion.

The foregoing have described an embodiment of the invention which can be delivered over the web to the general public possibly for free. In another embodiment the invention can be offered on a subscription or fee basis to transit operators hotels travel agents tourist bureaus whether public or private corporate trip planners or any members of the travel industry. The invention can be offered as a Web Service as defined earlier with a license key provided in each transaction.

A client wishing to gain access to the invention via the Web Service must enter into a contractual arrangement possibly through an agent with the publisher of the Web Service. The publisher might offer a variety of plans such as a limit on the number of transactions per month year or other period perhaps with rollover for unused transactions as in cell phone plans. There could be a per transaction fee if the client exceeds the limit in any given period. There might also be a fixed fee for unlimited access or reciprocal arrangements wherein the client performs other services for the operator such as advertising or contribution to the upkeep of the server installation.
