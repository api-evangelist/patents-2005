This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 574 458 filed 26 May 2005.

The present invention was made with government support by the National Science Foundation NSF through NSF EEC 9402723. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention is generally related to lead free bonding systems and more specifically related to a solution derived lead free bonding interface with thin film and powder processing for bonding chip to package interconnects for nano wafer level packaging.

The National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative NEMI has endorsed Sn Ag Cu as the lead free solder standard for the electronics industry. New solder materials have been reported by microalloying of grain refining elements into Sn Ag and Sn Cu Ag systems to achieve better mechanical properties. 1 3 . These materials are generally made by co milling of different powders. Milling of materials such as Sn Ag and Sn Ag Cu does not control particle size impurities composition and homogenity.

Another method used to deposit lead free solder films is electroplating. Unfortunately electroplating does not control the composition accurately and is not widely demonstrated to achieve ternary compositions.

Therefore it can be seen that a need exists for a solder deposition process that can control the composition accurately as well as be free from any impurities which is inherent in processes such as milling. The invention described herein can serve as an excellent bonding technology for bonding chip to package interconnects.

These interconnects can provide improved electrical performance while lowering the stresses at the interfaces by orders of magnitude. It is to such a structure being a high aspect ratio metal coated polymer structure that the present invention is primarily directed. This technology when used in conjunction with polymer based structures can also simplify the processing steps and result in tremendous cost reductions.

Briefly described in a preferred form the present invention provides alternate approaches to achieve compositions with required stoichiometry into the alloy system both in thin film and powder form. Two solution derived approaches include sol gel and electroless plating and both have been demonstrated to achieve these nano dimensional interfaces.

The sol gel approach can achieve nano grained films with easy incorporation of suitable additives to improve the mechanical properties. The electroless plating approach can selectively deposit thin films of metals and alloys at less than 50 C. temperature and is hence another attractive processing route for nano solder based reworkable bond interfaces.

The present invention can be used for pushing the limits of current flip chip bonding in terms of pitch number of I Os superior combination of electrical and mechanical properties as well as reworkability. A number of other advantages are gained from using the present innovations. Chip to package interconnect length is minimized thereby reducing the electrical parasitics considerably. Also a high bandwidth between chips can be achieved because of the large number of area array I O connections at extremely fine pitches. While current assembly equipment may not be suitable for placement and alignment the present invention will stimulate new innovations in advanced equipment and self assembly processes.

Solution derived nano solder technology is an attractive low cost method for several applications such as MEMS hermetic packaging compliant interconnect bonding and bumpless nano interconnects. These bonding interfaces convert to liquid around 220 270 C and are therefore reworkable.

In a preferred embodiment the present invention is a novel method to synthesize lead free solder using a sol gel process. The invention can include the step of depositing the solder films using process including a spin coating process dip coating curtain coating and meniscus coating.

Reduction of the sol derived oxides can be used to get the lead free solders and is preferably performed in a hydrogen or other reducing gas environment. This step of reduction is preferably run at approximately between 200 C. 500 C. The invention can include reducing the reduction temperature by controlling the hydrolysis of the sol.

In another preferred embodiment the present invention is a novel powder synthesis of lead free solders with accurate binary tertiary or higher compositions. It can also include the synthesis of exact stoichiometric compositions using the sol gel process by mixing the right amount of precursors.

In yet another preferred embodiment the invention can be a novel method to synthesize lead free solder using a solution reduction process and further using the solution reduction process at temperatures approximately between 25 C. 45 C.

Further described is a way to modify the bath salt ion compositions to tune the plated solder film composition and a bonding assembly system of a chip to a substrate with the above lead free solder interfaces for electrical and mechanical connections.

The lead free solders of the present invention can be used as interfaces for hermetic sealing MEMS microfluidic packages. The solution reduction processes can be used to selectively coat on metal pads.

Additives such as Zr V Nb titania alumina or other pinning agents can be incorporated through the sol gel process to improve the creep properties of the solder. Such additives can also improve the strength and the fatigue resistance.

These and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading the following specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

IC packaging is one of the key enabling technologies for microprocessor performance. As performance increases the technical challenges increase in the areas of power delivery heat removal I O density and thermo mechanical reliability.

These are the most difficult challenges for improving performance and increasing integration along with decreasing manufacturing cost.

Decreasing I O pitch is one of the key technological barriers identified by the 2003 International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors ITRS 1 . See Table 1. The present invention goes beyond the ITRS roadmap in terms of 1 Signal and power integrity 2 I O connections and 3 Reworkability. Therefore the scope of the present invention is not limited by the ITRS roadmap but goes beyond it by way of a disruptive approach to IC packaging.

Downscaling the traditional solder bump interconnect will not satisfy the thermo mechanical reliability requirements at very fine pitches of the order of 30 m and less. Alternate interconnection approaches such as compliant interconnects typically require lengthy connections and are therefore limited in terms of electrical properties although expected to meet the mechanical requirements.

A combination of decreasing pitch environmental concerns Pb Halogen free mechanical stress concerns electrical requirements e.g. current density and cost constraints will drive the development of interconnect materials processes and designs in entirely new directions. A new paradigm is therefore necessary for cost performance and reliability of IC package interconnections. This can be achieved by defining and exploring solutions beyond solder bumps and compliant interconnects by way of interconnect innovations combined with new designs novel and reworkable assembly technologies.

The next generation IC package interconnect requires a technology that is low cost reworkable possess good electrical properties good reliability and should be easily testable at the wafer level with good co planarity. To achieve the requirements of very fine pitch as projected by ITRS with conventional interconnects and materials one has to accept a trade off in electrical and mechanical performance and possibly cost. This trade off between electrical and mechanical performance is analyzed with thermo mechanical and electrical modeling as detailed hereinafter.

The present invention proposes reworkable nano interconnections as a new interconnect paradigm for potential low cost highest performance and reliability not trading one for the other. This approach also addresses reworkability that technologies such as chips first fail to address.

In this approach high speed comes from the smallest interconnects with the best electrical properties. The mechanical integrity and reliability come from the improved mechanical properties of materials at nano scale. Low cost comes from thin film or self assembly deposition of nano structures on the entire 300 mm wafer. Nano scale interconnects can offer these benefits as well as lower the pitch along with improved electrical and mechanical performance to accommodate future system demands thus realizing the goal of unlimited I Os.

Reworkability is needed to be able to replace bad chips with good chips particularly with MCM SIP or SOP approaches. The present invention proposes thin liquid interfaces to accomplish this on the package side.

Nano wafer level packaging of ICs is expected to be cost effective since nano scale connections are deposited on the entire 300 mm wafer with thousands and possibly millions of connections. These connections are also expected to be used to test and burn in at the wafer level and at high speed. These connections are proposed to be integrated with the back end fabrication with Copper low K process technology.

The nano interconnections appear to illustrate for the first time that neither of the above may be necessary. Applicants realize however that higher temperature boards with higher modulus may be highly desirable for fine line lithographic reasons and these type of boards invariably tend to be lower in CTE. Nano interconnects can be therefore be realized easily with lower CTE 2 4 ppm boards leading to symmetrical structures on both sides of the joint as is shown in . 2 illustrates the present concept of nano interconnects with mechanically symmetric high density packaging.

The interconnect signal delay between the IC and the package depends strongly on the interconnect material used. Materials with lowest resistivity that are processable and manufacturable and yet maintain nano scale structures and properties at assembly and operating temperatures become a logical choice for the interconnect system.

Copper and other high temperature materials are herein selected as the interconnect materials but the focus is on copper as the interconnect material. Nano structured copper shows significant improvements in fracture strength and toughness 5 that can address the reliability concerns with fine pitch interconnects. The advantage of copper as a good electrical conductor is undisputed. Conductivity of pure copper is 5.96 10Ohmmas compared to a conductivity of 6.9 10Ohmmfor Pb Sn eutectic solders. In addition copper has good electro migration stability that renders high current carrying capability to the interconnects.

The present invention is directed to nano dimensional solder films as an efficient way to achieve reworkable interfaces with lowest electrical parasitics. The National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative NEMI has endorsed Sn Ag Cu as the lead free solder standard for the electronics industry and hence Sn Ag Cu and Sn Ag alloys have been selected herein to function as a reworkable bonding interface between the interconnect and the package.

Three approaches sol gel electroless plating and cosputtering have been demonstrated to achieve such nano dimensional interfaces. The sol gel approach can achieve nano grained films with easy incorporation of suitable additives to improve the mechanical properties. Electroless plating can selectively deposit thin films of metals and alloys at less than 50 C. temperature and is hence another attractive processing route for nano solder based reworkable bond interfaces.

Between the two material systems copper is advantageous due to high yield strength compared to lead free solders. On the other hand use of lead free solder makes the package reworkable since it is possible to take off bad chips and replace them with good chips.

Applicants utilized two main technologies sol gel techniques and electroless plating to demonstrate thin reworkable interfaces. Sn Ag and Sn Cu are the two compositions that were demonstrated. Ternary alloys such as Sn Ag Cu may also be used for the bonding interfaces.

Synthesis of nano metals and nano alloys of specific size and morphology is a key aspect in the development of new materials. The solution sol gel SSG process is a highly versatile process that can lead to powders films fibers spheres monoliths aerogels and xerogels for example of high purity and homogeneity. It offers distinct advantages such as low processing temperature better control over stoichiometry and chemical homogeneity.

Purity of SSG derived materials can be controlled by the purity of the starting chemicals while homogeneity can be controlled by precisely controlling the hydrolysis condensation and polymerization reactions. The starting precursors in the SSG process can be metal organic compounds inorganic metal salts for example. The key however is to achieve ultra homogeneous mixing at atomic to molecular levels. Preparation of high purity ceramic powders via the SSG process has previously been reported 7 . Yet there appear to be no reports on the synthesis of lead free solders by solution sol gel SSG processing. One of the objectives of the present invention is to apply the strategy of atomic to molecular level mixing of the precursors and synthesize nano lead free solder materials by sol gel technology.

The experimental procedure adopted for the synthesis of SnAgCuby sol gel process is illustrated in . Tin II 2 ethylhexonate CH CH CH CH CO Sn Aldrich copper II ethoxide Cu OCH Alfa Aesar and silver nitrate AgNO Alfa Aesar were used in this process. Initially a stoichiometric amount of Tin II 2 ethylhexanoate was dissolved in 2 methoxyethanol 2 MOE as solvent in a flask and refluxed at 125 C. for 5 hours in nitrogen atmosphere. Subsequently copper II ethoxide was dissolved in 2 MOE in a separate flask and refluxed in nitrogen atmosphere at 125 C. for 5 hours. Both the Sn and Cu precursor solutions were cooled to room temperature.

Finally silver nitrate was dissolved in 2 MOE in a separate flask and refluxed at 125 C. for 5 hours. This silver precursor solution was cooled to room temperature and then added to the Sn Cu solution and refluxed at 125 C. for 5 hours to obtain a clear Sn Ag Cu precursor solution. A similar procedure was adopted for Sn Cu.

Reduction of Copper Sn Cu and Sn Ag Cu precursors was performed in a forming gas environment. Sn Ag Cu solders were formed at 400 C. while Sn Cu precursor was reduced at only a temperature of 500 C. Bare silicon wafers coated with Cr Au were spin coated with precursor solutions and then spin dried before being reduced in the forming gas environment in a tube furnace. The reduction time for these wafers was about 5 hours.

Rapid Thermal Processing RTP was also evaluated as a technique to get faster reduction of precursors into metallic films. In this case the RTP processing time was 5 minutes in a forming gas 3 H N flow of 5 SCCM at 600 C.

X Ray spectra using CuK radiation were measured on reduced alloy films. The spectra shown in were observed for the Sn Ag Cu films reduced at different temperatures. The sol for synthesizing lead free alloys was characterized with Thermal Gravimetric Analysis TGA before further processing. shows a sharp decrease in weight until 125 C. corresponding to solvent evaporation. It is seen that the pyrolytic decomposition of the precursor completes at around 450 C. and it can be lowered to 400 C. by increasing the pyrolysis time.

Both SnCuand SnAgCuwere synthesized from reduction in forming gas. For Sn Cu precursor no Sn peaks were evident at 400 C. even after the reduction was carried for seven hours in forming gas. The XRD peaks mostly correspond to crystalline SnOwith an amorphous background. The metallic system was formed above 500 C. in this case.

On the other hand Sn peaks were observed at 400 C. with the Sn Ag Cu precursor. It can be seen from the Ellingham diagram that Ag and Cu will be easily reduced as compared to tin. The presence of Ag and Cu also enabled easy reduction of tin oxide to tin at 400 C. that was not possible with Sn Cu precursor. The lowered thermodynamic activity of Sn in presence of Ag and Cu destabilized the tin oxide in Sn Ag Cu and enabled the reduction at lower temperatures.

A Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope was used to observe the morphology of Sn Ag Cu formed on a Cr Au coated silicon wafer. See . Since the film thickness is of the order of 100 nm nanoscale interfacial bonding can be achieved from reflow. and are micrographs of two silicon wafers bonded with such thin interfaces. The thickness of the bonding interface is 200 nm. The grains seen as specks in the film are of the order of 10 nm. The mechanical properties of these structures are expected to be far superior to conventional lead free solders.

For electroless plating of alloys the control of final alloy composition and incorporation of additives requires careful control of the plating bath selection of reducing agents and control over processing conditions. Unlike metal organic precursors used in the sol gel approach this approach uses soluble salts in which the metal ions would be reduced to the metal using reducing agents.

Metal nanoparticles are often formed directly in solution by reduction of metal salts. This is accomplished by using strong reducing agents such as alkali metals and alkali metal borohydrides. For example silver salts e.g. AgNO AgCl or gold salts e.g. HAuCl can be reduced by sodium borohydride to form silver or gold nanoparticles. For some metals such as Ag Au and Pt for example weaker reducing agents alcohols DMF ethylene glycol and citric acid for example can be used in forming nanoparticles which is a big advantage from the viewpoint of safety.

An electroless process was developed to produce a Sn Ag alloy that can be deposited without an external power source. The different chemicals used and the process is discussed as follows 

Uniform composition of deposit and constant plating rate are maintained by rigid control of pH and concentration of all chemicals in the stabilized plating bath. Since the plating process is strictly chemical it evenly coats all the metal pads on the plating surface. The deposited alloy is highly uniform in thickness as well as chemical and physical properties. The alloy composition as determined from XPS elemental analysis was SnAgby wt and is shown in .

Suitable catalytic surface treatment was used to selectively deposit the alloy films on the metallic pads. The starting metal salts and reducing agents were optimized to achieve the required final lead free alloy composition.

Because the coating is deposited chemically as compared to electrolytic plating the problems normally associated with electroplating edge build up uneven thickness no plating in corners and recesses for example are avoided herein. Moreover as can be seen from the SEM micrograph of nano grained and nano dimensional films can be achieved with relative ease.

Electroplating is an ideal processing route to make the primary interconnects because of low cost widely available infrastructure and acceptance in the PWB and semiconductor industry. Nanograined copper was selected as the interconnect material in experiments for the present invention. From prior studies the material shows significant improvements in fracture strength and toughness at nanoscale 5 that can address the reliability concerns with fine pitch interconnects. As previously discussed the conductivity of pure copper is 5.96 10Ohm mas compared to a conductivity of 6.9 10Ohm mfor Pb Sn eutectic solders. In addition copper has good electro migration stability that renders high current carrying capability to the interconnects. Thin reworkable interfaces with lowest electrical parasitics was accomplished on the wafer side by a cosputtering process developed by Hionix Inc.

Copper Pads were first fabricated on a silicon substrate. A 0.5 m titanium layer was first sputtered as a adhesion layer between copper and silicon. Thereafter a 1.0 m copper film was sputtered followed by etching of titanium and copper to provide the interconnect pads on the silicon wafer. Once again a thin copper seed layer of 400 nm was sputtered as an electroplating seed layer.

Nano structured copper interconnects were then fabricated using the SU 8 Series 2000 MicroChem Corp. photoresist. SU 8 has very high optical transparency which makes it ideally suited for imaging near vertical sidewalls in very thick films and is near UV 350 400 nm and e beam imageable. It has superb chemical resistance that makes it suitable for a variety of electrolytic plating bath chemistries. Another advantage includes faster drying of the film.

The SU 8 Series 2000 photoresist has a very poor adhesion with copper. Therefore to enhance the adhesion of the photoresist film with the copper seed layer a coupling agent Omnicoat MicroChem Corp. was first spinned on to the silicon substrate with copper seed layer. SU 8 photoresist was then spinned and exposed to yield the mold for interconnect plating. Nano grained copper was then electroplated through the SU 8 mold to yield copper interconnects.

The grain size of the electroplated copper are of the order of 50 70 nm. One major drawback with nanocrystalline copper is the lack of thermal stability of grain structure with temperature. This can be easily addressed with appropriate additives that can prevent grain coarsening.

A thin barrier layer of Nickel and Gold was sputtered onto the wafer with SU 8 mold intact and thereafter patterned and etched to leave the barrier metallurgy on top of copper interconnects. The thickness of Nickel was approximately 200 nm and that of Gold was about 100 nm. It was also attempted to deposit the Ni Au interface using the immersion plating process but the process lead to peeling of the SU 8 film due to the highly corrosive environment and high temperature of the plating bath.

High aspect ratio nano structured copper interconnects were fabricated in a single step using the SU 8 Series 2000 MicroChem Corp. photoresist. SU 8 has very high optical transparency which makes it ideally suited for imaging near vertical sidewalls in very thick films and is near UV 350 400 nm and e beam imageable. Resist thickness ranging from 50 m to 200 ms can be achieved with single spin coat process. Besides it has superb chemical resistance that makes it suitable for a variety of electrolytic plating bath chemistries. Other advantages include improved wetting on silicon glass metals and other low surface energy substrates and faster drying of the film.

In this work interconnects with 20 m diameter 100 m height and 40 m pitch were fabricated on a Silicon wafer. Shown in are the high aspect ratio nano structured copper interconnects grown from the bottom seed layer using electrolytic plating. A current of 10 20 mAmps was used to plate these structures. The process can be subsequently modified to fabricate interconnects with optimum compliancy and electrical properties.

The primary interconnects were fabricated by electroplating through the SU 8 trenches. These interconnects were fabricated on a chrome coated silicon wafer to ensure the adhesion between copper interconnects and the silicon. The process can be easily modified to fabricate the interconnects on any desired pad metallurgy. illustrate interconnects according to preferred embodiments of the present invention.

The bonding capability of nano dimensional lead free alloy films obtained by the electroless plating technique was evaluated in this part of the work. Lead free solder films were electroless plated on an organic laminate FR 4 as well as a gold coated silicon wafer. These nano dimensional films should be able to provide the mechanical and electrical interface between the nano interconnects and metal pads on the substrate.

Assembly was accomplished with the lead free solder film deposited on the top of the nano interconnects. Bonding is preferably achieved by applying pressure to the chip for less than 10 seconds while the reflow temperature was kept at approximately 250 C. A thin coating of flux 9171 Alfa Metals was deposited by spin coating on the lead free alloy film on metal pads before bonding. Such a bond can allow subsequent removal of the chip by locally heating the bonding interface.

While the invention has been disclosed in its preferred forms it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications additions and deletions can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention and its equivalents as set forth in the following claims.
