title: Method and system for providing automated audible backchannel responses
abstract: A voice processing system comprises a processing device that processes and receives a stream of voice input as a user is speaking. A software program executes program steps for determining a predetermined pattern of speech and silence during processing of stream of voice input so as to play or present the predetermined backchannel response to the user. A method provides an audible backchannel response between the voice processing system and the user, while the user is speaking, in particular, recording a message. The method includes monitoring the message to determine a predetermined pattern of speech and silence based on timing between the speech and silence periods. Then, the method produces the audible backchannel response based on the predetermined pattern. An audible user interface includes a speech processor that processes or classifies an audio message in the telecommunication device as speech and silence frame while a calling party is speaking, in particular, recording the audio message to a called party. A control circuitry cooperates with the speech processor and responds to a predetermined pattern of the speech and silence segments so as to play the preset backchannel response in audible form to the calling party.

This application is a continuation of claims priority to and incorporates by reference herein in its entirety U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09 790 885 filed 23 Feb. 2001 now U.S. Pat. No. 6 941 269.

The present invention generally relates to the field of voice processing and more particularly to a method and system for providing automated audible backchannel responses while a person is speaking to a voice recording or input device.

The use of voice processing technology in both public and private telecommunication networks is widespread. The most familiar type of voice processing technology is a telephone system equipped with a voice mail system. In a voice mail system an incoming caller is routed to a voice mailbox associated with a particular person or department. The particular owner of the voice mailbox may not be available to speak immediately to the caller. The caller is then invited to leave or record a message on the system in a similar fashion to telephone answering machines. Many callers would rather speak to a live person than a computerized machine and some callers avoid leaving a message. At least some of these persons find speaking to a voice messaging system an unpleasant experience in part because the voice messaging system may not give responsive feedback during the recording session. This responsive feedback is generally denoted as audible backchannel responses such as mm hummm O.K. yeah iuh huh or yes . These backchannel responses generally are what a human listener normally says while listening to another person speaking.

The purpose of backchannel responses is to make the speaker feel more natural and comfortable during speech. These audible backchannel responses are generally utterances during a conversation that signifies to the speaker that the listener has understood what the speaker spoke. In particular when one person is recording a spoken message on an automated recording device for delivery to another there are no backchannel responses provided to the person. Without backchannel responses the speaker generally becomes less efficient in communication and uncomfortable. Thus a spoken message recorded on the automated recording device such as a voice mail system may be longer and sometimes difficult to understand.

Research has shown that people speaking on the telephone while leaving a message tend to repeat themselves and use more words to convey the same information when they do not hear backchannel responses. This additional message length tends to cause a storage medium such as a hard disk drive of voice messaging systems to become full. Telecommunication managers must spend additional labor resources to clean the system storage purchase additional storage capacity or force the voice mailbox owner to delete messages. This can increase the operating cost of using voice messaging systems in terms of additional labor hours and out of pocket capital equipment expenditures. Therefore if the length of messages can be shortened the storage space and money can be saved.

Conventional voice processing systems do not provide automated backchannel responses keyed to the caller while the caller is speaking in particular recording or dictating a message. Voice messaging systems only record a message by allowing the caller to speak first. The current available voice messaging systems play pre recorded messages or voice prompts to the caller at the end of the speaker s message or post recording. After the caller finishes the recorded message the voice mail or processing system or automated attendant tells the caller what to do for navigating in the system. Further interactive voice response IVR systems do not provide automated backchannel responses. Conventional IVR systems generally perform an action upon receiving an audible voice command or telephone keypad input. The audible voice command takes the place of keyboard input. Some IVR systems provide audible information such as stock quotes or banking account information. IVR provide conversational responses by either waiting for the end of a voice command to perform an action or to play pre recorded information. Again the voice commands are post processing. Some voice mail systems or IVR systems prompt the user by alerting or beeping the user to a time limit for the message. This alerting or beeping is not a backchannel response based on the speech and silence pattern in the voice of the user.

There has been some research in the area of backchannel responses. For example the authors Ward and Tsukahara in 328 2000 discloses research that focuses on the changes in sound or pitch in the speaker s voice to determine when to produce a backchannel response. This research discloses focusing on prosodic cues in which to trigger a backchannel response. There must be software to determine the syntactic cues in a person speech. There is no disclosure of a voice processing system that uses the pattern of speech and non speech to determine when to produce a backchannel response for a user.

Voice transcription devices are known in the art. Some are hand held devices and computer based systems as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 197 052 to Schroder et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 122 614 to Kahn et al. Some transcription devices convert speech to text using speech recognition software. Conventional voice transcription devices lack the ability to facilitate the dictation process by providing automated backchannel responses based on the speech pattern of a user.

As both consumers and businesses are flooded with electronic messages in various media types the ability to process these messages efficiently becomes more valuable. Thus what is needed is a system and method of providing audible backchannel responses in voice processing systems without the aforementioned drawbacks of conventional voice processing technology. In particular what is needed is a voice messaging system that treats the problem at the source by influencing the caller or speaker to leave a shorter message for more efficient voice messages. Also what is needed is a voice recording messaging system that simulates a human listener.

In view of the foregoing the present invention is directed to a system and method of providing an audible backchannel response to a user that overcomes the problems in the prior art.

In an embodiment of the present invention a voice processing system comprises a processing device that receives and processes a stream of voice input as a user is speaking. A storage device is included in the voice processing system that stores the processed voice input and other data in computer readable code. A predetermined backchannel response is held in the storage device for later use. The present invention further includes a software program that executes or operates with the processing device. The software program executes program steps for determining a predetermined pattern of speech and non speech during processing of the voice stream input so as to play or present the predetermined backchannel response to the user. In this way one advantage includes a voice processing or voice messaging system which can process voice data more efficiently.

In another embodiment of the present invention a method provides an audible backchannel response between the voice processing system and the user while the user is speaking in particular recording a message. The method includes monitoring the message to determine a predetermined pattern of speech and silence based on timing between the speech and silence periods. Then the method produces the audible backchannel response based on the predetermined pattern. Further steps of the method include monitoring the message for a period of speech to determine an elapsed time of speech and monitoring the message for a period of non speech for determining an elapsed time of non speech. Also the elapsed time of speech is compared to a predetermined time period of speech and the elapsed period of non speech is compared to a predetermined time period of non speech. In this way one advantage includes the audible backchannel response being played while a user is speaking so as to provide natural conditions for composing a message to a computerized device.

In another aspect of the present invention an audible user interface for a telecommunication device is provided. The audible user interface includes a speech processor that processes or classifies an audio message in the telecommunication device as speech and silence frame while a calling party is speaking in particular recording the audio message to a called party. The user interface includes a preset backchannel response located in a memory. In addition a control circuitry cooperates with the speech processor and responds to a predetermined pattern of the speech and silence segments so as to play the preset backchannel response in audible form to the calling party. In this way one advantage includes providing realistically simulated backchannel responses to make the calling party feel more natural and comfortable by simulating a human listener.

These and other objects features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description thereof presented in connection with the following drawings in which like reference numerals identify the elements throughout.

There is shown in an illustration of embodiments of the present invention a system and method for processing the voice of a user to provide automated backchannel responses. The system and method uses a predetermined pattern of speech and non speech in an audible message that causes the system of the present invention to produce an audible backchannel response. In an embodiment one system is generally referred to herein as a voice processing system and is designated as reference numeral .

Audio connection comprises hardware and software to receive an audible voice from a telephone handset a microphone a public telecommunications network the Internet or any network. The analog digital converter is operatively coupled or wired to the audio connection . The analog digital converter receives analog voice signals and transforms the signals into digital data. The transformation of voice signals into a digital data can be accomplished in a number of ways. For example the voice signals may be sampled by using pulse code modulation. Analog digital converter includes a digital signal processor a CODEC and related circuitry.

Control circuitry includes electronic hardware and software provided for execution of program steps in computer readable code. Control circuitry has software that performs arithmetic and logical functions including programs for operational control of the various components of the system. Control circuitry is operatively coupled to the analog digital converter speech detector backchannel response application program backchannel responses prerecorded voice prompts control input and voice message storage medium . This coupling is accomplished via wiring and functional commands with operating systems. Control circuitry may include a specific purpose microprocessor such as for processing voice input for a user. A speaker or user produces a stream of voice input that is composed of a successive plurality of phonemes.

Speech detector comprises hardware and software that classifies incoming audio data via the audio connection as speech or silence. Speech detector may be configured to provide a sound energy level of the incoming voice data in which a level below a pre determined threshold level is classified as silence. The term silence being defined herein as non speech or alternatively stated the absence of speech. In the embodiments illustrated while a user is speaking or producing a plurality of phonemes a pause by the user may be interpreted or processed as silence e.g. non speech or absence of speech . It is recognized that the voice data can contain may different types of sounds or patterns of sounds. These patterns and types of sounds can be separated into classes of sound types such as speech or non speech. The speech detector with the appropriate software can determine or recognize voice input that is speech non speech or speech with background noise.

Speech detector is operatively coupled to analog digital converter and related circuitry. Speech detector may be supplied with existing voice computer telephony printed circuit boards with interfacing driver software. The printed circuit board hardware is configured to report sound data to the driver software. The speech detector may be embodied in a voice modem such as MODEM BLASTER PCI manufactured by CREATIVE TECHNOLOGY LTD using a MICROSOFT Telephone application Programming Interface TAPI and Sound Application Programming Interface SAPI computer telephony cards such as Dialogic D 41ESC D 160SC LS Proline 2V or DM V1200 4E1 using SPRINGWARE Software and corresponding Software Development Kit SDK .

Backchannel response program is an application program including executable steps that receives data from the speech detector so as to determine a predetermined pattern of speech and silence segments in the audio input. Based on the predetermined pattern backchannel response program provides commands to play a backchannel response to user. This method will be described in detail below. The backchannel response program can embody a computer program product in a computer usable medium such as a floppy drive optical disk magnetic hardware drive programmable memory or any other device that stores digital data for processing. The computer usable medium includes computer readable code that causes a computer to execute a series of steps. The computer readable code may be stored on a server connected to a public switched telecommunications network such as the Internet including the World Wide Web. This allows backchannel response program to be transmitted via a carrier wave to be downloaded to a destination client such as a personal computer or a voice mail server. In an alternative embodiment application program may be embodied in firmware such as application specified integrated circuits ASIC . The ASIC enables the backchannel response program to be included in voice transcription devices like digital recorders or included on computer telephony printed circuit boards.

Backchannel responses are embodied in the various computerized audio responses selectively stored on a computer usable storage medium such as a hard disk optical disk floppy disk programmable memory or any other device that stores digital data for processing. The backchannel responses are produced by a speech synthesis mechanism in which the system generates sounds by splicing together prerecorded words. In addition speech synthesis is generated by programming circuitry to produce audible sounds that make up the spoken words. The backchannel responses can be embodied in any appropriate digital encoded files such as waveform audio format WAV or formats used on the Internet and the World Wide Web.

These prerecorded responses are phrases that may be any appropriate backchannel response while not an exhaustive list some examples include mm hummm O.K. yeah uh huh yes right good go on got it ah nah got it alright okie dokie you don t say or go ahead . In another embodiment the backchannel responses can be various catch phrases slogans or portions thereof. A catch phrase generally relates to popular culture. A catch phrase is a word or words made popular through the media such as television radio motion pictures Internet advertising or music video. Some examples of catch phrases include oh boy I am here works for me or I heard that . Some catch phrases generally have value for media companies similar to trademarks. While these recorded messages are in the English language the present invention is not so limited the backchannel responses may be applied to other languages that have a speech structure similar to English such as Spanish.

For additional comfort to the speaker or caller an embodiment enables a designated owner of a voice mailbox to record or sample the backchannel responses in their own unique voice. In another embodiment the system provides for the designated owner of the mailbox to record a voice imprint having the tonal characteristics of their voice. This advantageously provides for the system to synthesize other voices. For example the owner of the mailbox or system may want the caller or speaker to hear a backchannel response in the voice of a famous person. This adds additional comfort to the speaker or caller. In addition the system provides for the voice imprints to be adjusted by a digital sound manipulation device such as provided on voice modem printed circuit boards. An exemplary method of recording the backchannel responses will be described in the foregoing.

Similar to backchannel response program backchannel responses can be embodied in a carrier wave to be transported via an electronic signal such as network transport. This enables backchannel responses to be transmitted via the carrier wave for download to a destination client such as a personal computer or a voice mail server. Equally backchannel responses may be uploaded from a client to a server or a network. In an alternative embodiment backchannel response program may be embodied in read only memory or erasable programmable memory such as flash memory. This enables backchannel responses to be included in digital recorders computer telephony printed circuit boards or with other devices for recording a voice message that includes microprocessor.

Referring to prerecorded or synthesized voice prompts are the part of voice processing system that instructs the caller or user how to access the system. In the exemplary embodiment the caller is presented with a hierarchical menu of options by the system . Each menu option is logically mapped to a specific action or command executed by the voice processing system . Voice prompts are similar to menu commands found in conventional voice mail systems.

Another component of the present invention is the control input . Control input comprises hardware and software for controlling and directing the system . For example control input can be any form of input that a general voice messaging system uses such as a dual tone multi frequency DTMF signal touch tone a code word recognizer a keyboard input or a mouse click. Control input and voice prompts operated in conjunction so that a caller or user can navigate the menus and use the voice processing system .

The incoming audio of voice messages by the caller is stored on a voice message storage unit VMSU . Voice processing system of the present invention converts the analog audio voice messages from the caller into digital format by analog digital recorded . VMSU selectively stores the voice messages on a computer usable storage medium such as a hard disk drive or floppy drive. The drives and their associated computer readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer readable instructions data structures program modules and other data for system . Although the processing system described herein employs a hard disk drive or floppy disk it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that other types of computer readable media which can store data that is accessible by a voice processing system such as magnetic cassettes flash memory cards random access memories RAMs read only memories ROMs and the like may also be used in the processing system.

In use during the recording of the voice message from the caller the voice message is recorded and stored in real time. The caller will hear the backchannel responses in an output speaker on a telephone handset or through standalone speakers but the system generated backchannel responses will not be recorded while the caller is recording a message.

Other features of the present invention can include a speech segmented device that filters music and noise on the audio connection to classify the speech and non speech accordingly. One such as method of filtering is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 067 517 which is herein fully incorporated by reference. In addition a front end process for identifying the language of a speaker and various corresponding dialects may be implemented. In one embodiment a method includes prompting a user to provide their specific language and or dialect of use. In another embodiment a language identification method uses a computational linguistical method with a parser.

Referring to a flow chart illustrates a method of an embodiment of the present invention. The foregoing method may be embodied in backchannel response application program . This method of the present invention can be also embodied in software instruction language such as C C or others. Then this software instruction can be complied in computer readable code. In use an exemplary backchannel response is produced when the method determines a pattern of speech and silence such that five or more seconds of speech intermixed with periods of silence of less than one half second is followed by one half second of continuous silence. Silence being defined as non speech in that the speaker has temporarily stopped talking as in pausing.

When the voice processing system prompts the speaker to leave a message at step S and S the system is initialized in which a speech timer and a silence timer are set off and reset to zero milliseconds. The speech and silence timers are program steps that count sequential increments of time. The timers are preferably turned off on and reset by function commands in software. The timers preferably count time in milliseconds but other measurement of time can be implemented such as seconds.

As shown in step S the system receives audio input from the caller. Step S also includes the system recording the caller. In other embodiments of the invention the caller or user s voice is not recorded. While the system is recording a spoken message of the caller or user at step S the speech detector monitors or classifies the voice stream input as either speech input or as silence each classification is described in detail herein. If speech detector determines the input as the speech that is the caller is still talking then at step S a speech indicator is set and at step S the speech timer is started. Next as shown in step S the silence timer is reset to zero and turned off.

Now referring to step S if speech detector classifies the voice stream input as silence that is the caller has paused speaking during the recording then at step S the silence indicator is set. Next at step S the silence timer is started so as to measure the elapsed period of silence. At step S the elapsed period of silence is compared to a predetermined silence variable X. Silence variable X is preferably equivalent to 500 milliseconds or one half seconds. If the elapsed period of silence is less than silence variable X the control is transferred to step S for processing additional audio voice stream input. If during the comparison step of S the elapsed period of silence is greater than predetermined silence variable X the control is transferred to step S.

As shown in step S the time period of speech is compared to a predetermined speech variable Y. Predetermined speech variable Y is preferably equivalent to 5000 milliseconds or equivalently five seconds of speech input. If the elapsed period of speech is not greater than predetermined speech variable Y then control is transferred to step S. At step S the speech timer is reset to zero and control execution is then transferred to step S to again receive audio input. If however the elapsed time period of speech is greater than predetermined speech variable Y in the comparison step S the control execution is transferred to step S.

At step S a second comparison of the elapsed period of silence is performed in which the period is compared to a second predetermined silence variable Z. If the elapsed period of silence is less than second silence variable Z then control is transferred to step S for receiving additional audio input. If the elapsed period of silence is greater than second silence variable Z control is transferred to step S.

As shown in step S the system is responsive and plays a backchannel response to the caller or user. When the embodiment of the present invention is applied in the voice processing system backchannel responses are played to the caller or user via a handset speaker or other audio playback device. In addition system can be configured to play only a specific designated backchannel response that is pre selected by the mailbox owner such as uh uh . Alternatively system can be configured to play out a randomly selected backchannel response from backchannel responses when requested by the method of the present invention. The caller or user will hear a different backchannel response which enables the system to make the user interface more natural as in speech with a human listener. The randomly generated backchannel responses also enable the present invention to more simulate a human listener.

After the backchannel response is played control is transferred to steps S S and S in which the speech and silence timers are reset and the system receives audio input. The method of the present invention shown in then is executed in sequence as explained in the foregoing. It should be noted that the predetermined silence speech and second silence variables are not limited to the values of 500 5000 and 500 millisecond respectively. These values can be adjusted or slightly tuned to meet the specific characteristics of speech detector or language of selection.

A user or calling party may initiate a call a second person or a called party on telephone devices . This call is connected to another telephony device via public switched telecommunications network . A call processing system may be a private branch exchange or local exchange switch which includes voice mail system operatively connected thereto. A user of devices will receive prompting from voice mail system via public switched telecommunications network . Because backchannel response program is part of voice mail system the user will hear audible backchannel responses in accordance with the present invention.

Alternatively the backchannel response program could be included in an environment of a digital answering machine or similar telephony device. Here a user could make a call with device and connect to telephone device . Answering machine would run or execute the backchannel response program to provide responses to the caller.

The present invention also may be implemented within an environment of a general purpose computing device in the form of a conventional personal computer including a central processing unit a system memory and a system bus that couples various system components including the system memory to the central processing unit. The system bus may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller a peripheral bus and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures. The general purpose computing device may have an exemplary operating system such as MICROSOFT WINDOWS PALM OS MICROSOFT WINDOWS CE . The system memory includes read only memory ROM and random access memory RAM . In this arrangement the user can provide an audible electronic message for sending to a distal source. Such software is available under a unified electronic messaging configuration. Backchannel response program is executed in the computer processing unit in which when the user desires to dictate a message predetermined backchannel responses are produced in accordance with the method of the present invention. The general purpose computer device is not limited to a personal computer but can embodied in be a personal digital assistant that runs dictation software or may have an audible electronic mail capabilities.

Also the personal computer may operate in a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote devices. A remote device may be another personal computer a telephone a server a router a network PC a peer device or other common network node and typically includes many or all of the elements described above relative to the personal computer . The logical connections include a local area network LAN and a wide area network WAN such AT T Corporation World Net Service. Such networking environments are commonplace in offices enterprise wide computer networks intranets and the Internet.

Referring to an embodiment of a voice transcription system is illustrated. While a user is speaking or dictating to voice transcription system backchannel responses are provided to the user as previously described. Voice transcription system analyzes the speech of a user in real time and procures a string of text. This is similar to speech to text technology. System need not record an audio representation of the voice of the user. In another embodiment system stores speech data in which those features of the speech needed for later analysis can produce text by a suitably equipped computer. The speech data is downloaded to the computer for analysis and transcription. System may be embodied in a handheld or palm size device.

Voice transcription system includes electronic components and software such as a user interface a control circuitry a memory power source control input backchannel response program . The user interface provides audio and visual signals to a user of system . The user interface includes a speaker device a microphone device and a display device . Control circuitry includes hardware and instructions that performs arithmetic and logical functions including programs for operational control of the various components of the system. Control input comprises hardware and software for controlling and directing the system such as a keyboard or buttons. The speaker device provides audible signals to the user of system . Microphone device receives audio input from the user and converts the signals into the appropriate format for the control circuitry to use the signals. Display device provides visual signals to the user in the form of alphanumeric characters colors or graphical symbols. The display device may be any well known display device such as a liquid crystal display. The power source provides the electric power to operate voice transcription system components and functions. A communications connection may be included with system to connect to personal computer or network . A housing encloses the aforementioned internal components of the voice transcription system. Backchannel response program is similar to backchannel response program and implements the same steps.

In other embodiments of the invention backchannel response program can be included in a video telephone and or video conference system where a user leaves a video message television or any set up box type of device that a user can speak by leaving a message or dictation.

Thus what has been described is a system and method of providing and audible backchannel response to a user. While these particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and described it is recognized that various modifications thereof will occur to those skilled in the art. Therefore the scope of the herein described invention shall be limited solely by the claims appended hereto.
